In the winter zone of the valley (Srinagar) and the Jammu region, the government has announced the winter vacation schedule for schools. Pre-primary classes will close from November 26 (Wednesday); classes 1 to 8 will end academic work on December 1; and classes 9 to 12 will stop work from December 11. Schools up to class 8 are set to reopen on March 1, 2026, while higher classes will resume a week earlier, on February 22, 2026. The decision was taken in view of the thermometer dipping several degrees below freezing across Kashmir. In the national capital, the Directorate of Education, Delhi (DoE) has published the school calendar for the academic year 2025-26 stating that the winter vacation will be from January 1 to January 15, 2026. The dates were mentioned in a notice released earlier, dated November last year. However in previous academic years, winter vacations were split and advanced to November due to increased pollution levels and as a precautionary measure. In Uttar Pradesh, information from holiday calendars shows that the New Year/winter vacation for 2025 was scheduled from January 1 to January 15, 2025. However, an official statewide notification specifically for the present academic year 2025-26 winter break has not yet been notified.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) .

Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy.

Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Siddharth Garg There is a widely believed misconception amongst students and parents, that if a student prepares rigorously for the Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), they will have to give up their preparation for the board exams . There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Also Read | CAT 2025: How to progress by analysing mock test results Here’s that race plan— the same one I share with students facing CAT, XAT , and other high-stakes tests. When the timer starts, don’t dive in. Spend 120 seconds to see the terrain: question types, section spread, and obvious quick wins. Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean. Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains. If you can’t see a path in 30 seconds, tag it and move. Accuracy beats volume.

Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Also Read | CAT 2025: How to progress by analysing mock test results Here’s that race plan— the same one I share with students facing CAT, XAT , and other high-stakes tests. When the timer starts, don’t dive in. Spend 120 seconds to see the terrain: question types, section spread, and obvious quick wins. Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean. Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains. If you can’t see a path in 30 seconds, tag it and move. Accuracy beats volume.

India requires over 1.5 lakh veterinarians, but has only 61,943 trained professionals, leaving a 60 per cent shortfall, according to a study published in the Indian Journal of Animal Sciences. The demand is projected to rise sharply to 2.84 lakh by 2040, underscoring the urgent need for expanded private-sector capacity in veterinary education and services in West Bengal.

The Language and Cognition Laboratory, established within the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, is claimed as the first lab in India dedicated to systematically exploring the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWhen the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ) was founded at Dholpur House in New Delhi in 1958, it marked a turning point in India’s education system – one that bore the imprint of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the country’s first education minister. Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge.

Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement.

Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant. “Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.

The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “ Your Custom Feed .” The new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want. For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future. While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options. YouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.

For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want. For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future. While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options. YouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nCharacter.AI announced on Tuesday that it’s launching “ Stories ,” a new format that allows users to create interactive fiction that features their favorite characters. The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week. The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all. “Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.” Interactive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted. On the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move. “I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote.

OpenAI announced on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode. That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode. During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text. You can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed. You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time. Rolling out to all users on mobile and web.

The company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report. Pony.ai, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber. The ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs.

The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024 . The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia. A Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month. The report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million. Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO . The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.

Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO . The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday, more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020 . It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery. Companies, from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China.

On Tuesday, Accel and Google announced a partnership to jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through Accel’s Atoms program, with both firms contributing up to $1 million. The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one. “The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch. India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI , where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China. Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including OpenAI and Anthropic have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products. Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.” Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.

These are our favorite computer monitors of the many we've tested so far. There are hundreds of different kinds of PC monitors out there, so we're continually testing and updating this guide. You'll also find monitor buying advice that explains any jargon you might not know. Be sure to check out other home office guides, including the Best Gaming Monitors , Best Home Office Gear , Best Laptops , and Best USB Hubs . Updated November 2025: We've added the LG UltraFine 6K monitor. Dell Amazon Dell There was a time when recommending a 4K monitor for “most people” felt silly. But when 4K monitors like the Dell 27 Plus 4K (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are selling for the same price as 1080p models, there's little reason not to spring for the extra pixels. 27-inch monitors with 4K resolution make for incredible sharpness, and with this display's 120-Hz refresh rate , animation and motion are buttery smooth too. Throw in the included AMD FreeSync Ultimate support, and you've got a decent little gaming monitor when it needs to be. I was even impressed by the pair of 5-watt speakers, which are surprisingly full-sounding. For a display this crisp, along with its simple white aesthetic, you'll be hard-pressed to find a model under $300 that has this much going for it. As much as I really like this monitor, though, there are a couple of downsides worth mentioning, namely the lack of USB ports. Fortunately, Dell ha"}
{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWhen DoorDash delivery driver Livie Rose Henderson posted a video alleging that one of her customers sexually assaulted her in October, it set off a firestorm of reactions. Henderson’s TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer’s front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok’s algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson’s November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.) None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose. But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash’s decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer’s personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jeff Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.” “Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.” “Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off.

NASA and Boeing are now targeting no earlier than April 2026 to fly the uncrewed Starliner-1 mission, the space agency said. Launching by next April will require completion of rigorous test, certification, and mission readiness activities, NASA added in a statement . “NASA and Boeing are continuing to rigorously test the Starliner propulsion system in preparation for two potential flights next year,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in a statement. NASA also said it has reached an agreement with Boeing to modify the Commercial Crew contract, signed in 2014, that called for six crewed flights to the space station following certification of the spacecraft. Now the plan is to fly Starliner-1 carrying cargo, and then up to three additional missions before the space station is retired. “This modification allows NASA and Boeing to focus on safely certifying the system in 2026, execute Starliner’s first crew rotation when ready, and align our ongoing flight planning for future Starliner missions based on station’s operational needs through 2030,” Stich said. SpaceX and Boeing were both awarded contracts in 2014 to develop crewed spacecraft and fly six operational missions to the space station.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWe can debate the worthiness of Elon Musk's accomplishments—building up Tesla , hollowing out the government , shooting for Mars —but we can all agree that his insistence on being seen as funny is his most grating quality. From the constant 4:20 references to his quote tweet “dunks” to awarding “ Certified Bangers ” badges to silly X posts, Musk’s desperation for validation knows no bounds. It can get pretty annoying when the richest guy on earth makes a joke and then awkwardly eyes the room waiting for everyone to laugh. But over the weekend, I was intrigued when a clip emerged of Musk telling Joe Rogan that using Grok’s Unhinged Mode to deliver an “epic vulgar roast” is a surefire way to “make people really laugh at a party.” “Point the camera at them, and now do a vulgar roast of this person … then keep saying, ‘no, no, make it even more vulgar. Use forbidden words,’” Musk excitedly tells Rogan in the clip taken from their three-hour-plus conversation published on Rogan’s podcast in October. “Eventually it's like, holy fuck, you know. I mean it’s trying to jam a rocket up your ass and have it explode. It’s next level. Beyond fucking belief,” he continues, chuckling and even raising his arms above his head at the mere thought. The best roast jokes tend to be smart, reflect a familiarity with the person being roasted, and contain just the right amount of mean. It’s not a task one would think a large language model would be great at. But, with Thanksgiving and holiday season on the horizon, I figured why not test Musk’s claim that Grok can deliver a foul-mouthed razz with the best of them? I gave it a test spin at the office by turning Grok loose on my colleagues. (I do not recommend anyone else do this at work.)

After all, some people want a simpler entry into the world of PC gaming that doesn't involve tinkering. That's where a PC like the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes into play—in theory. While Alienware typically addresses the higher-end demographic with its gaming desktops and laptops, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is the company's most serious attempt yet to offer its gaming goods at a lower price. Overall, I've been happy with what you get with the Aurora, especially when I've seen sales that dip the price to $1,500.

And the alien head itself is the power button. Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop Rating: 7/10 It’s accurate to say that the Aurora feels like a gamer skin on the Dell Tower Plus, but that’s not a complaint. I found a lot to like about the way Dell balanced ease of use, upgradability, and price—and it translates well enough for gaming hardware. It’s not using fully off-the-shelf parts, but there’s enough here to make specific upgrades well into the future.

Beyond that, it has an attention-grabbing design and off-the-charts image quality.

I wouldn't blame you for mistaking this as an Apple product, given the focus on clean lines, simple shapes, and designerly aesthetic. The extra-wide stand means that the base itself isn’t overly large. Like the Apple Studio Display , the flat base provides more usable desk space rather than occupying it.

One might believe the lack of consensus is a Mainstream Media™ psyop to keep people scrambling for marketable solutions to a problem that’s completely made up, but the cottage industry of coffee alternatives that’s proliferated by this endless tug of war is an interesting outcome regardless of which side you’re on. This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance. Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane , chaga , and cordyceps —boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, including our top pick, Atlas Coffee Club’s Latte Superblend ($26) , swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging. Some hit like a mild cup of coffee, some were actual coffee , and others were uncanny concoctions no normal person would ever crave unless they were fully indoctrinated in the heady lifestyle this unique alt-beverage industry revolves around. I laughed, I cried, I got the runs, and I crashed on my couch in the early afternoon more times than I could count, all for science, and all so you don’t have to try this on your own.

One might believe the lack of consensus is a Mainstream Media™ psyop to keep people scrambling for marketable solutions to a problem that’s completely made up, but the cottage industry of coffee alternatives that’s proliferated by this endless tug of war is an interesting outcome regardless of which side you’re on. This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance. Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane , chaga , and cordyceps —boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, including our top pick, Atlas Coffee Club’s Latte Superblend ($26) , swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging. Some hit like a mild cup of coffee, some were actual coffee , and others were uncanny concoctions no normal person would ever crave unless they were fully indoctrinated in the heady lifestyle this unique alt-beverage industry revolves around. I laughed, I cried, I got the runs, and I crashed on my couch in the early afternoon more times than I could count, all for science, and all so you don’t have to try this on your own.

These accounts largely post about divisive issues, including immigration, gender, and Israel. In one instance, a verified account called MAGA NATION with almost 400,000 followers and the American flag in its screen name was revealed to be operated from a non-EU country in Eastern Europe.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool.

Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino?

Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes. Thankfully, the mirrored silver and classic black are marked down to the lower $249 price point, with varying discounts on the other options, like $299 for the brushed silver ,"}

The console you spent countless hours huddled around as a kid is now old enough to be crippled by student debt and burdened with existential despair, just like you! If that reminder of the cruel and ceaseless march of time makes you want to retreat into a nostalgic bubble when life was easier and, say, play some N64 games, unfortunately, that's been pretty tricky in recent years.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Noida district hospital to constitute a primary board to explore passive euthanasia for a 31-year-old man suffering from 100 per cent disability quadriplegia and who has been in a vegetative state for over a decade, saying his health condition has gone from bad to worse. “We want the primary board to give us a report that life-sustaining treatment can be withheld. Let the primary board place its report at the earliest, and once it is before us, we shall proceed to pass further orders. Let this exercise be done within two weeks,” a bench of justices JB Pardiwala and KV Viswanathan directed, reported PTI. Passive euthanasia is the intentional act of letting a patient die by withholding or withdrawing life support or treatment necessary for maintaining life. The bench asked the district hospital at Noida in sector 39 to file its report within two weeks on an application filed by father of 31-year-old Harish Rana seeking passive euthanasia for him saying his health condition has gone from bad to worse.

The DOJ’s disclosure marks the most detailed account yet of a chaotic episode from March, when flights carrying Venezuelan detainees continued toward El Salvador despite emergency directives from US District Judge James Boasberg to keep them in the United States. The filing names several senior figures involved in the decision, including: Kristi Noem, Homeland Security Secretary Todd Blanche, Deputy Attorney General Judge Emil Bove, then a senior Justice Department official According to the government, Noem made the final call not to turn the planes around after receiving legal advice from Blanche, Bove and a top DHS lawyer.

GRAP 3 curbs prohibited all inter-state buses, from the NCR region (except electric and CNG vehicles and BS-VI diesel buses) from entering Delhi, with schools operating in hybrid mode for classes up to Standard 5, among other measures. With the withdrawal of the Stage-3 measures, the 50% work-from-home mandate for offices has been discontinued and the hybrid mode of classes being followed by schools has also been revoked, Delhi Environment Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa said in a post on X. Earlier, the Delhi government had instructed all its offices and private establishments to operate with 50% staff on-site , with the remaining employees working from home. Here's what changes under GRAP I and GRAP II: GRAP Stage 1 mandates the following measures in Delhi: 2. Ban on open waste burning, limit diesel generator use, and ban the use of coal or firewood in eateries. 3. Public transport remains open, with the public urged to use it more instead of individual cars.

The fire began around 2:50 p.m., and the Fire Services Department upgraded it to a No. 5 alarm — the city’s highest classification — shortly after 6:20 p.m. More than 128 fire trucks and 57 ambulances were deployed as hundreds of firefighters battled dangerous conditions, including falling debris, collapsing scaffolding and extreme heat inside the towers. Deputy Fire Services Director Derek Armstrong Chan said temperatures were so high that crews struggled to enter the buildings. Authorities said they received numerous calls from residents unable to escape. Many of the trapped were believed to be elderly, according to Tai Po District Council member Lo Hiu-fung. More than 700 people were evacuated to temporary shelters. Among the 13 confirmed dead was a 37-year-old firefighter who collapsed at the scene and later died in hospital.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.
