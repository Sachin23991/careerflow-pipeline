Federal Election Commission, a landmark case in which the justices struck down legal limits on independent political spending by corporations and unions, allowing a flood of new money to enter politics.\nThe court has been chipping away at campaign finance restrictions ever since. The case the justices will consider on Tuesday involves one of the remaining limits: how much money political parties can spend in coordination with candidates.\nThe case, \nNational Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission\n, was brought by national Republican leaders, who argue that the limits violate the First Amendment, restricting their ability to reach and influence voters.\nDepending on its scope, such a decision could swing the pendulum of power back toward the official political parties and away from super PACs. It could also allow parties to spend huge sums from big donors directly on candidates, potentially expanding the influence of big money compared with small-dollar contributions. Democrats in recent years have done better than Republicans at winning smaller donations.\nIn practical terms, a win for the Republicans could have an immediate impact on the midterm elections, shrinking one of the Democratic Party’s major financial advantages: lower costs for political candidates who directly buy broadcast advertising time.\nUnder federal law, broadcasters must offer political candidates low advertising rates. But they are not required to give super PACs those same low rates. \nSuper PACs often pay double, triple and even four times as much money\n for the same TV spots as do candidates.\nIn recent years, Democratic candidates have tended to \nvastly\n \nout-raise\n Republican candidates, who have been more reliant on the support of super PACs and national party committees, which can accept larger donations. In practice, that means Democratic candidates have been able to take advantage of these lower ad rates more often than Republicans.\nA ruling in the case is expected by July.

If the court decides to allow unlimited spending by the parties in coordination with the candidates, party committees will suddenly also be guaranteed those cheaper rates — an outcome that campaign finance experts say would probably especially benefit Republicans and potentially save the G.O.P. tens of millions of dollars next fall.\nWhile an individual donor can give only $3,500 to a candidate during an election cycle, \na donor can give\n up to $44,300 to a national party committee’s general fund each year and hundreds of thousands more to specialty accounts. If the Supreme Court lifts limits on party committees to coordinate with candidates, the parties could use the large contributions they raise from wealthy donors to pay for low ad rates.\nThe ad price disparity is so big that \nRepublicans have been testing various other ways to skirt\n the existing law while this challenge has been winding its way through the courts.\nIn 2026, the committees of both national parties that are focused on the House and Senate races will probably be financially closely matched. But the Republican National Committee itself has an edge over the Democratic National Committee, with far more cash on hand, about $91 million. The D.N.C. recently had only $18 million on hand \nafter taking out a $15 million loan.\nDemocrats would probably make it a huge priority to raise money for the party committees should Republicans win at the court, potentially making a G.O.P. advantage short-lived.\nThe dispute before the Supreme Court began on Nov. 4, 2022, when national Republican leaders and two Ohio political candidates, including Vice President JD Vance, who was then running for the Senate, sued the Federal Election Commission.\nThe challengers argued that federal campaign finance laws unfairly limited political party committees “from doing what the First Amendment entitles them to do: fully associate with and advocate for their own candidates for federal office.”\nThe commission regularly updates limits on how much political parties can spend in coordination with candidates for each election cycle.

These expenditures primarily funded political advertising.\nSuch spending limits between party committees and candidates were established in 1974 in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal and had been previously upheld by the Supreme Court in 2001 in a case brought by Colorado Republicans.\nIn that case, the justices found in a 5-to-4 decision that limits spending on were necessary. Eliminating the limits, the majority concluded, could allow wealthy donors to circumvent federal limits on contributions to individual candidates.\n The limits are strict — a total of $7,000 for a federal candidate every two years. Super PACs, however, face no limits at all so long as they advertise independently of the candidates they are supporting.\nThe case now before the Supreme Court was previously heard by a panel of 16 judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, a process called en banc review.\nThe challengers argued that the law and facts on the ground had changed since the Supreme Court’s 2001 decision, making it no longer binding on lower courts. They pointed to subsequent decisions by the Supreme Court tightening free-speech restrictions on campaign finance regulations.\nIn September 2024, the divided federal appeals court \nrejected that argument\n and upheld the legality of the regulation. In an opinion written by Jeffrey S. Sutton, the chief judge of the circuit and an appointee of President George W. Bush, the court held that “the key reality” was that “the Supreme Court has not overruled the 2001 Colorado decision.”\nJudge Sutton noted that the court’s more recent rulings in other cases suggested a view that limiting money in politics violated the First Amendment, but said that lower courts did not have the authority to overrule Supreme Court precedent.\n“A political party exists to get its candidates elected,” lawyers for the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote in \na brief\n asking the justices to weigh in, adding that “Congress has severely restricted how much parties can spend on their own campaign advertising if done in cooperation with those very candidates.”\nThe Biden administration had defe"}

The justices will also hear from lawyers for Democratic organizations, who intervened in the case and support the finance limits.\nIn a brief, lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and other groups argued that the case was not about the First Amendment but instead about “whether the Constitution guarantees parties an unlimited right — unique among political bodies — to subsidize the campaign expenses of federal candidates.” They added, “It does not.”"}

Kavanaugh posed a question to the lawyer representing the Trump administration: What about the Federal Reserve?\nThe case before the court concerns Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission whom President Trump wants to fire. Though a federal law requires him to provide a reason, he maintains that the Constitution’s separation of powers allows him to remove such officials for any reason or no reason at all.\nDuring the arguments, it was clear that Mr. Trump was heading toward a sweeping victory, one that would allow him to exert complete control over the F.T.C. and many other agencies that Congress had sought to insulate from political interference. There was only one hurdle.\nHis lawyer, Solicitor General D. John Sauer, had to satisfy the justices that a ruling in his favor would not jeopardize the independence of the Fed, which could spook the markets and endanger the economy.\nThis required a principled theory, and it was not clear whether Mr. Sauer had one.\n“General Sauer, can I ask you about the Federal Reserve?” Justice Kavanaugh asked. “The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns. So, how would you distinguish the Federal Reserve from agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission?”\nThe Fed will figure in a case to be argued next month involving Lisa D. Cook, a Fed governor whom Mr. Trump has tried to fire.\nMr. Sauer’s answer to Justice Kavanaugh’s question on Monday, which must have been tested and honed as he prepared for the argument, basically cited an earlier statement from the court that was not notable for its clarity.\nIn May, in \nan unsigned opinion\n letting Mr. Trump temporarily remove leaders of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board, the majority had gone out of its way to carve out the Fed, whose status was not, at that time, before the court.\n“The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,” the opinion said.\nOn Monday, Mr. Sauer noted that the sentence contained some important parts of speech. “There’s two adjectives there or an adjective and an adverb,” he said, pointing to “unique” and “distinct.”\n“Th"}

But in that instance, Mr. Trump has asserted he has cause — an allegation that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied wrongdoing. The court has let Ms. Cook keep her job for now, and it will hear arguments in her case next month.\nMr. Trump, in an effort to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates, has mused about trying to fire Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, but he has not followed through. Indeed, no president has sought to remove a member of the Fed board without cause.\nJustice Elena Kagan indicated that the logic of Mr. Sauer’s position should include the Fed. “Once you’re down this road,” she said, “it’s a little bit hard to see how you stop.”\nMr. Sauer said the distinctions the court had already drawn should suffice. “So it isn’t that we have gone down this road,” he said. “I think the court has been down this road.”\nJustice Kavanaugh, for his part, has long been concerned with preserving the independence of the Fed. He wrote about it in \na 2009 article\n in The Minnesota Law Review as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, before his elevation to the Supreme Court.\n“In some situations,” he wrote, “it may be worthwhile to insulate particular agencies from direct presidential oversight or control — the Federal Reserve Board may be one example, due to its power to directly affect the short-term functioning of the U.S. economy by setting interest rates a"}

On Tuesday, the president will go to Pennsylvania for the first of what the White House calls a series of speeches addressing the “affordability” problem, which last week \nhe dismissed\n as “the greatest con job” ever conceived by Democrats.\nChina, the world’s second-largest economy and the United States’ main economic and technological competitor, released figures on Monday showing that it continues to run a record trade surplus with the rest of the world, even as its overall trade and surplus with the U.S. narrows. That suggests Beijing is quickly learning how to thrive even in a world in which the United States becomes a tougher place to do business.\nAnd there is scant evidence to date of any wholesale return to American towns and cities of the manufacturing jobs lost to decades of automation and globalization.\nMr. Trump insists that his signature decision to impose the highest tariffs on American imports since 1930 is working, or will soon. He continues to blame his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., for every economic woe, though the argument is getting thinner and thinner as he approaches, in just six weeks, his first anniversary in office.\nHe finds himself in roughly the place Mr. Biden did in early 2024: Telling the American people that they are doing great, when many \ndon’t feel that way\n.

Last week, he declared at a cabinet meeting that “at some point in the not too distant future, you wouldn’t even have income tax to pay.”\nThe numbers don’t quite add up: The U.S. has collected about $250 billion in tariff revenue this year — a bit shy of the \n$2.66 trillion in federal individual income taxes\n in the 2025 fiscal year.\nThe president has promised that tariff revenue will pay down the national debt, now at $38.45 trillion. Over the summer, he told lawmakers that other deals he is striking — some in return for lowering tariffs — would reduce some drug prices by 1,500 percent, a piece of mathematical gymnastics that left some in his audience mystified.\nThe numeric magic continued on Monday, when Mr. Trump said he was using some of those tariff revenues as a “bridge payment,” to tide American farmers over Chinese until purchases resume, a commitment Mr. Trump says he extracted from President Xi Jinping when they met in late October.\nThe repeated use of the word “bridge” by the president and his top economic aides seemed intended to signal to Americans that they just needed to hold on, and the promised benefits from tariff plan would pay off.\n“This money would not be possible without tariffs,” he told a small group of farmers and rice refiners who were brought into the White House for the event. “The tariffs are taking in, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars, and we’re giving some up to the farmers because they were mistreated by other countries, for maybe the right reasons, maybe wrong reasons.”\nHe was skipping by the fac"}

They all chose pickup rather than delivery.\nThe only difference was the price they were offered: $3.99 for a couple of lucky shoppers. $4.59 or $4.69 for others. And a few saw a price of $4.79 — 20 percent more than some others, for the exact same product.\nThe shoppers were volunteers, participating in a \nstudy published on Tuesday\n and organized by the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive policy group, and \nConsumer Reports\n, a nonprofit consumer publication. In tests in four cities across the country, nearly 200 volunteers checked prices on 20 grocery items on Instacart.\nOn item after item, they found significant differences. In a Target in North Canton, Ohio, some shoppers were charged $3.59 for a jar of Skippy peanut butter that others could get for $2.99. At a Safeway in Seattle, some people paid $3.99 for a box of Wheat Thins while others paid $4.89. And at a Target in St. Paul, Minn., some people were charged $4.59 for a box of Cheerios that others could get for $3.99.\n“Two shoppers who are buying the exact same item from the exact same store at the exact same time are getting different prices,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative. “The data really backs up how extraordinarily pervasive this is.”\nAn Instacart spokeswoman said that stores on its platform set their own prices, and that some of them engaged in pricing tests to “learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.”\n“The pricing tests are short term, randomized and designed so that people may see slightly lower prices and some may see slightly higher prices, with the goal of helping retail partners understand consumer preferences and identify categories where they should invest in lower prices,” the spokeswoman said. (Meredith Kopit Levien, president and chief executive of The New York Times Company, is a member of Instacart’s board of directors.)\nA Target spokesman said the company “is not affiliated with Instacart and is not responsible for prices on the Instacart platform.” Instacart said that during the period covered by the Groundwork study, it was “evaluating different approaches” to covering its costs but has since ended pricing tests on Targe"}

Companies are using sophisticated algorithms to adjust prices quickly in response to competitors’ offers and consumer behavior. “Dynamic pricing” strategies, in which companies raise prices during periods of intense demand, have spread beyond sectors where they have become familiar, such as air travel and ride-hailing services, to other parts of the economy, including restaurants and retailers.\n“Prices are definitely more flexible across categories than they were 10 to 15 years ago, and that has to do with the rise of e-commerce and these technologies that have allowed firms over time to react more quickly,” said Alberto Cavallo, a Harvard economist who has documented the rise of algorithm-based pricing strategies. High inflation after the pandemic accelerated the trend, Mr. Cavallo said, by encouraging companies to adjust prices more quickly.\nThese strategies are making prices more volatile and less predictable for consumers, research suggests. And there is some evidence they are pushing up prices, at least in certain categories, at a time when the rising cost of living has emerged as a political point of contention.\nGrocery prices are up more than 25 percent over the past five years and continue to rise faster than before the pandemic. In surveys, voters consistently rank food prices among their top affordability concerns.\nDemocrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have \naccused large food companies of price gouging\n. On Saturday, President Trump signed an \nexecutive order\n creating task forces to investigate possible price-fixing in the food supply chain.\nIn total, the Groundwork study identified price differences on nearly three-quarters of the items tested.

The price tag for the full basket of 20 goods varied by about 7 percent within each store, a difference that could add up to hundreds of dollars over a year of grocery shopping. The organizations conducted smaller-scale tests on several other grocery chains on Instacart and found similar results.\nDianna Dance-Lewis, a volunteer shopper in the study, said she had become frustrated by the rising cost of groceries and by the sense that companies were playing games with prices.\n“Over the last few years, I have just been, as a shopper, just kind of looking at the different signs and online prices when you purchase and just saying, Something’s not right here,” she said.\nSome of the other participants seemed shocked when offered different prices for the same products, said Ms. Dance-Lewis, a middle-school teacher in Virginia. But she said the experience just proved something she already suspected.\n“It confirmed all the craziness that I see,” she said. “It’s so unfair to the consumer.”\nThe Rise of Algorithmic Pricing\nOnline retailers have acknowledged running experiments to test how different prices affect sales. Instacart in 2022 \nacquired Eversight\n, a software company that uses artificial intelligence to help grocery stores and packaged-goods manufacturers set prices.\nIn a call with investors last year, Fidji Simo, Instacart’s chief executive, said the technology “helps retailers dynamically optimize their pricing both online and in-store to really figure out which categories of products a customer is more price sensitive on versus less price sensitive on and really adjust their prices based on that information.”\nThe Groundwork study found no evidence that Instacart was basing different prices on customers’ individual characteristics like income, ZIP code or shopping history. But there is little doubt that Instacart and other online sellers have the ability to do so. Companies including \nDelta Air Lines\n, \nAmazon\n and \nHome Depot\n have been accused of experimenting with such personalized pricing, only to retreat after consumer backlash. (The companies have in most cases denied basing prices on users’ characteristics.)\n“It has happened in the past where the technology is used and then firms realize it’s causing more antagonization and costs to them than the benefit, and then they stop,” Mr. Cavallo said.\nInstacart said that its pricing tests were “never based on personal or behavioral characteristics” and"}

That could make it easier for companies to adopt personalized pricing strategies in the future.\nThe Federal Trade Commission \nsent letters last year to eight companies\n that offer pricing services, demanding information about how they use consumer data. The F.T.C. did not accuse the companies of breaking any laws. In a \npreliminary report\n issued days before Mr. Trump returned to office, the agency’s staff found that “details like a person’s precise location or browser history can be frequently used to target individual consumers with different prices for the same goods and services,” though it did not say how often such strategies were being used in practice.\nAlexander Tolley, another volunteer in the Instacart study, said that even if most companies weren’t using customers’ data to personalize prices yet, he worried that they would soon.\n“If they know how you shop, even on other items, they can use all that information to say, ‘We’re going to tailor the price to you,’” said Mr. Tolley, a 71-year-old retiree in Merced, Calif. “We’re going to get the maximum amount of money out of you that you’re prepared to pay and drain your pocketbook.”\nEfficiency vs. Transparency\nEconomists say variable pricing doesn’t always harm customers. In some cases, the practice may lead to more-efficient outcomes, or even to lower average prices.\nA pizza restaurant that can charge more on game days might charge less on a random Tuesday, for example. And many economists welcome the surge-pricing strategy pioneered by Uber as a way to align supply and demand — by enticing more drivers to show up to an arena where a concert is letting out, for example.\n“Economics would say there are potential welfare benefits from this,” said Alexander"}

And many economists welcome the surge-pricing strategy pioneered by Uber as a way to align supply and demand — by enticing more drivers to show up to an arena where a concert is letting out, for example.\n“Economics would say there are potential welfare benefits from this,” said Alexander MacKay, a University of Virginia economist. He noted that many pricing strategies resulted in higher costs for less price-sensitive — and therefore potentially higher-income — consumers, while lower-income consumers paid less.\nCompanies have long found ways to offer different prices to different customers, said Kevin R. Williams, a Yale economist who has studied pricing practices. Coupons, loyalty programs and senior discounts all allow some customers to pay less. Early-bird specials and happy hours attract customers during otherwise slow periods.\nBut such strategies are transparent and predictable. If different customers start being offered different prices, or prices start changing more frequently, price-sensitive consumers could struggle to ensure they are getting the best deal, Mr. Williams said.\n“Opacity is a business opportunity,” he said.\nNew pricing strategies may also be \ncontributing to inflation\n. In a \npaper published in 2018\n, Mr. Cavallo found that the use of algorithms allowed price shocks — in either direction — to travel more quickly through the economy, leading to more volatility in inflation.\nIn a paper \npublished in July\n, economists at the University of Michigan and University of Virginia argued that algorithms can lead to higher costs for consumers because if companies know that their competitors will almost instantaneously match their prices, they have less incentive to try to attract customers by offering a better deal — a pattern the authors call “algorithmic coercion.”\nEven if just one company in a market is setting its prices algorithmically, “it can raise prices a lot,” said Mr. MacKay of the University of Virginia, who was one of the study’s authors.\nMs. Owens of Groundwork said such studies supported what many consumers already intuitively believed: While companies may say dynamic pricing is a way to improve efficiency, in practice it drives up prices.\n“This isn’t about managing scarcity or efficient markets,” she said. It’s about “pushing to figure out the maximum amount you are willing to pay and squeeze it out of you.”"}

The law also mandates that if the top Republicans or Democrats on the committees were to specifically request such an order, the department would have 30 days to comply, another timeline that the Trump administration has ignored.\nThe new requirements were added during final negotiations to reconcile the two chambers’ versions of the roughly $900 billion defense policy bill, which the House is expected to pass this week. The Senate is expected to approve it next week, sending it to the president’s desk.\nThe bill requires that the videos and other documents be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, meaning they would not be seen by the public, unless later declassified and released.\nBut calls from Democrats for the public release of the video of the Sept. 2 strike are mounting. The opening salvo in the administration’s strikes on traffickers at sea, the early September attack has faced heavy scrutiny partly because of a follow-up strike that killed two survivors.\nWhile Mr. Trump has said he would have “no problem” with the release of the video, Mr. Hegseth over the weekend suggested he would not make it public.\nT"}

But Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus are missing, replaced by a sign reading “ICE WAS HERE” in bold blue letters.\n“The Holy Family is safe in the Sanctuary of our Church,” adds a smaller note inside the Nativity scene, which is protected by a plastic shield. “If you see ICE please call LUCE.” The display includes a phone number for LUCE, an immigrant advocacy group, which tracks the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Massachusetts.\nICE \nbegan a major immigration enforcement campaign\n in the Boston area in September, the forefront of a wave of similar efforts in other major cities.\nSpeaking to reporters late Monday outside the brick church, the Rev.

On the church’s \nFacebook\n page, reaction to the Nativity scene was split. Some commenters thanked the congregation for “speaking truth to power,” while others offered harsh judgments, including one assertion that “the devil has infiltrated the church.”\n“How shameful to make a mockery of Christ’s birth,” one observer wrote.\n“You are on the right side of history,” countered another.\n“I wish I lived close enough to attend this church,” one woman lamented.\nElizabeth Doris-Gustin, 67, a longtime neighbor of the parish who attends an Episcopal church, said she and many of her neighbors look forward to the Christmas displays at St. Susanna every year.\n“You might not agree with everything, but it makes you think,” she said. “I wish a few more churches would be this bold.”\nShe hopes the parish will keep this year’s display, she said. “I’m going to say a little prayer that they keep it up.”"}

She is not yet selling herself.\nOld advisers, both allied and estranged, have squinted from afar at her book tour, wondering what exactly her strategy is, or if there is any at all. She has done little to distance herself from former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. besides admitting aloud that \nit was “recklessness”\n on her part not to have discouraged him from running again. There has been virtually none of the strategic repackaging that a future candidate typically does, the buffing out of flaws and shining up of strengths.\nDefeat hit Ms. Harris deeply. She had not felt such grief since the death of her mother, she has said, a line that sears even as she repeats it so often as to become a talking point. She spent the early months of 2025 cooking and cocooning away from the cameras.\nBut it has been a year since her loss to President Trump, the traditional period of mourning.\nFriends and allies swear she is more relaxed now. She is certainly more relaxed about swearing.\nOn a recent long-form podcast, \nthe likes of which\n she got so much heat for avoiding last year, Ms. Harris let fly a two-word phrase — rhyming with “bucket” — to describe her new ethos. She says she is now on her “freedom tour.”\nThis is Kamala Harris unleashed. But it is still Kamala Harris, the profanity a proxy for plain-spokenness. She is the first woman to serve as vice president, and well attuned to the double standards of gender and race. Lawyerly language remains her safe space, and she still defaults to acting as if every question is part of a deposition where answers can and will be used against her.\nShe has mostly been a bystander in the Democratic Party’s raging debate over its direction. Should Democrats veer to the left or center? More populism? More progressivism? Both? Neither? What exactly should the party stand for?\n“This sounds really corny,” she said in the wide-ranging interview with The New York Times in Nashville. “But we have to stand for the people.

I mean it.”\nThis portrait of the former vice president at a pivot point was reported through interviews with more than two dozen current and past advisers and others close to her, many of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly.\nMs. Harris has made clear she doesn’t “feel burdened” — yes, she still uses \nthat phrase\n — by where she fits in the punditry pecking order or the polls or the cable chyrons. She is enjoying the freedom from what she calls the “transactional” constrictions of campaigning, of asking people for a vote.\nHer place in history is already secure, and she knows it.\n“I understand the focus on ’28 and all that,” she said in the interview. “But there will be a marble bust of me in Congress. I am a historic figure like any vice president of the United States ever was.”\nThe crowd in Nashville was just starting to line up around the block. Big, cheering, adoring. Only two politicians in America have pulled off nationwide tours this year and packed so many venues. One is Bernie Sanders. He is 84, a figure in his final act. The other is Ms. Harris, 61.\nAfter years of being hailed as the future — the \n“female Barack Obama”\n label came as early as 2009, when she was still just a district attorney — Ms. Harris is suddenly at risk of her time having passed.\nYet people aren’t just showing up for her. They’re paying to see her.\n“Thousands of people are coming to hear my voice. Thousands and thousands,” she said. “Every place we’ve gone has been sold out.”\nThe question is what she wants to say.\nCan Harris build back better?\nInside her husband’s Los Angeles golf club in June, Ms. Harris gathered her political brain trust to think through whether she should run for governor of California.\nThere are no shoo-ins in politics. But the path to such a prestigious office is rarely more paved than it was for Ms. Harris at the time.\nHer team made two presentations, according to three people with direct knowledge of the strategy session. Option one was to run for governor.

The book tour spanned 17 cities, three countries and lasted more than half as long as the campaign she was memorializing.\nThe book takes small swipes at potential 2028 rivals: She didn’t consider Pete Buttigieg for vice president because she didn’t believe America was ready for a ticket with a Black woman and a gay man. She was disappointed in Tim Walz’s debate performance. She found parts of Josh Shapiro’s vice-presidential interview off-putting.\nBut the dishiest details are her private feelings about and frustrations with Mr. Biden.\n“I’m not going to talk about my conversations with him,” she said in the interview when asked about any post-book fallout with the former president. She interrupted a follow-up question: “I’m sure it’s on your list,” she said with her familiar laugh.\n \n“\nYou can check that you did.”\nOnstage in Nashville, she was asked, basically, if Mr. Biden had done her dirty. If he had doomed her by dropping out so late and privately urging her not to distance herself from him.\nHer answer began with “I think there are many variables that were at play” and eventually landed on “perhaps.”\nThe circumstances of Ms. Harris’s loss meant that many sympathetic Democrats blamed Mr. Biden.\nYet in the year since, she has not capitalized on that good will. She has let others lead the fight against Mr. Trump, and has slipped in the way-too-early 2028 primary polls. One \npre-Thanksgiving survey\n in New Hampshire placed her in the single digits, in a distant third place.\nMs. Harris does not fear losing to other Democrats if she runs again, one person close to her said. She is unconcerned about potential rivals seizing the spotlight because she is already so well known, another added. She believes she has more time than anyone to decide about 2028, said a third.\nBehind the scenes, Ms. Harris has been re-engaging.\nHer team has formed a political action committee called Fight for the People, and she has reached a deal with the Democratic National Committee to pay roughly $7 million for her email list, two people briefed on the arrangement said.

A first payment has been made. She plans to ramp up her political activity in 2026.\nShe called Zohran Mamdani, the incoming mayor of New York City, the day after he won, offering advice on how to hire his staff and serve as an executive.\n“I do not think he’s a scary face for the Democratic Party,” she said of Mr. Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, praising the excitement he has generated from younger voters.\nShe also called the moderate Democratic women who won governorships, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey. All told, Ms. Harris made more than 40 congratulatory calls after the election — to new state senators in Mississippi, incoming city council members in South Carolina and even a school board trustee in Idaho.\nIt was among the most calls to other elected officials she had made so quickly \nsince Mr. Biden dropped out\n. And it was exactly the kind of thing that a person planning to run for president might do.\nWhat kind of change does she believe in?\nThe elevator pitch of Ms. Harris’s ideology remains as elusive as ever.\nIn public and in private, she has been exploring issues of trust, misinformation, social media, community and artificial intelligence. She is particularly obsessed with young people and their growing disillusionment, which she shares.\n“For now, I don’t want to go back in the system,” she \ntold Stephen Colbert\n in her first interview about her book. “I think it’s broken.”\nIt was a striking statement from a politician who spent her career inside government, a Black woman who had to persuade her family of the value of working in a prosecutor’s office, of making change from within. But what she sees as the “capitulation” of American institutions to Mr. Trump — law firms, universities, the news media — has shaken her confidence in the old order.\nNow she faces a crossroads — between her instincts as an incrementalist insider and the present demands of so many for transformational thinking.\nThe mission statement of her new nonprofit group, KDH for the People, is so broad as to be unobjectionable to almost anyone: “To strengthen communities across America through the promotion of economic opportunity, justice and protection of fund"}

The challenge for her is to present her own case,” said Jamal Simmons, who served as Ms. Harris’s communications director for a year of her vice presidency. “I think Kamala Harris needs to be very clear with herself about what she is willing to expose — and advocate for — and how much of herself she is willing to put onto the altar of public examination.”\nIn her book, she laments her botched appearance on ABC’s “The View” in 2024, when she said that “nothing comes to mind” about what she would have done differently from Mr. Biden. Yet even in the recent interview with The Times, the first mistakes she cited were more strategic than substantive.\nShe said she would have rearranged the order of the administration’s priorities, focusing first on extending child tax credits and paid family leave. Pressed for an actual misstep, she added not doing more to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel for how he was waging the Gaza war “as it related to innocent Palestinians.”\nShe is focused on affordability now, and praised the recent shutdown strategy to fight for health care subsidies.\nThe day after it ended, Ms. Harris called Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who is the party’s most endangered incumbent and had opposed the vote to reopen, to offer her support in any way he needed, according to two people who described the call.\nBut in the interview, Ms. Harris declined to say anything about the moderate Democrats who ended the shutdown — “I’m not going to engage in a circular firing squad” — or about Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, whose place in the party is \nunder increasing pressure\n.\n“We need to focus on where we are now and moving forward,” she said.\n‘She raises money and she excites crowds’\nMs. Harris did not hesitate when the actress Sophia Bush asked her at a recent event what, in hindsight, she would write on a Post-it note to herself on the first day of her 2024 campaign.\n“Get more days,” she said.\nBut it is not apparent whether more tim"}

But her candidacy lost steam in the long interludes in between. She similarly rocketed out of the gate in her 2020 presidential primary run with \na splashy kickoff\n and a \nscorching first debate\n. She dropped out before a single vote was cast.\n“As a political athlete, Vice President Harris excels and performs at her best when there’s urgency,” said Herbie Ziskend, who served as an adviser to Ms. Harris while she was vice president.\nPlenty of Democrats now see her as a symbol of a painful past. Her defeat after raising and spending \n$1.5 billion in 15 weeks\n left a particularly sour taste for major donors.\nMs. Harris still has enviable political assets, including passionate support from two core Democratic constituencies: Black voters and women. As she walked last month through Fisk University, a historically Black college in Nashville, young Black women literally leaped for joy.\nBlack voters, particularly in the South, have swung the party’s last two open presidential nominating contests. Ms. Harris has made a point of traveling through the South on her book tour. Her stop in Birmingham, Ala., was so popular that the venue \nadded a second event\n.\n“That’s what so many of the white boys — the Josh Shapiros, the Gavin Newsoms of the world and even Pete, although I would vote for Pete — that’s what they miss about Kamala,” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina legislator who has been an informal Harris adviser, referring to the governors of Pennsylvania and California and to Mr. Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary. “She is so important to so many people.”\nAt the Ryman, Ms. Harris drew one of her loudest ovations when she knowingly described a future president as “whoever she may be.”\nMichelle Obama, the former first lady, \nrecently cast doubt\n on the country’s willingness to elect a woman as president. Ms. Harris does not have such reservations. “I do believe the country is ready,” she said.\nMinyon Moore, a close Harris confidante who is a senior D.N.C. member, said Ms. Harris’s future in the party could be whatever she wanted.\n“There are"}

And I would add a third. She has a love and passion for this country.”\nA ‘very talented’ California rival\nMs. Harris’s career has risen in tandem and in tension with Gov. Gavin Newsom of California ever since they were sworn into office in San Francisco on the same day two decades ago.\nTheir relationship is complex, to say the least. In her book, she needled him by revealing that he never returned her call the day Mr. Biden dropped out. “Hiking. Will call back,” he texted.\n(Incidentally, Mr. Newsom \nsaid on a podcast at the time\n that he had been on a treadmill; an aide clarified that he was initially on a treadmill and later went on a hike.)\nMr. Newsom has questioned why the episode was included, given that he endorsed her so quickly. He texted Ms. Harris to ask her this after her book came out, \nhe recounted recently to a video game streamer\n.\nHe said she had a pithy reply of her own: “On book tour. Get back to you later.”\n“Anyway,” Mr. Newsom said with a laugh, “that’s the relationship.”\nRepresentatives for both declined to comment on the texts.\nHe did not give a speech at her convention — logistics was the excuse — and this year it can be hard not to hear his critiques of the party’s failures as swipes at her, even if he doesn’t quite say so. “We got our asses kicked and it wasn’t just Kamala — she had, there was difficult circumstances for anybody,” he told the streamer.\nThe Newsom and Harris circles of advisers have always overlapped. But Mr. Newsom has now subsumed Ms. Harris’s former network to a startling degree.\nHer former chief of staff is now his. Her former chief consulting firm is now his. Her former campaign manager ran Mr. Newsom’s \nredistricting ballot measure campaign\n.\nMeanwhile, her political orbit is still shrinking: Sheila Nix, currently her top adviser, is leaving at the end of the year.

I really do. And I think we have many talented people.”\nA new way forward?\nMs. Harris’s book is certainly selling.\nHer publisher said it had sold more than 600,000 copies across all formats, making it the best-selling memoir published this year.\nThe book was the animating force of Ms. Harris’s political life in 2025. Now the rollout is over, though more events are planned next spring in Phoenix, Denver and California.\nSo what’s next?\nThe midterms loom, along with the question of how much and where she will campaign after a \nmostly quiet\n 2025.\nMs. Harris said one of the best parts of not running for office had been listening to people instead of talking at them. Her nonprofit group has been organizing closed-door listening sessions.\n“I can’t be relevant if I don’t have a sense of where people are,” she explained after meeting with some younger male gig musicians.\nThe trip was her first to Tennessee since early 2023, when she raced to arrive the day after the State House \nexpelled two young Black Democrats\n for a gun-control protest.\nThat forceful visit was seen by many Democrats as a key moment in finding her voice.\nMs. Harris, however, has a correction to that timeline.\n“You tell them,” she said, “I never lost my voice.”"}

Yet these worlds do contain value. Each of these games bears a specificity that draws from contexts both present and past, showing us novel ways of looking at both.\nComing-of-age narratives showed up in a big way this year, exploring the messy moment of a new world’s birth. Other games use the potent tool of nostalgia to provide a brief respite. And mystery games have had a mighty resurgence, with several detective stories having their protagonists put an opaque and incomprehensible narrative back together in a way that makes sense.\nIt’s little wonder that such games would hold appeal right now.\nArtis Impact\nThe beautifully rendered pixel art world was made, along with every other part of this role-playing game, by a single Malaysian developer. It follows the abbreviated journey of a magical girl hero and her sardonic robot sidekick through a dystopian landscape wrecked by a war between humans and bestial “AI” who roar in distorted static before they are struck down by balletic sword strikes. She also cooks herbal soup, takes naps and sweeps the floors of her neighborhood corner store.\nA brash, sketchy approach, using comic book cells and snappy animation for more dialogue-heavy moments, allows Artis Impact to be bold in its storytelling. It can evoke grand ideas like alienation and despair for the future, and in the next beat fire off joke-a-minute dialogue poking fun at itself and the role-playing genres it is riffing on. \n(PC)\nBaby Steps\nThis is a video game about the absurdity of video games. Most make it feel sublimely easy to run a little character around a three-dimensional world. \nBaby Steps forces players to stop\n and question this basic assumption. Every step you take is painful and deliberate, as you control each leg separately and must maneuver them in such a way that your character doesn’t trip or stumble.\nNo matter how carefully you play, your avatar will fall countless times, in comically painful-looking ways. The others you meet along the way — sneering would-be guides, alpha-male donkey men with giant dangling members — paint a world of distorted, vicious masculinity that pokes fun at the classic video game power fantasy. \n(PC, PlayStation 5)\nConsume Me\nThough it’s ostensibly a game about dieting, Consume Me quickl"}

Using an inventive roster of interactions like mealtime Tetris, folding laundry and stretching a gangly figure into various positions as “exercise,” the game shows the character progressing through the final years of high school and into college, struggling all the while to balance the pressures placed on her by parents, school, crushes and, most powerfully of all, herself.\nAnother autobiographical story, Despelote\n focuses on the years surrounding Ecuador’s unlikely entry into the 2002 World Cup and is presented through the first-person perspective of a young boy obsessed, like everyone else in his city, with soccer. Its dithered halftone art style casts everything in a dreamlike haze, perfectly fitting the game’s narrative framing: a half-remembered dream of a childhood that may or may not have happened.\nWithin this dream, your character fights with his sister over TV time, plays soccer in the streets with friends and gets dressed down by his aggrieved mother.

It’s just as frantic, cool and engaging to play as young Melinoë as it was to control Zagreus.\nThe sequel deepens the systems of the first, as Melinoë’s style requires a bit more strategy. She’s a witch, after all, and uses magic, mostly, to dispatch enemies, trapping them in her wards and sending out dazzling bolts of energy. This shift in gameplay aligns with a heightened sympathy for a character, who, unlike the rebellious Zagreus, must work her way back into the underworld, to a family she lost before ever really knowing. \n(PC, Switch, Switch 2)\nKeep Driving\nThis is a nostalgia-fueled-road-trip simulator, a staring-at-the-clouds simulator and a scarfing-up-the-last-bite-of-pizza simulator, all at once.\nKeep Driving’s charm is in its systemization of vibes\n.

He eventually began feeling excruciating pain and discomfort in his genitalia. At times his legs became numb, and he lost the ability to walk. A judge ordered his release in September, agreeing with his lawyers that he had “a sufficiently serious medical condition” to be let out. In his decision, the judge chronicled the graphic details of what Mr. Muñoz Materano had gone through, saying that that ICE officials had acted “with deliberate indifference” toward his medical needs.\nAcross the United States, several other judges have also criticized conditions at federal immigration detention centers or released migrants who lacked access to adequate medical care.\nIn August, \na federal judge directed the Trump administration\n to fix what detainees have called squalid and overcrowded conditions inside migrant holding cells in New York City. In October, a judge in Detroit ordered that a Michigan man who had leukemia be released from custody or at least be given a bond hearing in immigration court as he faced the prospect of deportation. And in November, a judge in Chicago imposed restrictions on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that he said had subjected migrants to “\nconditions that are unnecessarily cruel\n.”\nTheir actions highlight tension over what migrants and human rights advocates have denounced as inhumane treatment by the Trump administration. ICE officials have denied mistreating detainees.\nThe case of Mr. Muñoz Materano offers an especially telling example of the neglect cited by judges. The skin on his legs became itchy, and his genitalia began to swell, according to court records. He felt a burning sensation when he urinated. The apparent infection also seemed to spread to his face. Later, when he could not walk, he was given a wheelchair.\nWhile in detention, he had nearly two dozen medical appointments with nurses and physician assistants who prescribed medication, according to federal immigration officials.

But U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos wrote in his Sept. 9 decision that “as a result of the frequent, haphazard transfers to which he was subjected,” Mr. Muñoz Materano was not allowed to consistently take the medicine, and his symptoms worsened.\nIn an interview, Mr. Muñoz Materano said that he pleaded for the medicine, including an antifungal and antibiotic. He said he explained to prison officials that he was in pain, but he was told that ICE had not authorized them to give him the medicine.\n“I would tell them, from the heart, that it hurt,” Mr. Muñoz Materano said in Spanish. “That I was sick.”\nAndrew Free, a former immigration and civil rights lawyer who researches conditions and deaths in ICE custody, said that before this year, immigration officials were more likely to release detainees if their continued incarceration could put them in peril, such as at the \nheight of the coronavirus pandemic\n.\nBut Mr. Free said that as President Trump has expanded his crackdown on legal and illegal immigration, the government has imposed a harder line.\nMr. Muñoz Materano’s lawyers brought his case before Judge Ramos to argue that his detention was unlawful because it violated his due process as someone living lawfully in the country. They also argued that his incarceration later endangered his health.\nIn an email, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, rejected criticism regarding the agency’s treatment of detainees. She said that Mr. Muñoz Materano was given comprehensive medical care, receiving at least 23 medical appointments and intake screenings within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility. Ms. McLaughlin did not address complaints from Mr. Muñoz Materano that he was deprived of access to a bath and clean clothes.\n“This is the best health care many aliens have received in their entire lives,” Ms. McLaughlin said.\nShe referred to Judge Ramos as a “lone activist judge” and said that “smears like these” have led to an increase in assaults against ICE officers.\nMr. Muñoz Materano’s legal team retained the services of Dr. Kate S.

Sugarman, a family medicine doctor in Washington who evaluated Mr. Muñoz Materano’s medical records and found symptoms of a fungal skin infection. Separately, she said the records showed that a lump in his testicles could be a sign of testicular torsion or of cancer.\n“When a man has a mass in his testicles, it’s an emergency to make sure that that mass is not cancer,” Dr. Sugarman said. “Any delay in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer means that the cancer can spread and then the patient can die.”\nDr. Sugarman expressed concern that Mr. Muñoz Materano had not been “referred to a urologist or oncologist, nor received diagnostic imaging or a biopsy,” and she said that his medical records “do not indicate appropriate referrals, imaging, testing or follow-up care.” She said that immigration officials had displayed a lack of urgency about the serious decline in his health and had risked his death, calling their behavior “inexcusable.”\nSince he was freed on Sept. 9 and taken to an emergency room at a New York hospital, medical officials have not diagnosed his condition. He lost his job and has struggled to find work and housing because of his pain. His lawyer, Rosanna Eugenio, said that he lost health insurance as a result of his detention. Ms. Eugenio said that he is working with his legal team to enter a program that can help him receive comprehensive care.\nMr. Muñoz Materano’s journey to the United States began after his family in Venezuela was targeted by Tren de Aragua gang members who invaded their home and threatened to kill them at gunpoint, according to the judge’s ruling in his case. He entered the United States through El Paso about two years ago by applying for a government program created by the Biden administration that allowed migrants to use an app to secure an appointment for admission.\nHe was granted humanitarian parole and given a work permit, which led to a job as a warehouse worker in Brooklyn. But on May 21, when he went to a scheduled asylum hearing at an immigration court in New York City, four people in plainclothes with no identification or badges rushed toward him, handcuffed him and took him to a van. They then took him to 26 Federal Plaza, the New York City headquarters of ICE, which has become synonymous with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.\nIn his ruling, Judge Ramos noted that Mr. Muñoz Materano had been “living and lawfull"}

He stood up and sat down again as he struggled to find a comfortable position.\n“I tried to follow the laws of the United States, and I was treated like a criminal,” Mr. Muñoz Materano said. “Many other people are going through the same thing that I am.”\nCivil rights groups have raised concerns about at least two of the eight detention centers that Mr. Muñoz Materano was taken to: the Orange County Jail in Goshen, N.Y., and the \nEl Paso Service Processing Center\n in Texas.\nHe was also taken to facilities in Louisiana and New Jersey.\nIn October, \nNew York Lawyers for the Public Interest released a report\n about the Orange County Jail that delineated a lack of care for people with chronic conditions and issues with medication.

Tensions spilled over again on Monday, when Thailand launched airstrikes on Cambodia.

At least 40 people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced.\nAfter the cease-fire, the two countries continued to trade accusations.\nIn November, undermining Mr. Trump’s efforts to \ncast himself as a global peacemaker\n, Thailand \npulled out of peace talks\n with Cambodia after two Thai soldiers were injured by a land mine in a disputed border area.\nIn a \nstatement\n on Monday, Mr. Anwar said that “our region cannot afford to see longstanding disputes slip into cycles of confrontation.”\nWhy are Thailand and Cambodia fighting?\nThe conflict between Thailand and Cambodia is driven by nationalist rivalries and \nlong-running\n border disputes, and fighting has broken out intermittently since \n2008\n. Before the clashes in July, the last time that a major incident \nturned deadly was in 2011\n.\nMuch of the conflict comes down to disagreements over the nearly 500-mile-long boundary between the two nations, large parts of which are undefined.\nThose disagreements can be traced to a 1907 map that was created during French colonial rule and that Thailand and Cambodia interpret differently. Some of the most tense areas along the border are home to centuries-old temples.\nArguments about where the border should be, and who owns the temples in the region, have led to decades of friction.\nPrasat Preah Vihear and Prasat Ta Muen Thom, both \nKhmer-era Hindu temples\n about 95 miles apart, are two of the key sites where tensions flared in July. On Monday, the Thai army said that one of its airstrikes had struck a radio tower near the Preah Vihear temple.\nIs it safe to travel to Thailand and Cambodia?\nOn Monday, the \nU.S. Embassy in Thailand\n and the \nU.S. Embassy in Cambodia\n both urged Americans to avoid traveling within 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) of the Thai-Cambodia border. The embassies both said in \nstatements\n that they were monitoring reports of a “significant escalation” in the fighting and that the situation remains “volatile.”"}

The werewolf, played by Chow, shows up two seconds in and sinks his teeth into a hapless jock’s neck as his terrified classmates tumble out of their desks. A young woman screams, and we realize it is a dream sequence. The episode, published in late June, has been viewed more than 23 million times.\nThose 18 seconds took Chow and his team four hours to nail, shooting take after take at his 10,000-square-foot production studio until they got the movement of the airplanes just right and the students falling to the ground with the proper thud.\n“Most important scene of our episode!” Chow called out to start the shoot day. He knows that the 10-year-olds watching have other distractions and is determined to hold their attention: “The video clicks open, it’s explosive and then go, go,” he said later in an interview. But his audience also wants “story-driven video,” he added, filled with “emotion and moments and beauty.”\nIt can be hard to accomplish all of that. But more than a vast majority of people making videos on YouTube, Chow, 29, is among the 1 percent of the 1 percent, like \nMrBeast\n and \nMs. Rachel\n, who have figured out something that is working. His videos are viewed one billion to 1.5 billion times a month on average. “Alan’s Universe” has 98.3 million subscribers — 35 million more than Taylor Swift — and this year became available on Prime Video and the Roku Channel. Chow is starting a pop group and has announced a partnership with the Korean skin-care brand Laneige. In July, he was named to Time’s list of 100 influential creators, alongside people like \nJoe Rogan\n, \nAlex Cooper\n and \nKai Cenat\n.\n“It’s 100 percent my intention to build this franchise,” Chow said, “into the next Disney.”\nTo do that, he will have to expand beyond YouTube, but he cannot ignore it, either, and that is the challenge for many content creators looking to level up.\nA show made for Gen Alpha\nChow was born and raised in Plano, Texas, the son of a NASA engineer and a preschool owner, and grew up on a diet of “Family Matters,” “Hannah Montana,” “That’s So Raven” and other squeaky-clean sitcoms.\nWhen he went off to college at the University of Southern Ca"}

So he started making videos\n \nthat could make his mother laugh.\nAt U.S.C., he joined a club for students interested in becoming creators. He learned about the business of social media and that “you can actually \nmake\n viral videos.”\nThe recipe is not really a secret: Hook viewers with a strong title and thumbnail image, keep them for the critical first few seconds, make sure a broad audience finds it relatable.\n“It’s the difference between doing a video that’s really niche — ‘I spent 50 hours in Buc-ee’s,’ which is a gas station in Texas, which I know because I grew up in Texas — and ‘My Boyfriend Is a Werewolf?!’” Chow said. “Everybody knows what werewolves are and everyone is curious to see, ‘Oh, what is this concept going to be?’”\nSome content creators attempt to tailor material to TikTok, Instagram and any other potentially profitable platform. But by 2020, Chow, aware that \nthe Trump administration might ban TikTok\n, had also read the book “Essentialism,” whose message he summarized as “you can be good at many things or you can the best at one thing.” He threw himself into YouTube, specifically YouTube Shorts, videos often under a minute that are designed to be watched on phones.\nThose early videos, which he eventually tapped Chelsea Sik, a U.S.C. classmate, to help him make, encapsulate some of Chow’s beliefs about what is effective. They are positive and high energy, built around wholesome themes. (“It doesn’t matter if you’re human or werewolf,” Sik’s character says in the werewolf episode. “Protecting each other is what makes us family.”) His YouTube Shorts videos often have little dialogue, making them accessible and language-agnostic.\nBut Chow knew that life lessons were difficult to impart in 60 seconds. So with Sik and some other friends, he made \na five-minute episode\n, a sort of pilot for “Alan’s Universe.” It became the highest-performing video on the channel.\n“I tried all these different things and I realized that because people watch this on Shorts all the time, they probably wanted this on long form,” he said.

Sik is now its lead actress.\nThe audience is heavily Generation Alpha, children roughly 7 to 14 who grew up with screens. His work is not so different from the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon shows that Chow and his cast mates came of age with.\n“This show is for the children that are in middle school,” said Moris Zingman, 27, a lead producer on “Alan’s Universe,” “and this is their illusion of what high school looks like.”\n‘You have to keep increasing the stakes’\nElements of “Alan’s Universe” splash across \nTikTok\n and \nInstagram\n, but it is YouTube, the No. 1 streaming platform, that powered its rise.\n“Someone like Alan is defining what media and entertainment are for a new generation, both here and globally\n,” \nsaid Angela Courtin, a vice president of marketing at YouTube. Like many of the platform’s successes, Chow has formed a connection with his audience and responds to fans’ feedback, key parts of the “secret sauce for YouTube,” she said.\nBut being powered by YouTube also requires keeping up with its changing demands. People are watching longer videos, \nincreasingly on their televisions\n, which has prompted Chow and other creators to create more episodic content. The change raises new creative hurdles.\n“You have to keep increasing the stakes for 30 minutes, which is so much more difficult,” he said.\nAmong creators, the change in how people consume YouTube content and the move to a bigger screen has become a line of demarcation. Chow said he saw himself as part of a new wave of creators whose rise had been powered by this shift.\nMichelle Khare, whose YouTube channel has more than five million YouTube subscribers, is also part of it. She previously made \nseven-minute videos\n about trying new Starbucks drinks but is now more likely to release \na 47-minute episode of samurai training\n for her docuseries, “Challenge Accepted.”\nKhare has a staff of six who work with dozens of freelancers.

She called the operation “a modern production company,” noting that her team goes though development, production, post syndication and dubbing just like a traditional TV show. But creators like her are nimble and can adjust to audience feedback on the fly, she added.\nConsider her recent video “\nI Tried Tom Cruise’s Deadliest Stunt\n.” To Khare’s surprise, the audience was invested in a segment that involved her getting protective scleral contact lenses put in.\n“I thought they were going to want to see the physical training, the grit and the sweat,” she said. “But they were actually really interested in the technical component of the stunt. So for the very next episode that we’re releasing, I want to make sure that we have just as much focus on how we’re pulling it off as we do on my personal individual preparation.”\nMaking such cinematic content quickly gets expensive.\nChow discovered too late that although he could afford to rent a Burbank studio, he could not initially afford to build the sets he needed inside it.\nEach time he made a change to scale up “felt like I had destroyed my life,” he said. And you do not get paid for videos you have not yet made, Chow added. So even now, he considers every video the team puts out to be “a big bet.”\nThe show makes money through advertising on the content, through campaigns like the new one with Laneige, as well as merchandise sales. Chow declined to say how much revenue his enterprise brings in.\nA handful of YouTube personalities have struck lucrative deals. \nPuck reported\n this summer that MrBeast sold multiple seasons of his competition show to Amazon for almost $300 million. Netflix has already \nbrought on Ms. Rachel\n. And this fall, \na Dude Perfect documentary\n put the group of creators and their elaborate sports stunts in theaters nationwide.\nNow, top creators like Chow have become less concerned about divining the secret sauce than a new challenge: How do YouTube’s stars maintain their popularity and grow it beyond the platform that has served them so well?\n“YouTube is still our No. 1 priority,” Chow said.\nBut it has also become clear that fans want more than just videos.

When Chow and his castmates performed at the creator festival VidCon, he realized it was time to get into music. Any efforts to expand beyond YouTube, he said, “really comes from the fans and how to serve them better.”\n‘We get an idea and we shoot it’\nPutting out even two episodes of “Alan’s Universe” a month requires 12-hour days, and by Hollywood standards, team members say, that is efficient.\n“Things move a lot faster here,” said Laith Souqi, a line producer. “We have the standing sets and we have an inventory of props. So we get an idea and we shoot it.”\nA trip to the “Alan’s Universe” studio reveals an industrious if unconventional group working in a still-evolving space. The prop department amounts to a tower of half-open Amazon boxes. Craft services equates to Chipotle. At a moment when traditional \nHollywood is leaving Los Angeles\n, Alan and his team have put down roots.\nOn the day I visited, Chow watched recordings of his opening step-and-growl. He reshot it several times, worried he was not all that scary. Hours later, Chow — still in werewolf makeup — huddled with his creative team and decided to cut a battle scene; his audience might not like the twinge of violence, he reasoned, and, well, the scene was feeling a little long.\nWriting and acting in the episodes has never been Chow’s biggest concern — he is trained in those disciplines, and he has help. It is the management role that he is still growing into.\n“I always kind of thought, ‘OK, it’s just going to be me and a camera and maybe an editor,’” he said. But as “Alan’s Universe” has grown, he added, “I think I have just adjusted and said, ‘OK then, we have to turn up in this way in order to make this decision become the right decision.’”"}

A major exhibition re-created his designs in a large plastic installation. Subway carriages were painted with his designs. Even a trendy restaurant joined in, offering a Malevich-themed menu that featured a salty cake served on a painter’s palette dotted with butter blobs. To spread the butter, you had to use a brush.\nIn a country that has strived to \nshake off Russian cultural influences\n, celebrating Malevich — an artist known around the world as Russian — might have seemed odd.\nBut Malevich was born and raised in Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, and though he built his career in Moscow, he maintained strong ties with his homeland. So for Ukrainians, it was a chance to reclaim an artist long absent from their cultural narrative.\nIt’s a battle Ukraine believes is worth fighting. By taking ownership of a name recognized around the world, Kyiv wants to assert Ukraine’s cultural weight and give its allies another reason to support it after nearly four years of war.\nMalevich is best known as the founder of Suprematism, an abstract art movement that prioritized geometric shapes and pure colors over realistic representation. His works changed the course of art, influencing genres like Dadaism and Surrealism, and inspiring generations of artists, including \nPiet Mondrian\n and \nMark Rothko\n.\n“What Ukraine really needs now is to fight for people’s attention,” said Yaroslava Gres, founder of \nUkraine WOW, an agency promoting Ukrainian culture\n that organized the Kyiv exhibition.\nShe added, “Explaining our culture and our connection with the world, showing our best pieces of art, is far more effective in getting people to know Ukraine, to love Ukraine.”\nMalevich, born in 1879 in Kyiv to a Polish family, grew up in Ukrainian villages, where his father managed sugar factories, and later moved to Russia to pursue an artistic career. His identity straddles Ukraine, Russia and Poland — typical of an era when all three countries were part of the same empire.\nFor decades, however, the world knew only Malevich’s Russian side, a reflection of Moscow’s long cultural dominance, scholars say.

Russia was where he honed his art and exhibited his works, including “Black Square,” which was first shown in 1915.\nBut it was also in Soviet Russia that Malevich faced repression during Stalin’s crackdown on intellectual circles, making it impossible to display his abstract art in his final years.\nFew knew that Malevich spoke Ukrainian growing up, that he first studied art in Kyiv under the prominent \nUkrainian painter Mykola Pymonenko\n or that he returned to Ukraine in the late 1920s to teach at the Kyiv Art Institute. Malevich identified himself as Ukrainian in his diaries.\nTetyana Filevska, an art historian and Malevich specialist, said she first learned of the artist’s Ukrainian roots in the mid-2000s, while working on a project with Polish art experts. “I had no idea he had any connection to Ukraine,” she said. “No one in Ukraine actually spoke about it.”\nThe discovery sent her digging deeper. She organized tours of Kyiv to show where Malevich had lived and studied, and gave lectures about how Ukrainian peasant life had inspired his art. In 2015, after one such lecture, a woman approached her and introduced herself as the daughter of Malevich’s former assistant at the Kyiv Art Institute. She had a treasure at home: dozens of pages of articles and notes written by the artist that had never been studied.\nMs. Filevska turned the archives into a book, \n“Kazimir Malevich. Kyiv Period 1928-1930,”\n which she said helped convince scholars who had long been skeptical of the artist’s Ukrainian roots. A few years later, \na documentary\n brought her research to a wider audience.\nMs. Filevska said it would be wrong to relabel Malevich solely as Ukrainian. “We cannot take him out of the Russian context,” she said.\nBut, she added, she would like Malevich’s Ukrainian identity to be recognized — starting in Ukraine itself.\nThough Ukraine became independent in 1991, the country’s cultural scene long remained shaped by Russia. Music, TV shows and books were mostly Russian. So was Malevich.\n“We grew up with the feeling that he was Russian,” said Maria Prus, a marketing researcher. “We grew up with the feeling that Ukrainian culture is something small, while Russian culture is something big.”\nMs. Prus, 31, was visiting the exhibition organized by the Ukraine WOW agency, which highlights Ukraine’s cul"}

Her boyfriend, Eugene Kokomoiets, who visited with her, was just as surprised. “This is embarrassing for us,” he said with an awkward smile.\nThe exhibition is part of a broader effort to make Malevich a familiar figure for Ukrainians.\nSilpo, a Ukrainian supermarket chain, recently \nrepackaged a range\n of its specialty items, including honey pots, with Malevich-inspired designs, aiming to restore the artist “to the Ukrainian context.” A new \ncosmetics brand named Malevich\n sells beauty creams and lipsticks in red, blue and yellow packages — primary colors dear to the artist.\n“If people every morning treat their skin with Malevich cosmetics, they’ll start to remember him,” said Kateryna Krykun, the brand’s founder.\nThe \nMalevich biopic\n serves a similar purpose. This fall, viewers exiting a showing said that they had a renewed sense of pride. “It’s about who we are and how important our culture actually is,” said Mariia Stretovych, 35, who, despite living on a street in Kyiv named after Malevich, acknowledged that she had long overlooked his story.\nMs. Filevska, the art historian, helped produce the movie. She said that one of the goals was to infuse Ukraine’s fight for freedom with a deeper sense of identity. “The more we understand who we are, the more we fight back,” she said.\nUkraine now hopes the wider world, too, will see this cultural heritage as one more reason to support the embattled country.\nSince the war broke out in 2022, Ukraine has ramped up its cultural diplomacy, opening institutes in \nGermany\n, \nFrance\n and \nthe Netherlands\n.

I’ll be frank.”\nMr. Zelensky made the comments in an online chat with journalists after meeting in London with leaders of Europe’s largest economies, who vowed to continue backing Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression.\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain hosted Mr. Zelensky at 10 Downing Street, along with President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, for a closed-door discussion.\nIn brief remarks before the meeting began, Mr. Zelensky said he was there to discuss “sensitive issues” and stressed that it was critical for Europeans and Americans to unite with Ukraine in defending the country against Russia and in negotiating an end to the conflict.\n“There are some things we can’t manage without Americans; things which we can’t manage without Europe,” he said. “That’s why we need to make some important decisions.”\nAfter the meeting ended, Mr. Macron’s office issued a statement saying the group had worked on the American peace proposals “with a view to supplementing it with European contributions, in close coordination with Ukraine.”\nThe statement added that “in parallel, work will be stepped up to provide Ukraine with robust security guarantees and to plan measures for the reconstruction of Ukraine.”\nThe Europeans repeated their longstanding pledges of robust support for Ukraine, both on and off the battlefield.

But he said, “We have to talk about that. That’s why we are here.”\nThe trio of European leaders were hoping to bolster Mr. Zelensky’s negotiating position in the face of what they view as unacceptable demands by President Vladimir V.

Mr. Putin said last week that parts of the American proposal to end the war were \nnot workable\n. Mr. Zelensky said in a \nsocial media post\n on Saturday that he was “determined to keep working” on reaching a peace deal.\n“Our approach is that everything must be workable — every crucial measure for peace, security, and reconstruction,” Mr. Zelensky wrote.\nTo achieve those goals, he has been looking to the European leaders, who have in recent weeks expressed frustration about \nbeing cut out of negotiations\n by Mr. Trump and his team.\nThose \ndiplomatic tensions with Europe\n were on vivid display last week when the Trump administration unveiled an annual update to the United States’ national security strategy that criticized Europe’s handling of the conflict in Ukraine.\nThe Trump administration “finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition,” the strategy said.\nEuropean officials reacted with alarm to the document over the weekend, saying it further signaled an American retreat from Europe under Mr. Trump’s leadership.\nBy contrast, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, praised the new national security strategy on Monday.\n“The nuances we see in the new strategy, we like it, without a doubt,” he told journalists on his daily briefing phone call. “There it speaks about the importance of dialogue and building constructive relations, and this is absolutely in line with our vision.”\nSégolène Le Stradic contributed reporting from Paris, Kim Barker from Kyiv and Valerie Hopkins from Berlin."}

But, he added, “This is the first time the archdiocese has shown willingness to engage in any kind of process to bring all of this toward resolution.”\n“Any time the church shows a willingness to engage in serious negotiation, all of us who represent survivors are eager to work together toward that end,” he said. “We are hopeful that we can and that we will.”\nIt was not clear that the two parties would agree to $300 million as the size of the settlement; the final number to be paid to accusers could be higher or lower.\nThe announcement of the mediation was made in a letter published on Monday by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who said that archdiocese officials had met in recent weeks with lawyers to discuss the contours of a global settlement between the church and its accusers.\n“As we have repeatedly acknowledged, the sexual abuse of minors long ago has brought shame upon our church,” the cardinal wrote in an email to roughly 300,000 Catholics across New York. “I once again ask forgiveness for the failing of those who betrayed the trust placed in them by failing to provide for the safety of our young people.”\nCardinal Dolan said both the archdiocese and representatives of its accusers had agreed to enlist Daniel J. Buckley, a retired judge from California, as a neutral mediator.\nJudge Buckley previously helped negotiate a similar settlement between the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and more than 1,000 people who had accused its personnel of abuse, the cardinal said.\nThe announcement in New York came on the same day that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans said it would pay at least $230 million to hundreds of abuse survivors as part of a n"}

He delivered the opening prayer at President Trump’s inauguration in January.\nBut the archdiocese has struggled to respond to the roughly 1,700 sexual abuse claims that have been filed since the State Legislature passed the Child Victims Act in 2019 and the Adult Survivors Act in 2022.\nBoth laws created “look-back windows” that allowed people to file civil claims for sexual abuse even if the statute of limitations on their cases had long passed. Those laws unleashed a flood of claims that led to financial ruin for some religious groups and helped drive six of the eight Catholic dioceses in New York to file for bankruptcy.\nBefore the passage of those laws, the archdiocese addressed abuse claims past the statute of limitations through an independent program established in 2016. But abuse survivors and their advocates criticized the program as an effort by the church to handle an embarrassing crisis in-house.\nOn Monday, Cardinal Dolan said the archdiocese had “made a series of very difficult financial decisions” to raise what he hoped would be more than $300 million to fund an eventual settlement.\nThose included reducing its operating budget by 10 percent, firing employees and selling “significant real estate assets,” including its longtime headquarters on First Avenue in Manhattan.

Texas enacted a law that lets private citizens sue out-of-state doctors who mail abortion medications into the state.\nAnd California approved legislation to protect those very same doctors, allowing abortion pills to be sent into Texas and other states without the name of the patient or prescriber on the prescription label.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade, granting state governments far more control over regulating abortions than they had had for nearly 50 years. \nIn the three years since, the divide between states that allow abortions and those that severely limit or ban them has only continued to deepen. In some cases, states are battling each other as they try to enforce their restrictions or protect access across state lines.\n“The U.S. is becoming a tale of two countries in terms of abortion access and abortion policy,” said Dr. Ushma Upadhyay, a professor and a public health scientist at the University of California, San Francisco. But, she added, “All of this legislation will never take away from the fact that women will continue to need abortion care, and continue to get abortion care.”\nDespite red states passing a spate of laws restricting abortion access in recent years, \nresearch shows\n that the number of abortions nationwide has climbed every year since 2022, when the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ended a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion.\nThat’s largely because doctors in states that permit abortions are providing more abortions to women living in states where the procedure is banned or highly restricted.\nSince 2022, the proportion of patients who travel out of state for abortions has increased substantially, studies have found. Carbondale, a small city in the southern tip of Illinois, illustrates this trend: three clinics there, within driving distance from 10 states that ban abortion, \nprovided 11,000 abortions last year,\n nearly all to out-of-state residents.\nAnd while more patients are traveling out of state for the procedure, experts say it is telehealth, in which doctors mail abortion medications so that pregnancies can be ended at home, that is driving much of the increase.\nLast year, one out of four abortions nationwide was provided via telehealth, compared to 5 percent before 2022, according to \nWeCount\n, a study led by the Society of Family"}

And in states where abortion was totally banned, 99 percent of abortions were provided by telehealth.\n“The reality is people are getting abortions, people are providing abortions, and the post-Dobbs environment is not stopping them,” said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University who co-wrote the book “\nAfter Dobbs\n.” \nMr. Cohen pointed out that the recent North Dakota court decision to ban abortion would likely have little impact on the ground because the state’s climate had been so hostile to abortion for years. There aren’t any providers left in the state to push out.\nAnd in Missouri, where anti-abortion advocates are trying to roll back access \nwith a ballot measure\n, women have already become accustomed to leaving the state or getting telehealth abortions because the abortion landscape has fluctuated so much in recent years, experts say.\n“Individual state borders no longer had the same meaning they once had,” said Carole Joffe, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, who co-authored the book with Mr. Cohen. “What we can conclude from the post-Dobbs era is that the abortion-providing community and women themselves have developed very creative modes of resistance.”\nThe popularity of telehealth, particularly in states where abortion is banned, has made it the latest frontier for abortion legislation in both red and blue states.\nLast week, Texas enacted a law that aims to stop doctors from other states from mailing abortion pills to Texas.\nTexas, where abortion is banned in almost all circumstances, is one of \n20 states\n that now ban abortion or restrict the procedure earlier in pregnancy than the standard set by Roe v. Wade. But roughly 35,800 people got abortions in Texas last year, virtually all through a telehealth provider, according to the WeCount data.\nThe new Texas law, known as HB 7, allows private citizens to file lawsuits for at least $100,000 against anyone who prescribes or mails abortion medication to Texas residents. It is the most ambitious effort yet to halt abortions through the telehealth process. \n“What anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates are trying to do is disrupt the new realities of abortion care"}

Wade — this is about really trying to stop all abortions anywhere, any way they can.”\nThose who oppose telehealth abortions say that doctors have overstepped by providing abortions for women who live in states where the procedure is not allowed. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, heralded the law for targeting “the underground abortion industry,” led by activists “hiding in liberal states.”\nSo far, medical providers have said the law won’t stop them from providing abortion medication to people in Texas.\nBlue states this year have strengthened their \nshield laws,\n which protect abortion providers from out-of-state prosecutions and are intended to allow them to keep prescribing medicines for people out-of-state. In at least eight states, including California and Massachusetts, officials are prevented from obeying subpoenas, extradition requests and other legal actions that states with bans take against abortion providers — a stark departure from typical interstate practices of cooperating in legal matters.\nThis summer, Republican attorneys general wrote to congressional leaders saying they were “asking Congress to assess the constitutional authority it may have to pre-empt shield laws.” The letter described the laws as “blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders and disrupt our constitutional structure.”\nInstead, Democratic lawmakers in states including New York, Washington and Colorado this year added safeguards that allow doctors to remove their full names from abortion medication prescriptions for privacy.\nCalifornia went even farther. In Colorado, for example, providers still must put the practice’s name, if not the individual doctor’s, on the prescription label.

That’s why it has been critical for states to step up and pass desperately needed A.I. safety standards while Congress sadly continues to delay enacting federal standards.

After years of waiting on Congress, both Democratic and Republican governors and state legislatures have passed their own deeply needed A.I. laws. Tennessee’s ELVIS Act gives artists control over their A.I.-generated digital replicas so others cannot use their voices and likenesses without consent. New laws in Utah require some companies to disclose when people are interacting with A.I. And from Alabama to Minnesota, 28 states have laws to rein in deceptive political deepfakes.\nFormer Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once argued that states are the laboratories of democracy.

Senator John Thune and I have come together to lead \na bill\n that would promote innovation and transparency for A.I. systems in high-risk settings such as health care or public safety. Other federal bills would protect creators online, similar to Tennessee’s ELVIS Act.\nBut as of now, these are just concepts and bills, not laws. States have no choice but to act.\nTech lobbyists have frequently opposed even the most sensible federal standards and rules — such as labeling videos as produced by A.I. or taking down unauthorized content. In an act of total hubris, they are now arguing that states should be banned from regulating A.I., and pushing the president and Congress to override the states’ laws.

We have seen the tragic consequences of the lack of enforceable safety standards, such as the young boy who \ndied by suicide\n after confiding in ChatGPT about his emotional struggles and plans about ending his life. Though the chatbot suggested he seek help, it also provided feedback on a photograph of a noose that the boy had made. Repealing what standards exist at the state level will only make it worse.\nOnce we actually have federal standards passed by Congress, it should be for Congress to decide whether to pre-empt state laws or allow them to go further. And as A.I. continues to evolve, there will always be new applications of the technology that spur states to act before the federal government does. That is something we should encourage — it is how our laboratories of democracy were intended to function.\nBut we can’t supersede state protections until we have strong, enforceable federal standards in place. So A.I. companies should join us in putting meaningful safeguards spearheaded by Congress in place at the federal level — and stop pretending that in the meantime, state standards are too much of a burden to bear. After all, how can you expect us to believe you’re on the precipice of creating groundbreaking superintelligence if you can’t manage to comply with a handful of state laws?\nTech leaders need to understand: There will be safety standards for these products. If they do not want a patchwork of state laws, they should work with Congress to pass comprehensive standards. Until then, states have a right — and a duty — to stand up for their citizens."}

Slaughter, is about whether President Trump can fire leaders from those agencies. If the court rules that he can do so at will, \nmy colleague Ann E. Marimow reports\n, it’s a very big deal — a significant expansion of presidential power. It would overturn a judicial precedent set 90 years ago, during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, when the court said Congress could limit a president’s ability to get rid of independent commissioners who hadn’t done something deeply wrong.\nTrump did just that. In March, he fired Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic appointee, from her position as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, saying that she did not align with his administration’s priorities.\nThe court probably won’t rule on the matter until late spring. But \nwhat our reporters heard\n from the justices yesterday was clear. The conservative majority seems poised to overturn or at least strictly limit the 1935 precedent, giving the president more control of government bodies that were meant to be nonpartisan.\nSafe from meddling\nFederal law limits the president’s authority to fire government officials who work for more than two dozen independent governmental agencies. That is designed to shield their independence, to protect them from the storms of politics.\nRoosevelt tested the law when he fired a member of the Federal Trade Commission whose agenda did not match his own. In that case, the court ruled unanimously that the firing was illegal.\nSince then, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the precedent without completely overturning it.\nDuring the 1980s, the future chief justice, John Roberts, then a Reagan staffer, argued that the White House should control independent federal agencies. The argument, as Ann \nrecently explained\n, was part of a push for more executive power under the so-called unitary executive theory, which says the president has absolute control over the executive branch.\nUnder Roberts’s leadership, the court’s majority has moved in that direction. In 2020, during Trump’s first term, the justices said the president could fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau without cause because the agency has only one director.\nThe F.T.C. has more than one leader, but the conservative justices signaled yesterday that because the agency has grown since the original ruling, its constitutional status may have changed.

Roberts characterized the 1935 precedent as “a dried husk” of its former self, saying it was written for an earlier time when the commission wielded much less power.\nThe ruling, when it comes, could affect more than two dozen other agencies that protect consumers, workers, the environment and more. They’ve traditionally been insulated from presidential control.\nThey include the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission — where Trump has also ousted Democratic leaders. (The Supreme Court let him do so while the cases make their way through lower courts.) Institutions run along partisan lines would be less likely to rule against a president’s priorities while adjudicating things like employee firings, antitrust cases and labor disputes.\nOne caveat: Some justices have suggested that the coming decision will not affect the Federal Reserve, which helps manage the economy and which may require unique protections from presidential interference. Next month, though, the justices will consider whether the president can fire Lisa Cook, a Fed governor whom Trump has accused of mortgage fraud.\nAnd so we wait. For Adam Liptak, our legal affairs reporter, what loomed large over the argument was last year’s Supreme Court decision granting Trump substantial immunity from prosecution — meaning he can do pretty much what he wants as president and it’s not a crime. In the justices’ responses yesterday, Adam observed, “there has been repeated reference to that decision’s expansive vision of presidential power.” What Roosevelt wanted, in other words, Trump very well could get.\nNow, let’s see what else is happening in the world.\nTHE LATEST NEWS\nPolitics\nWhen Japanese children have a milestone birthday, many go to a shrine.

Prosecutors say that between 2010 and 2013, a corrupt network of lawmakers and others diverted public funds through private foundations, then funneled those funds into political campaigns — including Mr. Hernández’s 2013 campaign.\nMr. Zelaya noted that his announcement coincided with International Anti-Corruption Day, Dec. 9. His social media message included a document dated Nov. 28 — the day \nMr. Trump first mentioned\n his plan to pardon Mr. Hernández — in which a Honduran Supreme Court justice asked Interpol to “carry out an immediate arrest,” including if Mr. Hernández was released by the U.S. authorities.\nMr. Hernández’s lawyer, Renato Stabile, said that announcing the warrant was “obviously a strictly political move” by the governing Libre Party, whose candidate is \ntrailing as ballots are counted\n from the recent presidential election. Mr. Zelaya was nominated to his post by the Libre Party, which has long been opposed to Mr. Hernández. \nMr. Hernández’s current whereabouts is unclear. He served as president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022, a period marred by corruption scandals. He was at the center of \na fraught election in 2017\n, when he secured a second term, despite a constitutional ban on re-election. His victory then was contested, protests broke out and the military was deployed in a bloody period that left nearly two dozen people dead.\nLess than a month after leaving office in 2022, Mr. Hernández was arrested and \nlater extradited\n to the United States \nto face drug-trafficking and weapons charges\n.

Mr. Stone, who played a role in delivering the letter to Mr. Trump, claimed that Mr. Hernández was a victim of a conspiracy tied to the U.S. government.\nMr. Trump said that \n“many friends”\n had made the case for the pardon.\n“He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” Mr. Trump \ntold reporters\n. “And they said it was a Biden administration setup. And I looked at the facts, and I agreed with them.”\nLast year, Mr. Hernández \nwas convicted and sent\n to prison for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and for possessing and conspiring to possess “destructive devices,” including machine guns.\nThe U.S. judge in his case, P. Kevin Castel, had called Mr. Hernández “a two-faced politician hungry for power” who masqueraded as an antidrug crusader while partnering with traffickers. U.S. prosecutors asked the judge to make sure Mr. Hernández died behind bars. \nMr. Hernández’s rumored connections to drug traffickers had escalated after his brother, a former lawmaker, was arrested in the United States on drug-trafficking charges in 2018.

Kathy Hochul, a Democrat.\nMs. Stefanik had worked furiously behind the scenes to fend off any primary challenge to maximize her chances against Ms. Hochul in a Democratic-leaning state. Now, a fight with Mr. Blakeman threatens to drain meaningful resources and shift the focus away from Ms. Hochul.\nBoth Republicans are jockeying for the support of the president, who indicated earlier on Monday that he would remain neutral for now.\n“He’s great, and she’s great,” Mr. Trump, a native New Yorker, told reporters at the White House on Monday before \nPolitico first reported\n that Mr. Blakeman’s intended to run.\nMs. Stefanik’s campaign issued a lengthy statement, attacking Mr. Blakeman as a spoiler who would help re-elect Ms. Hochul, a former lieutenant governor who took office in 2021 after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo resigned.\n“Even those in Nassau County who are closest to Bruce Blakeman will tell you that everyone knows Bruce has no shot and is putting his raging ego first and New Yorkers last as he blows up the best opportunity in a generation to save New York,” said Bernadette Breslin, a spokeswoman for Ms. Stefanik.\nThe two Republicans share a deep affinity for Mr. Trump and distaste for Ms. Hochul. But they come from starkly different parts of New York, different wings of the party and different generations.\nMr. Blakeman, 70, is a political force on Long Island, where he just won a second term by more than 10 points as Republicans lost in many other swing areas across the country. He has drawn national news headlines by \ncreating a force of armed volunteers\n to deploy in the case of civil unrest and \nseeking to bar transgender athletes\n from county facilities.\nBut since he first ran for state comptroller in the 1990s, Mr. Blakeman has never won a statewide race.

She has a powerful national fund-raising apparatus and has locked up endorsements from a large number of party leaders across the state, including Edward Cox, the state party chairman.\nMr. Blakeman and his allies do not appear to be cowed.\n“We don’t have coronations in our party,” the county executive \ntold a CBS affiliate\n in Albany in November during a tour of the state.\n“Competition is a good thing, and I’m going to travel around the state,” he said at the time. “And if I feel that I’m the best candidate to beat Kathy Hochul and to run the state, then I’m going to jump in.”\nHe is likely to begin by seeking the support of fellow Republicans in Nassau County. Alfonse D’Amato, a former Republican U.S. senator, said he expected Mr. Blakeman to run.\n“Don’t ever sell him short. He’s a hard worker, he makes a great impression,” he said. “He had a good win, and if there’s a primary, he’d be a very powerful candidate.”\nMs. Hochul, 67, is currently the favorite in the 2026 election.

Many mining companies polish, cut and prepare their diamonds for use in India, and then export them from there to the United States. The tariffs have made the finished gems more expensive.\n“We have a resource economy in Northwest Territories for the most part, and it’s always been that way,” the region’s premier, R.J. Simpson, said in an interview.\n“We’re at a point now,” he said, “where we know the diamond mines are winding down, and the question has been: ‘OK, well, what’s next?’”\nGeorge Betsina, 55, remembers putting up stakes to mark territory for prospecting for diamonds in 1992, right after deposits were discovered at a remote location, 186 miles northeast of \nYellowknife\n.\nA member of the Dene First Nation, Mr. Betsina was one of many young Indigenous men from communities in and around Yellowknife who left the dying gold mines to see if there was a future in diamonds.\nHe began working at one mine, Ekati, in 2000, and over the next quarter-century, he built a life and a family. His two brothers operated equipment at the mine, too, which provided good paychecks, but also required weeks on end away from home, flying in and out of workers’ camps just below the Arctic Circle.\n“Half my boys’ lives, I was in the mines,” Mr. Betsina said, speaking inside a wooden shack behind his home on the banks of the Great Slave"}

Mr. Betsina said that, at its height, Ekati employed more than 1,000 people, but fewer than 300 were left when he was laid off this summer.\nThe owner of the Ekati mine, a small Australian company named Burgundy Diamond Mines, is losing money in part because of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on India. Like many diamond miners, Burgundy’s gems are processed in India. The 50 percent tariff on Indian exports makes them more expensive in the United States and crushes the already subdued demand.\nIn September, Burgundy \nsuspended trading\n on the Australian stock exchange where it is listed, and requested a loan from a Canadian government fund intended to relieve the impact of tariffs on companies that operate in Canada.\nThe company has been slashing or even failing to make severance payments to workers it laid off over the summer, according to the workers’ union. Burgundy declined to comment or offer executives for an interview for this article but, in public statements, has acknowledged serious financial problems and pledged to eventually fully compensate workers.\nEkati’s struggles exemplify the problems the industry is facing, which have grown so severe that they may expedite the day of reckoning for diamond mining in the Northwest Territories. The mine is scheduled for closure in 2030. Now that five-year horizon seems optimistic.\nAll That Sparkles\nMining built up the economy of the Northwest Territories and depended on Indigenous skilled workers who became an integral part of its growth.\n“It’s kind of a scary situation,” said Chief Fred Sangris, who leads the Yellowknife Ndilo community of the \nDene First Nation\n. “Where do we go from here? What’s the next project? If we don’t align ourselves with the government and come up with another big project, then this work force might be sitting idle, and it’s not going to be good for the communities.”\nUntil recently, more than 3,000 Indigenous workers were employed at the three diamond mines, Indige"}

The population of the Northwest Territories is about 45,000, half of it Indigenous.\nAnnual salaries for skilled workers such as people operating heavy equipment or drilling underground could surpass six figures, in large part to compensate for the harsh conditions.\nLeaders across the Territories are banking on the hope that the ground holds yet more precious secrets. Smaller mines and new exploration efforts are focusing on \nrare earths\n and critical minerals.\nThese ores are vital for electronics, artificial intelligence and the defense industry, but China has a stranglehold on their production and trade, causing frustration and fear over supplies in the United States and the rest of the Western world.\nThe United States Defense Department has invested in one rare earths mining project in the Northwest Territories as part of a Biden-era program aimed at securing a supply.\n“There is such interest in critical minerals, which are used for everything we need for modern life, and we have an abundance of those in the Territories,” said Mr. Simpson, the premier.\nBut more mining, particularly of hard to extract minerals like rare earths, can be environmentally damaging. The Northwest Territories was the setting for one of the worst environmental contamination cases in Canadian mining history, at the Giant gold mine, which\n \nleft behind a devastating amount of toxic arsenic when it closed in 2004.\nAnd it is unlikely that the rare earths and other smaller mining projects will grow large enough soon enough to fully supplant the revenues and jobs lost by the closure of the diamond mines.\nMr. Simpson said another source of growth could come from Canada’s investment in \nmajor infrastructure projects\n and its focus on Arctic defense under Prime Minister Mark Carney, which residents and local leaders say are desperately needed in the Territories.\n“It feels now like a bit of a transitory phase, in which other projects will be coming online in the future,” Mr. Simpson said.

At 18, she was years into substance abuse when she decided to take an underground drilling course, lured by the good salaries the diamond mines were offering. She loved it.\nShe started working at Diavik in 2010, and the long stints she spent sober helped her break her addictions. In the depths of the mines, she met her future husband, who also works there, and together they built a coveted life: two children, 14 and 7, and a home in a pretty suburb of Yellowknife.\nBoth Ms. Rabesca and her husband, Charles, are retraining as large vehicle operators, which will allow them to drive trucks.\nMs. Rabesca would like to eventually work in mental health, and the retraining is giving her the confidence that she will continue to have an income until she figures out her next steps.\nBut leaving mining life behind will be hard, she said.\n“It’s exciting and scary. This is all I’ve ever known since I was 22,” she said, as she sat in her living room while her 7-year-old son played.\nHarder to replace than her income, she said, will be the community she found at the mine.\n“I liked the diversity,” she said. “You got old, you got young, you got people from the North, you got people from the South, like engineers are coming from Australia.”\n“I’ve loved meeting so many people along the way,” she said"}

He was 92.\nHis niece, Susan Tremblay, said the cause was prostate cancer.\nUnder the front-page banner headline “\nMEN WALK ON MOON\n,” with a Houston dateline of July 21, 1969, Mr. Wilford gave readers an awe-inspiring and comprehensive account of Apollo 11’s gentle touchdown and exploratory mission on the moon’s arid Sea of Tranquillity after a 230,000-mile voyage from Earth.\n“It was man’s first landing on another world,” he wrote, “the realization of centuries of dreams, the fulfillment of a decade of striving, a triumph of modern technology and personal courage, the most dramatic demonstration of what man can do if he applies his mind and resources with single-minded determination.”\nHe added: “The moon, long the symbol of the impossible and the inaccessible, was now within man’s reach, the first port of call in this new age of spacefaring.”\nFifty years later, Mr. Wilford, in a Times video, recalled that night at NASA’s mission control center in Houston when he realized that he would perhaps never again experience such a moment. “I thought to myself, yes, this is the biggest story I will probably ever write in my career,” he said. “Unless of course, I am still around reporting when people discover other life in the universe.”\nA Kentucky-born journalist who worked at The Wall Street Journal and Time magazine before joining The Times in late 1965, Mr. Wilford combined a passion for scholarship with a detective’s eye for detail and the literary skills of a master storyteller. His six-decade journalism career coincided with milestone discoveries in the mysteries of dinosaurs and early human life, and in space exploration.\nIn his first major assignment, on Dec. 15, 1965, Mr. Wilford won a Times in-house publisher’s award for coverage of a maneuver by four astronauts on two spacecraft, Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 — what he called “man’s first rendezvous in the vastness of outer space.” Crucial to any prospective moon landing, the mission demonstrated that two orbiting spacecraft could find each other, meet and probably link up.\n“In a spectacular performance of space navigation, the astronauts brought their craft within six to 10 feet of each other about 185 miles above t"}

He added, “The crews came close enough to see into each other’s cabins, trade gibes and inspect details on the exteriors of their funnel-shaped spacecraft.” The Gemini 6 crew, peering into Gemini 7, could see \nCmdr. James A. Lovell Jr.\n’s beard and could tell that Lt. Col. \nFrank Borman\n was chewing gum.\nMr. Wilford traveled widely as a correspondent. He flew through the eye of a hurricane for a story on cloud seeding, plunged into ocean depths in a research submersible, rode an astronaut-training centrifuge, operated lunar-landing and space shuttle simulators, joined a mapping party in the Grand Canyon, flew ice patrols over Greenland and Newfoundland, and ran rapids on the Colorado River.\nIn 1976, \nhe covered an expedition\n to Scotland to explore the longstanding mystery of the Loch Ness monster. With sonar probes and underwater television cameras, the expedition, partly funded by The Times, scanned the murky depths of the 23-mile-long lake for a month, but turned up no trace of the creature, said in legend and in many unverified accounts of sightings to be an undulating serpent.\nMr. Wilford’s assignments led to several books, starting with “We Reach the Moon,” about America’s space program, from President John F. Kennedy’s commitment in 1961 to the success of Apollo 11. It was published 76 hours after the Pacific Ocean splashdown of \nMr. Armstrong\n and Col. Buzz Aldrin, who had also walked on the moon, and Lt. Col. \nMichael Collins\n, who had remained in the orbital command ship.\nMr. Wilford’s other books include “The Mapmakers” (1981), about the history of surveying the Earth’s surface and ocean floors; “The Riddle of the Dinosaur” (1985); “Mars Beckons: The Mysteries, the Challenges, the Expectations of Our Next Great Adventure in Space” (1990); and “The Mysterious History of Columbus: an Exploration of the Man, the Myth, the Legacy” (1991).\nIn 1984, Mr. Wilford won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for articles “conveying both the wonder and the reality of science,” including the race between the United States and the Soviet Union to develop weapons of war for outer space.

His father was a Methodist minister in Kentucky and Tennessee.\nAs a boy, John was interested in journalism, covering sports and writing a weekly column of high school news for The Parisian, a newspaper in Paris, Tenn.\nAfter graduating from E.W. Grove High School in Paris in 1951, he attended Lambuth College in Jackson, Tenn., for a year before transferring to the University of Tennessee, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism in 1955. He received a master’s degree in political science from Syracuse University in 1956 and joined The Wall Street Journal. But he soon took a leave for Army service, from 1957 to 1959, serving for a time in the Counter Intelligence Corps in West Germany.\nReturning to The Journal, he covered medical research and the drug industry until 1962. After a year of political science studies at Columbia University on a Ford fellowship, Mr. Wilford joined Time as a contributing editor. In early 1965, he began writing for Time’s science section, producing cover stories on space exploration. He was soon hired by The Times for its own newly expanded science section.\nIn 1966, Mr. Wilford married Nancy Watts Paschall, a stage actress. She died in 2015. He had adopted her daughter from a previous marriage, Nona Paschall. Nona Paschall Wilford died in 2019.\nIn 2018, Mr. Wilford married Janet St. Amant, a former television actress. She survives him, in addition to his niece. \nMr. Wilford took a break from science writing at The Times from 1973 to 1974 to be an assistant national editor.

He directed the authorities in the member countries to act “to neutralise any aircraft that would violate the confederal space” in future.\nOn Monday, Nigerian authorities said the aircraft had been en route to Portugal for a ferry mission before “a technical concern which necessitated a precautionary landing”.\n“[The] crew is safe and have received cordial treatment from the host authorities,” said Ehimen Ejodame, the Nigerian air force spokesperson who signed the statement. “Plans are ongoing to resume the mission as scheduled.”\nThe incident unfolded less than 24 hours after Nigeria took part in an intervention in \nBenin\n, Burkina Faso’s south-eastern neighbour, after a group of soldiers seized control of the national television station in Cotonou and announced the ousting of the president, Patrice Talon.\nAuthorities in Benin later said they had foiled the coup attempt and restored order, preventing what would have been the eighth successful coup in west \nAfrica\n in five years.\nA statement from the Nigerian government said its airstrikes –targeting a military base in Cotonou where some of the coup planners were reportedly holed up – happened at the behest of Talon and were in compliance with the protocols of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). Ivorian aircraft were also seen hovering over Beninese airspace during the crisis, pointing to a coordinated response by countries aligned with the regional bloc.\nThe states that make up the AES broke away from Ecowas, headquartered in Nigeria, after Ecowas threatened military intervention in Niger in 2023 to reinstate the democratically elected president, Mohamed Bazoum, after he was ousted in a coup. The AES states accuse Ecowas of breaching territorial integrity and being a puppet of the west and have also drawn closer to Russia."}

The pleasure boat, which dates from the first half of the first century AD, was 35 metres long and constructed to hold a central pavilion with a luxuriously decorated cabin.\nIt was discovered off the submerged island of Antirhodos, which was part of ancient Alexandria’s Portus Magnus (great port).\nStrabo had visited the Egyptian city around 29-25BC and wrote of such boats: “These vessels are luxuriously fitted out and used by the royal court for excursions; and the crowd of revellers who go down from Alexandria by the canal to the public festivals; for every day and every night is crowded with people on the boats who play the flute and dance without restraint and with extreme licentiousness.”\nThe excavations were conducted by the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology (IEASM) under the direction of \nFranck Goddio\n, a visiting professor in maritime archaeology at the University of Oxford.\nHe told the Guardian: “It’s extremely exciting because it’s the first time ever that such a boat has been discovered in Egypt … Those boats were mentioned by different ancient authors, like Strabo, and they were also represented in some iconography – for example in the Palestrina mosaic, where you see such a boat of a much smaller size with noblemen hunting hippopotamuses. But [an actual boat] has never been discovered before.”\nA map showing the location of the boat in Alexandria’s Eastern Harbour\nWhile that mosaic depicts perhaps a 15-metre boat, this one is far larger, judging by its well-preserved timbers, which also span a breadth of about 7 metres. It may have required more than 20 rowers.\nIt had been lying only 7 metres under the water and 1.5 metres under the sediment. Goddio’s initial assumption was that there were two ships on top of one another “because the construction type was so strange”. He added: “The bow is flat … and the stern is round … to be able to navigate in very shallow water.”\nGoddio’s most ambitious projects have been conducted off the coast of Egypt, in Alexandria’s eastern harbour and in the Bay of Abu Qir.

In partnership with Egypt’s Ministry for Antiquities, he has explored a vast area since 1992.\nIn 2000, the ancient city of Thonis-Heracleion and parts of the city of Canopus were discovered in the Bay of Abu Qir – one of the greatest archaeological finds of recent times. Two colossal statues of a Ptolemaic queen and king are among spectacular treasures that have been retrieved so far.\nIn 2019, Goddio and his team found a wreck in the waters around \nThonis-Heracleion\n, whose unusual details matched the description of another ancient Greek historian, Herodotus.\nThe latest discovery lies less than 50 metres from the site of the Temple of Isis, which Goddio has been excavating. He believes the boat could have sunk during the catastrophic destruction of this temple around AD50.\nThe boat’s well-preserved timbers had been lying only 7 metres underwater and 1.5 metres under the sediment.\n Photograph: Christoph Gerigk ©Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation\nAfter a series of earthquakes and tidal waves, the Portus Magnus and parts of the ancient coastline sank beneath the sea, engulfing palaces and other buildings.\nAnother theory is that the boat could have been a sacred barge attached to the temple. Goddio said: “It could have … [been] part of the naval ceremony of the \nnavigium Isidis,\n when a procession celebrating [the goddess] Isis encountered a richly decorated vessel – the Navigium – which embodied the solar barque of Isis, mistress of the sea.”\nGraffiti in Greek was found on the central carling and is yet to be deciphered.\nAlthough research into the wreck is still at an early stage, it promises to reveal new insights into “life, religion, luxury and pleasure on the waterways of early Roman Egypt”, Goddio said.\nThe latest scientific results of excavations on the temple of Isis have recently been published by the Oxford Centre for Maritime \nArchaeology\n.\nProf Damian Robinson, the centre’s director, said of the new discovery: “It’s a type of ship that’s never been found before.

The opposition candidate Renaud Agbodjo was rejected by the electoral commission on the grounds that he did not have sufficient sponsors.\nIn their televised statement, the coup plotters mentioned the deteriorating security situation in northern Benin “coupled with the disregard and neglect of our fallen brothers-in-arms”.\nTalon has been credited with reviving the economy, but the country has also seen an increase in attacks by jihadist militants that have wreaked havoc in Mali and \nBurkina Faso\n."}

The agreement also stipulates that the United States must \nannually allocate 1.5m acre-feet of water\n from the Colorado River to Mexico.\nThe water from the Rio Grande is used to support agriculture in Texas and other US border states.\nIn a post on Truth Social on Monday, the president said that \nMexico\n “owes” the US 800,000 acre-feet of water due to violations of the treaty over the past five years.\nHe demanded Mexico release 200,000 acre-feet of water before 31 December, and more “soon after”.\nThe lack of water was hurting crops and livestock in Texas, Trump said.\n“As of now, Mexico is not responding, and it is very unfair to our U.S. Farmers who deserve this much needed water,” Trump added. “That is why I have authorized documentation to impose a 5% Tariff on Mexico if this water isn’t released, IMMEDIATELY.”\nA spokesperson for Mexico’s economy ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn April, US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said that Mexico had agreed to increase its water shipments to Texas to help make up a shortfall under the 1944 treaty.\nMexico has argued that it is under drought conditions that have strained the country’s water resources. While climate-crisis induced drought plays a large role in the Rio Grande’s depletion, overconsumption and mismanagement have also contributed to its current state. A recent \nWorld Wildlife Study\n found that 52% of the water consumed from the Rio Grande is unsustainable, meaning that it is contributing to overall depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself.\nThe study also found that water shortages have led to the loss of 18% of farmland in the river’s headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico, and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.\nskip past newsletter promotion\nafter newsletter promotion\nThis is not the first time the delay of water from Mexico has caused political tensions.

The money will go to producers of corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, rice, wheat and other row crops, \naccording to the USDA’s announcement\n, and is expected to be released in February 2026.

Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”."}

The record trade surplus comes even as exports to the US have plummeted, a reflection of the bruising \nUS-China trade war\n that, despite a \nrecent cooling\n, has dampened the flow of goods between the world’s two largest economies.\nExports to the US plummeted by nearly a third in November. Speaking on Tuesday, Chinese premier Li Qiang said the “mutually destructive consequences of tariffs have become increasingly evident”.\nThe fall in exports to the US has led to concerns that China is flooding other parts of the world – especially south-east Asia and Europe – with cheap goods that threaten local industry.\nChinese-made vehicles wait to be loaded on to ships for export in Shanghai. \n Photograph: Costfoto/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\nBut experts believe that many of the goods bound for south-east Asia ultimately end up in the US, via a practice known as trans-shipment where products are sent via a third country to avoid tariffs. That is because the demand in the US for cheap products has not gone away, and few countries can replicate China’s mammoth ability to produce consumer goods at scale at low prices.\nIn the first eight months of this year, the US imported $23.1bn in goods from Indonesia, an increase of nearly a third on the same period in 2024. Experts believe this rise is largely down to Chinese goods being redirected via Indonesia.\nThere have also been increases in imports from Malaysia and the Philippines.\nThe statistics suggest that the huge tariffs placed by the US and China on each other’s goods has dented bilateral trade but done little to change the overall flow of goods in the global economy.\nAnd as China becomes dominant in the production of hi-tech goods such as electric vehicles and batteries, it is unlikely to lose its place as the world’s factory for the products that are vital to global development.

According to a readout in state media, the cadres discussed the need to “continuously expand domestic demand” and to make consumption the “main driver” of the economy.\nBoosting consumer spending is expected to be a top economic priority in 2026. But policymakers have a big hill to climb. Chinese households are keen on saving money, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic and real estate crash in China that wiped out many people’s savings. Chinese consumption as a share of GDP is about 50%, compared to about 80% in the US."}

Guardian Australia has received several reports of those \nunder 16 passing the facial age assurance tests\n, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.\nAll listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.\nBluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.\nChildren had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.\nThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.\nParents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”.

But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.\n“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”\nPolling has consistently shown that \ntwo-thirds of voters support\n raising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recently \nvoiced alarm about the ban\n, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.\nThe ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.\nInman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.\nQuestions included “how many accounts [they’ve] deactivated or removed, what challenges they’re finding, how they’re preventing recidivism and preventing circumvention, whether or not their abuse or reporting abuse and the appeals processes are working as planned”, she said.\nskip past newsletter promotion\nSign up to \nBreaking News Australia\nGet the most important news as it breaks\nPrivacy Notice: \nNewsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some were detained by French police for their actions.\nThe French association Utopia 56, which works on beaches in northern France where migrants try to cross the Channel, reported them to the police.\n“They were detained for several hours before being released,” a Utopia 56 spokesperson said. “We have been monitoring the social media accounts of these various groups daily and reporting them to the public prosecutor and prefecture.\n“However, even though we hear our alerts are taken seriously, to date nothing has been done to prevent them from coming to the beaches along the coast. When the far right advances unchecked, human rights erode.”\nAccording to Raise the Colours on social media, 5,500 people have offered to go to France to intervene to “stop the boats”, something it says the UK and French authorities are failing to do.\nRaise the Colours has circulated appeals for stab-proof vests, plate carriers, high-powered torches, thermal cameras, drones and encrypted radios.

However, taking the law into your own hands will not resolve the issue.\n“The home secretary has announced the biggest reforms to tackle illegal migration in decades, to restore order and control to our borders and make it less attractive for illegal migrants to come to Britain.”\nHome Office sources said France was reviewing its maritime doctrine to strengthen its ability to intercept small boats in the water and that a new unit would be established in Dunkirk to expedite prosecutions of smugglers.\nThe French interior ministry has been approached for comment.\nRaise the Colours has also been contacted for a response."}

The fourth victim, a woman, died on Monday, a day after being revived at the scene and airlifted to a hospital.\nTwo of the victims were Romanian and two were Slovaks, their respective governments said. No further information about the identities of the victims was provided.\nThe pool at Isla Cangrejo, on Tenerife’s Los Gigantes coast, is very popular with foreign tourists, according to local media. Bordered by volcanic rock on one side and walled off from the sea on the other, the pool sits at nearly sea level and can be very dangerous during rough seas when large waves can easily overcome the cement barrier.\nLocal media reported that a weather advisory for rough seas was in effect at the time when the swimmers were swept out to sea. One media outlet reported that the pool had been closed to swimmers since 3 December.\nResidents said swimmers had ignored signs and fencing put up to prevent anyone from going into the pool because of the weather conditions. They said it’s very difficult for anyone dragged out to sea to get a foothold on slippery rocks just below the pool.\n“People ... don’t know how the sea is here, and the danger of the pool, because there are rocks below on which people fall and can’t get back up. It’s very dangerous,” said one resident who didn’t give his name.\nEmilio Navarro, the mayor of Santiago Del Tiede, offered his condolences to the families of the dead and said rescue crews continued on Monday to search for the missing swimmer.\nHe said authorities take steps to warn bathers of the dangers and to dissuade them from using the pool during rough seas. “We ... ask people to pay attention to the signage put up by the authorities,” he said. “It’s to take care of and protect everyone.”\nIn November, \nstrong waves killed three people\n and injured 15 in Tenerife by pulling them into the Atlantic Ocean during a tidal surge."}

These include a visit to the UN general assembly, the climate change conference in Brazil, and numerous Arab summits.\nIn the latest sign of the goodwill directed towards Syria’s rebirth, envoys from all 15 members of the UN security council were in Damascus last week to \nmark the anniversary of the fall of Bashar al-Assad\n. The display of unity was a remarkable moment: since 2011 no issue has divided the security council more bitterly than Syria.\nThe visit was also an acknowledgment of the role Syria and its diaspora can play in bringing stability to the Middle East.\nBut ultimately the test will be whether Sharaa is able to translate this curiosity and goodwill into something tangible for the Syrian people in terms of lifted sanctions, internal stability and freedom from external meddling, whether by Israel, Iran or Sharaa’s potential ideological partner \nTurkey\n.\nOn the investment front, overseas pledges are rolling in. Saudi Arabia has promised investments worth more than $6bn (£4.5bn). Qatar is helping to revive the oil and gas industry and the final set of US sanctions is likely to be lifted in a vote before Christmas. But such is the chaos, Syria’s central bank admits it does not know the country’s true GDP.\nThe influx of Gulf investment is dependent on Sharaa continuing on a path of internal reconciliation and trust-building, far removed from the extremist threat. At the same time he has to show his still-reeling country is not being used as a base from which either Islamists in the south can threaten \nIsrael\n or from which Kurds in the north will threaten Turkey.\nIn this task he has gained the unlikely support of Donald Trump, who has promised to visit Damascus soon.

We have peace now in the Middle East – the first time that anyone can remember that ever happening.”\nTrump also obligingly brushed aside Sharaa’s controversial history. “We’ve all had rough pasts,” he said, as if property contract disputes in New York were on a par with Sharaa’s military turf war in Raqqa with the leader of Islamic State (Isis), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in which Sharaa lost 1,200 fighters.\nPerhaps the most striking of Sharaa’s many meetings was on stage in New York in September when he was interviewed by Gen David Petraeus, the former CIA director and retired army general \nwho commanded US forces in Iraq while Sharaa was imprisoned there with other members of al-Qaida\n. Petraeus showed concern for the Syrian leader’s personal wellbeing, asking whether he was getting enough sleep. He added his former prisoner had “many fans” and that he was one of them. Sharaa said with a smile when asked about their shared past: “At a time, we were in combat and now we move to discourse.”\n“We cannot judge the past based on the rules of today and cannot judge today based on the rules of the past,” the Syrian president said.\nDavid Petraeus, a former director of the CIA and ex-US military general, with Sharaa during the Concordia Annual Summit in New York, in September.\n Photograph: HOGP/AP\nThat willingness to reject the rules of the past is reflected in the remarkable joint intelligence operations Syria’s interior ministry conducted alongside the US last month, locating 15 Isis weapons caches in southern Syria.\nThe concern is that external pressures are hampering Sharaa in his daunting task of keeping the country unified.

But Trump may argue that by weakening Sharaa, Israel is only fuelling the instability in which extremism thrives.\nIn Syria’s north, Sharaa’s efforts to integrate the Syrian Kurd fighters mainly in the SDF into a Syrian national army, once due to be completed by December, have stalled. For years Turkish policy has been driven by animosity toward the mainly Kurdish SDF, which it equates with the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), a group that it sees as a terrorist group operating inside Turkey.\nThe SDF claims to have about 70,000 men and women in its ranks and has received years of US training as part of the American-led coalition’s ongoing efforts to stamp out all remnants of Isis. It controls 25% of Syria’s territory. The SDF fears that disarmament could leave its fighters vulnerable to attacks from Islamist groups aligned with Sharaa.\nThe SDF agreed in March to integrate with the Syrian military but only so long as its forces enjoyed a degree of autonomy.\nBut since then Turkey has intensified talks about a possible peace deal with the PKK’s leader, Abdullah Öcalan, imprisoned on İmralı Island\nIn a recent interview with Al-Monitor, the Syrian Kurdish leader Aldar Khalil argued the solution to the issue of SDF integra"}

With a transitional justice process moving too slowly for its victims, old grievances are surfacing in new cycles of violence, threatening fragile efforts to rebuild the state.\nThe deftness of Syria’s new president Sharaa’s diplomatic charm offensive has been stunning, especially coming from a former jihadi leader: forging a relationship with Donald Trump, easing US sanctions on Syria and becoming a fixture at international conferences.\nDonald Trump received Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House on 10 November.\n Photograph: Balkis Press/Abaca/Shutterstock\nScenes of Sharaa meeting Trump and Syria’s return to the global stage have filled many Syrians with pride. “Even if I don’t li"}

After 14 years of civil war that flooded the Middle East and Europe with drugs, created the world’s largest displacement crisis since the second world war and allowed Islamic State to establish a caliphate, the world has been eager to unite behind the new Syrian president.\nSharaa gained power in part by capitalising on a weakened Iranian axis after Israel’s assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon prevented Tehran from saving its Syrian client, Assad. Sharaa has since managed to keep Iranian elements from re-establishing themselves in Syria, much to the delight of western capitals.\nBut at home, stalled transitional justice is fuelling renewed violence and deepening the country’s divides.\nPeople in the city of Qamishli gather for a protest against a wave of sectarian violence targeting Syria’s Alawite minority, in March.\n Photograph: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty Images\nFour days of massacres perpetrated by government forces and other armed factions against mostly Alawite civilians on Syria’s coast in March and continued killings have left the religious minority feeling besieged.\nAnother massacre in July in which members of government security forces and tribal elements killed Druze civilians in the southern province of Sweida further put the country’s religious and ethnic minorities on edge.\nSince the massacres, Sweida has been virtually sealed off from the rest of the country.

The tasks ahead of them are momentous: untangling ownership of appropriated property and establishing justice for crimes committed during the civil war while maintaining social cohesion.\nIn mid-November, Syrian authorities carried out a public trial of Assad loyalists and members of the new security forces accused of violence during the March coastal massacres.

The bodies dedicated to pursuing accountability remain underfunded. If the slow pace of transitional justice is maintained, the activists warn, the brief window to deliver justice will close.\n“After all these months, the state is strengthening, external relations are improving, things are calming,” said Alaa Ibrahim, a civilian activist in Homs who works on social cohesion. “But now we’re a year into the liberation, if assassinations keep happening every day, where will that leave us?”\nSoldiers conduct checks during a temporary curfew in Homs after a double killing last month.\n Photograph: Abobaker Alsaka/Anadolu/Getty Images\nThe question of justice is now inseparable, many Syrians say, from a broader debate over the shape of the new, post-Assad Syrian state.\nSyria’s new social contract is still being written and the actions of Syria’s new authorities are beginning to define the values that will govern the relationship between a population and a state that for the last half-century has ruled through fear.\nThere is no question that Syrians are enjoying a newfound freedom that would have been impossible to imagine a year earlier. “A year ago, people wouldn’t dare complain about the price of a kilo of onions. Now they are calling for ministers to resign,” Ayman Ali quipped.\nBut civil society activists warn there is little mention of democracy in the new Syria, a key demand of revolutionaries over the last 14 years.

The fact that Syria is stable a year after the cessation of 14 years of civil war feels like “a miracle”, he says, even if he has not got the justice he once dreamed of.\nBut the shadow of Assad’s crimes still looms large over Ali and over Syria, as the lure of revenge threatens the country’s suddenly bright future.\n“If every person took justice into their own hands, the country would collapse,” he said, his remaining eye fixed steadily ahead. “We’ve spent 14 years exhausted, displaced.

As Aparna Pande, the director of the India and south Asia initiative at the Hudson Institute thinktank, put it, Delhi is grappling with its most unfavourable geopolitical climate in years thanks to “a semi-isolationist America, a weaker Russia and a very powerful China”.\nIn a notable sign of the tightrope India has to walk, on the eve of Putin’s arrival a joint opinion piece by the French ambassador, the German high commissioner and the UK high commissioner to India was published in the Times of India, titled “Russia doesn’t seem serious about peace”.\nIt prompted a stinging response from India’s foreign ministry, which said it was “not an"}

It is an alliance that was long tolerated by western governments, even after Putin’s actions in Ukraine, but Trump’s return to the White House has signalled a markedly different approach.\nOver the past three years, the US and Europe turned a blind eye as India became one of the largest buyers of cheap Russian oil, despite sanctions in the west. But after the US president’s peacemaking efforts in Ukraine failed earlier this year, Trump began to accuse India of bankrolling Russia’s invasion. He publicly put pressure on Delhi to \nhalt its Russian oil purchases\n, which culminated in a punishing additional 25% punitive US tariff on Indian imports.\nIn Delhi, which has pursued a multi-alignment foreign policy since independence and reacts poorly to any outside interference, the perceived attempts by Trump to meddle and coerce were met with outrage, resulting in the worst decline in US-India relations in years.\nIn response, Pande said, India had returned to its default mode of “hedging” in its unorthodox alliances, “signalling to the US it has multiple options and waiting to see where everything will fall”. The last meeting between Putin and Modi was just three months ago, alongside the Chinese premier, Xi Jinping, where \nthe three leaders were pictured holding hands\n and sharing jokes – optics that prompted fury from Trump.\nPutin, Modi and Xi Jinping together in China in September. India has returned to its default mode of ‘hedging’ in its unorthodox alliances.\n Photograph: AP\nYet India has other pressing priorities in its engagement with Russia, namely the vast superpower that sits along its febrile north and north-eastern border. “From the Indian side – for all the talk of Russia being a great and loyal friend – the real reason that relationship is important is geography,” said Pande. “China remains the greatest threat to India for the foreseeable future and since the Soviet Union, India"}

For decades, about 70% of Indian defence purchases came from Russia but in the past four years this has reduced to less than 40%.\nWhile the sale of weapons and planes – in particular Russian S-400 air defence systems and the Sukhoi Su-57 fighter aircraft – will probably be a key component of Modi and Putin’s talks on Friday, Pande said: “India will try to strike a balance; keep purchasing enough Russian weapons to retain the alliance, but not be so dependent that if Russia suddenly cut off supplies under China’s pressure, India would be left hanging.”\nFor all the bear hugs and golf buggy rides that Modi and Putin have publicly enjoyed together in recent years, “this is a relationship based on pure realpolitik”, she added.\nThe question of oil\nGrowing economic cooperation and bilateral trade between the two countries is also likely to be on the table at the summit. At an event on Tuesday with leading Russian economists, Putin emphasised Russia’s plan to take its cooperation with China and India “to a qualitatively new level”, flying in the face of western sanctions.\nThe question of oil also looms large. While Modi has insisted that India would continue to buy Russian oil, newly imposed sanctions by the US and EU which \nthreaten companies that buy from Russia\n have led to a notable slowdown in purchases by the Indian private sector. Meanwhile, in a move seen as an attempt to appease Trump, India has agreed to import more US oil and gas.\nIn a briefing this week, Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, acknowledged “obstacles” in economic and energy cooperation between the two countries but said they would continue uninterrupted.

However, the older design of the M48 Severn Bridge didn’t include these barriers, and we sometimes need to restrict access to the Severn Bridge for the safety of our road users. When this happens, traffic is diverted on to the M4 Prince of Wales Bridge.\n\n\nWe use dedicated forecasts and monitoring equipment on the bridge, which are more useful than forecasts found in the media and wind speeds measured in neighbouring communities.\n\n\nWhen we expect gusts above 40 knots (46mph), we close the Severn Bridge to all traffic until the wind speeds have dropped.\n\n\nIf wind speeds exceed 70 knots (80mph), both bridges are closed. Traffic can still travel between England and Wales by following a diversion using the M5, M50, A40 and A449.\n\n\nThe M48 Severn Bridge has been closed in both directions due to strong winds.\n Photograph: Zoe Head-Thomas/PA\nShare\nUpdated at \n07.12 EST\nUlster University\n has said it will be closing its \nColeraine\n and \nDerry~Londonderry\n campuses from 1pm today due to the adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Bram, but noted that its \nBelfast\n campus will remain open.\nHere are some of the latest images being sent to us over the newswires:\nA van drives through deep flood water on Litton Lane at Burton Bradstock in Dorset.\n Photograph: Graham Hunt/Alamy Live News/Alamy Live News.\nLarge waves whipped up by Storm Bram crash against the historic Cobb harbour wall at Lyme Regis in Dorset.\n Photograph: Graham Hunt/Alamy Live News/Alamy Live News.\nWaves batter the coastline at Dawlish, Devon.\n Photograph: William Dax/SWNS\nNearly 80 flood warnings in place as Storm Bram sweeps the UK\nThere are nearly 80 flood warnings in place"}

Quite simply, our sickness benefit system was not designed to handle the age of diagnosis which we now live in.”\nBadenoch indicated that the Conservatives would significantly scale back which conditions entitled people to help. “We are going to review which conditions the states treats as disabilities when it comes to benefits,” she said.\n“All of us will have physical and mental challenges at some point in our lives, but in an age in which one in four people now self-report as disabled, it’s clear that we are now going to have to draw a line on what health issues the state can support.”\nShe said the changes would be needed to help the UK better absorbed what she called “shocks” to the economy – using Brexit as an example of this alongside Covid and the financial crisis.\nBadenoch suggested a move away from measuring poverty in relative terms (those receiving less than 60% of the median income).\n“That is not a measure of poverty at all,” she said. “It is a bad measure, because in a booming economy, as incomes rise, more people can be classed as being in poverty, even though their real income is rising.\n“We need something bett"}

I long said that Britain is at risk of becoming a welfare state with an economy attached.”\nIn the speech and subsequent media Q&A, Badenoch repeatedly framed the rise in benefit spending as in part a product of choice and abuse of the system, saying many people were turning down work “because they think that those jobs are beneath them”.\nBut she rejected the idea that language about an age of diagnosis and what she again called a “budget for benefits street” could stigmatise people and appear nasty. “I think that politicians should be careful with language all the time, but I don’t think there’s anything wrong in what I said,” she replied.\n“We spend a lot of time trying so hard not to upset people, or say anything that might ruffle any feathers, that we end up creating a system that is unworkable. I won’t apologise for the language I use. I’m actually very careful with my language, but I use language that’s going to cut through.”"}

(See \n12.06pm\n.)\nBut Keir Starmer is due to meet the US ambassador, Warren Stephens, in Downing Street this afternoon.

Asked if the PM agreed with Trump about Europe being a group of “decaying” nations, the spokesperson said:\n\n\nObviously you’ve seen the strong relationship between the prime minister and the president, that closeness has seen a trade deal secured with the US, securing and protecting and creating jobs, and it’s seen close work with our closest security partner and clearly later today the prime minister will welcome the US ambassador.\n\n\nThe spokesperson would not even criticise the president directly for his comments about Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London.\nThe full transcript of the Trump interview is \nhere\n, and in it \nTrump\n says:\n\n\nIf you take a look at London, you have a mayor named Khan.

She did not set out a full programme, but she did give more detail about the sorts of cuts she would favour.\nRestoring the two-child benefits cap\nThe Tories have already said they would restore the two child benefit cap. Today Badenoch produced new figures which she said explained why people are “angry” about \nLabour\n getting rid of it. She said:\n\n\nWell under Labour, there won’t be an economy to attach for much longer.\n\n\nIn Hackney alone, 1,000 families on benefits with 5 or 6 children stand to gain £74 million from the lifting of the two-child benefit cap.\n\n\nSome of those families will be getting more than £14,000 extra a year.\n\n\nAt the Budget, income tax thresholds were frozen.\n\n\nDo you know how many people’s thresholds were frozen just to pay for those families in Hackney?\n\n\n340,000 taxpayers.\n\n\nTo pay for 1,000 families.\n\n\nNo wonder people are angry\n\n\nWhile those on the minimum wage agonise over whether they can afford another child.\n\n\nPeople on benefits will get paid an extra £3,500 for every child they have because Labour is lifting the two-child benefit cap.\n\n\nLabour has strong defended the move, saying it will lift almost 500,000 children out of poverty. But Badenoch also said she did not accept the definition of poverty used by Labour. (See \n11.26am\n.)\nTightening the household benefit cap\nAs well as the two-child benefit cap, George Osborne introduce a cap on the total amount of benefits a household can receive when he was chancellor. \nBadenoch\n implied she would tighten this, saying it had too many loopholes. She said:\n\n\nWe will undertake a full review of the level and operation of the household benefit cap, which currently acts more like a sieve than a cap because most people on benefits avoid it through one exemption or another.\n\n\nExemptions like being diagnosed with anxiety which can be worth more, than £20,000 to some families.\n\n\nRestricting access to sickness benefits\nBadenoch\n has often alleged that it is too easy for people to get sickness benefits.

She said:\n\n\nWork, contribution and purpose give you value, dignity.

There is a simple choice at hand: lifting half a million children out of poverty with Labour, or plunging kids back into that misery under Tory plans.\n\n\nBadenoch claims Labour using wrong measure to assess whether people are in poverty\nHere is the full quote from \nKemi Badenoch\n in her welfare speech saying Labour’s poverty measure is flawed. (See \n10.20am\n.) She said:\n\n\nLabour will claim that they raise taxes to eradicate child poverty.\n\n\nWe Conservatives need to take on this argument that raising taxes on working people is the best way to eradicate poverty. It is not.\n\n\nLabour believe that the way to end poverty is give money to people in poverty, and give them more money until they’re not in poverty anymore. This has never worked.\n\n\nThe best way to get children out of poverty is for their parents to have jobs, and for these jobs to pay well.\n\n\nBut Conservatives also need to challenge bad metrics and wrong assumptions that create flawed policy.\n\n\nLet us start with the metric of relative poverty which Labour use.\n\n\nRelative poverty just tells you what proportion of households earn below 60% of median income. That’s not a measure of poverty at all.\n\n\nIt is a bad measure because in a booming economy, as incomes rise, more people can be classed as being in poverty even though their real income is rising.\n\n\nAnd then during a recession like we had under the last Labour government, where GDP collapsed and unemployment went through the roof, relative poverty fell even th"}

We have to challenge the thinking that underpins it. We need something better.\n\n\nThere are \nother ways of measuring poverty\n, but Badenoch did not say which one she preferred.\nKemi Badenoch giving her speech in London today.\n Photograph: Toby Shepheard/AFP/Getty Images\nShare\nUpdated at \n06.37 EST\nTories say Lib Dems are trying to 'turn the clock back' with call to join customs union with EU\nThe Conservatives have criticised the \nLiberal Democrats\n for proposing a custom union with the EU by saying Ed Davey’s party is trying to “turn the clock back”.\nIn a statement on the 10-minute rule bill (see\n 9.58am\n), \nPriti Patel,\n the shadow foreign secretary, said:\n\n\nEd Davey and the Liberal Democrats have never moved on from the Brexit referendum nearly a decade ago. And they will never stop trying to reopen the debates of the past - whatever the cost - when the rest of the country has long since moved on.\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats would rather try to turn the clock back, than focus on the difficult decisions needed to tackle welfare spending so we can live within our means.\n\n\nWhat is interesting about this statement is that it contains no attempt to defend the Boris Johnson \nBrexit\n deal, which rejected custom union membership, as good for the UK.\nThere was more evidence of this yesterday when Lord McFall, the Lord Speaker, published \nthe transcript\n of his latest Lord Speaker’s Corner podcast interview, with \nMichael Gove.\nGove, who is now a Tory peer, was one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, and in 2016 he and colleagues highlighted the supposed economic benefits of leaving the EU. But, when asked about the tangible benefits, he gave a reply just focusing on a constitutional point. He said:\n\n\nAs for the benefits that Brexit has brought, I think the fundamental benefit is that it has made this place, not just the House of Lords, but parliament itself, more important.\n\n\nBecause one of my frustrations was, all the time that I was a cabinet minister, I would find myself being invited to agree or disagree with government policy in particular areas.

Or do you think that people are just getting a diagnosis to claim benefits?\nBadenoch\n says she thinks it is “a bit of both”.\nShe says there are people not in work with severe mental health issues.\nBut she says there are also people clearly playing the system. She says you can watch the so-called “sickfluencers” on Instagram telling people how to cheat.\nAnd that’s the end of the Q&A.\nQ: Are you worried that some of the language that you are using, about a \nBenefits\n Street budget, for example, is stigmatising?\nBadenoch\n does not accept this. She claims to be careful about the language that she uses. But she says she wants to use language that cuts through.\nBadenoch says she would like to get welfare spending back down to pre-Covid levels\nQ: Is it realistic to get welfare spending back to pre-Covid levels?\nYes, says \nBadenoch\n. She says that is realistic.\nBadenoch complains about sickness benefits going to people with ADHD or anxiety\nQ: When you look at health benefits, are you just going to restrict mental health benefits, or is it all health benefits?\nBadenoch\n says there are a lot of people with disabilities who can work.\nShe says it is not right that people should be able to get extra money for an ADHD diagnosis. She claims people who are anxious can decide not to work and to get benefits. That is not right.\nBut where the line gets drawn will be decided by the review, she says.\nUPDATE: \nBadenoch\n said:\n\n\nWe have talked about a lot of low-level mental health issues that should not qualify [for benefits]. The ADHD diagnosis can get a family an extra £20,000. That is not right. But the detail of where we need to draw the line is going to be done by our economic unit …\n\n\nRight now there is no line. People can just say that they can’t work, that they’re anxious and they get benefits. That’s why we have more children in workless households than the entire population of Estonia.

She says at times in her life she did not have money.\nBut she says that at the moment there are people out of work who are better off than people in work. That does not fix poverty at all, she says.\nShe says we need a welfare system. It should be a safety net. But it should not be a welfare state, she says.\nUPDATE:\n \nBadenoch\n said:\n\n\nOf course it bothers me.\n\n\nI remember a time when I didn’t have much money at all, I had to work at the same time as I was going to college.\n\n\nI was on the minimum wage, fending for myself.\n\n\nSo I know what it’s like, and I know that there are many people in worse off situations.\n\n\nBut the way to deal with poverty is not by taking money from the people who are struggling and then giving it to those on benefits …\n\n\nWe need a welfare system. Of course we do. We need that safety net. But we mustn’t become a welfare state. That’s a completely different thing.\n \n\n\nShare\nUpdated at \n07.50 EST\nBadenoch\n is now taking questions.\nQ: Will you be consulting Iain Duncan Smith about this?\nBadenoch\n says Duncan Smith is the father of welfare reform.\nBut the problems he was work and pensions secretary (he created universal credit) are different from the problems now."}

They will also look at producing vans together.\n“We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry,” Jim Farley told journalists in Paris. “There is no better example than here in Europe.”\nThe rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers has put enormous pressure on European and US rivals, who have been slower to develop battery-powered vehicles.

Renault had previously \nplanned to sell shares of its Ampere unit\n as a separate company dedicated to electric car technology, but it abandoned that plan last year as investor interest waned.\nThe companies said Renault’s plant at Douai in northern France would produce the vehicles.

The casinos are projected to open over the next five years.\nBut some city residents and gambling researchers argue that urban casinos do not benefit cities and instead just take revenue from existing businesses while increasing gambling addiction and not actually providing many high-paying jobs.\n“They say it’s going to generate all this money, but it’s not generating that money,” said Jonathan Krutz, a Boise State University emeritus professor of marketing who has done extensive research \non casinos\n.\nKrutz added: “It’s just moving it around in the economy.

Once the casino opens, however, it will only need 3,503 full-time employees.\n“It always struck me as odd that that you would build a casino for the construction jobs because those are ephemeral,” Krutz, of Boise State, said. “Would you put a nuclear waste site in New York City for the construction jobs? I mean, what you are building is something that is going to be an active drain on the local economy.”\nAsked about a potential increase in gambling addiction, Bean said the board urged the commission to require that casino operators “be much more aggressive in terms of the problem gambling, that they don’t just help problem gamblers by identifying resources but that they intervene”.\n“There will be a certain number of people who have that problem, and I’m very sympathetic to those people and to their families,” Bean said. “But those people may also be going to whatever gambling is available to them, so I think it’s up to the agencies and it’s up to the state to really enforce this.”\nTax revenue from casinos that opened in recent decades in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia also stayed flat or declined, \naccording to\n an Urban Institute and Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center report.\nA temporary Bally’s casino in Chicago generated $16.1m in gaming tax revenue for the city in 2024, less than half of what was projected, according to a \ncity council report\n.\nThe novelty of a new casino eventually wears off, and “the market is saturated”, said Lucy Dadayan, principal research associate at the Tax Policy Center.\nAlso, people spending more money on online betting likely means they spend less on brick-and-mortar casinos, said Dadayan.\nKristy Marmorato, a city council member from the Bronx, led a successful effort earlier this year to defeat a rezoning for the proposed Bally’s casino, which she described as a “\npredatory development\n”.\nBut now that the casino operators appear to be moving forward, “I hope for the best for them,” Marmorato said. “We just want to make sure they follow through with their promises to my district.”"}

Last week in Washington a lengthy and glitzy ceremony saw the draw taking place for the 2026 men’s Fifa World Cup, the largest edition of the tournament to date, to be staged across the US, Mexico and Canada next June and July. It looks set to be a geopolitical showpiece for Donald Trump, reinforced by the ludicrous sight of him being \nawarded Fifa’s inaugural peace prize\n. The football tournament will feature 48 teams, 12 groups and 104 matches, a huge expansion from the 32-team format in place since 1998.\nThe draw didn’t \nquite\n settle who is playing whom – the last six countries to qualify won’t be announced until March. But England and Scotland know who they will face, and Wales, Northern Ireland and Ireland have a glimpse of what awaits them if they can steer their way through the Uefa playoffs next year.\nFor today’s newsletter I spoke to the Guardian’s \nPaul MacInnes\n, who has been closely following the organisation of the tournament, about whether the new format is an expansion too far, the politics of this hosting choice, the environmental impact, and how \nFifa\n seems set on bending its own rules. First, though, here are today’s big stories.\nFive big stories\n\n\n\n\nPolitics\n \n| Police are looking at allegations that \nReform UK breached electoral law\n during its campaign to win leader Nigel Farage’s seat in Clacton at last year’s general election. The party denies claims by a Reform ex-councillor that it falsely reported expenses at the Clacton constituency.\n\n\n\n\nUkraine\n | European leaders \nrallied behind Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n, at 10 Downing Street on Monday night. There was no breakthrough on allowing Ukraine access to billions of pounds of frozen Russian assets but No 10 said “positive progress” was made, with further talks expected on freeing up an initial £78bn to fund a loan.\n\n\n\n\nRoyals\n \n| Prince Harry’s \nUK security arrangements\n are reportedly to be reviewed after he wrote to the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, requesting a full security risk assessment.\n\n\n\n\nVenezuela\n | A US invasion or attack on Venezuela could \nplunge South America into a “Vietnam-style” conflict\n, the chief foreign policy advisor to Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has warned.\n\n\n\n\nFootball\n | \nThe former England footballer\n \nJoey Barton \nhas been sentenced to six months in custody\n, suspended for 18 months, over a series of offensive social media posts targeting pundits Lucy Ward, Eni Aluko and broadcaster Jeremy Vine.

Barton was found guilty at Liverpool court in November.\n\n\nIn depth: ‘Each time it has got bigger there’s been anxiety about the quality’\nPresident Donald Trump receives a medal as part of the Fifa peace prize.\n Photograph: Bonnie Cash/UPI/Shutterstock\nI dimly remember Argentina’s ticker-tape reception at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires in 1978 for \nthat World Cup final\n, but the first men’s Fifa World Cup that truly captured my attention was in 1982. I loved the \nPanini España 82 sticker book\n, the \nTango Espana ball\n, and the \ncute Naranjito mascot\n. It was the first time England had qualified for a World Cup finals since 1970, and their first appearance in my lifetime. \nBryan Robson scored after 27 seconds\n in their opening match against Michel Platini’s France, and I was hooked.\nI feel less hooked for next year’s event. As Paul MacInnes put it, the \nWorld Cup\n remains “the biggest show in world sport”, but that doesn’t make it immune to diminishing returns. Twelve groups means 12 top seeds, keeping bigger nations apart longer, and more teams means the larger nations will be facing much lower-ranked opposition at the group stage than in the past. “There’ll be fantastic moments, of course,” he told me, “but people tune in for the drama – and you don’t get that if half the group stage feels predictable.”\nWhy 48 teams might be an expansion too far\nIt would take a heart of stone to deny the excitement that players and fans of Cape Verde, Curaçao, Jordan and Uzbekistan are feeling as they make their World Cup debuts – Curaçao will be the smallest nation ever to appear – but there are huge questions about the expansion of the tournament.\nPaul pointed out that in Fifa’s defence, every previous expansion prompted grumbling about “diluting” the tournament, only for the football to win people over. “Each time it has got bigger there’s been anxiety about the quality and the competitiveness,” he said. “But a lot of people now would say 2022 was one of the best World Cups we’ve seen – and the final was probably the best of all.”\nForty-eight is an awkward number, though. Fifa’s original plan had been for 16 groups of three teams playing two matches each to shake it down"}

Fifa’s original plan had been for 16 groups of three teams playing two matches each to shake it down to 32, but that isn’t fair for teams who don’t compete in the last match, where participants would know what they needed to do to progress. There is a lingering shadow of the 1982 “\ndisgrace of Gijón\n”, where West Germany and Austria managed to achieve exactly the 1-0 result that saw both teams progress at the expense of Algeria.\n“There are going to be some very imbalanced fixtures,” Paul said. “You’ll see a lot of attack versus defence, a lot of low blocks and players putting their bodies on the line to stifle the creative talents people actually tune in to watch. You can almost see it as a tournament of two halves: three weeks of cagey group games and then an intense two weeks of knockout.”\nHaving more countries reach the finals has also arguably made qualifying have less jeopardy. In South America, the Conmebol qualifiers saw 10 teams play 90 matches across 18 matchdays, and only Venezuela, Peru and Chile got binned off at the end of that lengthy process.\nA very political World Cup\nSome of the most potentially awkward political flashpoints have already been avoided. Ukraine may still make the finals, but Russia is banned. Israel failed to qualify. Iran, however, will be travelling to Trump’s US – although Iranian officials threatened to boycot last week’s draw event in Washington after visa disputes.\nAnd then there is the small matter of the main host’s president – the US is staging the bulk of the matches. Paul said that while Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s public line is that he simply works with whoever is in charge, his relationship with Trump has raised eyebrows.\n“He’s been far more present in the US than in Mexico or Canada,” Paul said. “It’d be hard to say he hasn’t developed an unusually strong relationship with Trump.”\nThe US president has already taken potshots at what he calls liberal hotbed host cities such as Boston and Seattle. Paul told me it is not hard to imagine a scenario where threats are made to strip games as a political gesture – even if they never actually come to pass. “If that happens, you’re talking about huge logistical issues, legal problems and reputational damage for Fifa. But you can also imagine a lot of talk and nothing mu"}

But you can also imagine a lot of talk and nothing much changing. With Trump, both are possible.”\nTicket prices are stinging\nWhen Fifa launched the ticket sales for the tournament in October, \nmy colleague Bryan Armen Graham suggested\n that “the whole process resembled less a ticket release than a psyop to calibrate how much frustration and scarcity the public will tolerate”.\nAlongside the usual presales – including a phase where purchases could only be made by Visa – Fifa has created its own resale marketplace, ensuring it gets a cut of any tickets changing hands. Initial tickets for some group games started at around $60, top-tier seats for later games and the final soar into the thousands of dollars. Fifa is also selling \ndigital tokens\n that provide the right-to-buy tickets, but don’t appear to actually guarantee you’ll get in to see the game.\n“Fans see it as alien and highly exploitative,” he told me. “You’ve got tickets being bought and then flipped on an official platform where the prices can fluctuate again. For supporters, it doesn’t feel like a tournament ‘for all’, whatever the branding says – it feels like a case study in the increasing commercialisation of the World Cup.”\nIn New York, the issue has already become part of the city’s politics, with\n \nrecently elected mayor Zohran Mamdani demanding a cap on prices.\nEnvironmentally unfriendly\nTeams and fans will be crisscrossing a continent for weeks on end to make it to the 2026 tournament – in a situation where teams in England’s group, for example, may end up playing in Toronto in their second match and in Mexico City in a fifth. Environmental groups have raised concerns about the carbon footprint of this.\nThe environmental impact of 2030 is possibly going to be even worse, with the tournament mostly being held in Spain, Portugal and Morocco – but with extra matches tacked on in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay to mark the centenary of the first World Cup in 1930.\nBy a very lucky coincidence, hosting the 2030 men’s World Cup in Europe, South America \nand\n Africa, four years after North America hosted, meant the way was clear for petrostate Saudi Arabia to be the sole bidder for the 2034 tournament, as Fifa insists a continent must have two tournament cy"}

Just days after Cristiano Ronaldo appeared in the White House with Trump, Fifa decided to commute, to one match, his three-match ban for violent conduct after a red card against Ireland – also very luckily meaning he doesn’t have to miss Portugal’s first two group stage matches at the World Cup.\nPaul said the tweaks run deeper than disciplinary decisions. “They’ve restructured the seeding so, assuming they win their groups, the top four ranked teams – Spain, France, England and Argentina – can’t meet until the very latest stages,” he explained. “It’s being described as ‘tennis-style’, but it removes the unpredictability and the sense of equality fans associate with a World Cup.”\nThe irony, he noted, is that the famous earlier-round collisions between giants – France v Argentina in 2018, Brazil v Italy in 1982 – often produce the tournament’s defining matches. “By the time you get to the semi-finals. everyone’s exhausted and cautious,” Paul said. “The best football often comes earlier. This could backfire.”\nThere also seems to be \na tweak in the offing\n that would see the award of every corner during the World Cup subject to a VAR check. As someone who attends international and Premier League matches, and has a season ticket at Leyton Orient in League One – blissfully VAR-free – I can tell you exactly what I prefer as an in-stadium experience, and it isn’t more video refereeing every time the ball goes out.\nskip past newsletter promotion\nOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters\nPrivacy Notice: \nNewsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will watch it. There’s no question,” Paul said.\nHow they watch it may feel a little different. Late-night kick-offs, bloated group stages and long-haul travel will take some of the shine off for some supporters. I’ll confess those factors have somewhat dampened my personal enthusiasm. Previously, I’ve basically never missed a game on TV – regardless of the teams and the time zones – but the leap from watching 64 matches to watching 104 is a big one.\nThe World Cup will still have its moments of glory – but for once, I may not be there for every single one of them.\nWhat else we’ve been reading\nGolden Globes nominations (clockwise from top left) … One Battle After Another, Marty Supreme, Hamnet and Sinners.\n Composite: Warner Bros/A24/ Focus Features\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Shoard takes us through \nthe runners and riders\n of \nthe\n \nGolden Globe awards nominations\n (pictured above).

The group cited a “sharp deterioration of fundamental freedoms in the country … following a year of sweeping executive actions, restrictive laws and aggressive crackdowns on free speech and dissent.”\nThe shift comes just months after Civicus’s July assessment, which \nrated\n the US as “narrowed” – one step above “obstructed”. Civicus assigns each country a score based on civic space conditions, using five classifications: “open”, “narrowed”, “obstructed”, “repressed” and “closed”.\nAccording to the group, an “obstructed” ranking applies to countries where civic space is heavily contested. Civil society organizations still exist but state authorities undermine them including through illegal surveillance, bureaucratic harassment and demeaning public statements.\n“Citizens can organise and assemble peacefully but they are vulnerable to frequent use of excessive force by law enforcement agencies, including rubber bullets, tear gas and baton charges,” the rating description \nsaid\n.\nIt added in regards to media: “There is some space for non-state media and editorial independence, but journalists face the risk of physical attack and criminal defamation charges, which encourage self-censorship.”\nThe report cited militarized crackdowns on protests in the US, pointing to Donald Trump’s \ndeployment of the national guard \nto Los Angeles and other cities, as well as the \nwidespread use\n of ICE agents \nacross gatherings\n and \nimmigrant communities\n.\nIt further highlighted \nescalating restrictions\n on free speech across college campuses, particularly around Palestinian solidarity activism.\n“Universities have suspended student groups and opened investigations under broad and vague accusations of ‘material support for terrorism.’ Foreign-born students and faculty have been disproportionately targeted, facing disciplinary actions, visa threats, and professional retaliation for supporting Palestinian rights,” the report stated.\nCivicus moreover warned that media freedoms are under mounting pressure nationwide, citing the Federal Communications Commission’s \nthreats to revoke \nbroadcast licenses and Trump’s \nlawsuits\n against \nvarious media companies.\nIt also pointed to Trump’s \nrevocation of funding"}

This means that its loss delivers a direct blow to what remains of the Port Sudan government’s cash revenues – including fees from the transit of South Sudanese oil.\nMilitarily:\nHeglig represents the last major strategic position for the army in West/South Kordofan after the fall of el-Fasher, the capital of Darfur, and Babnusa in West Kordofan. The army’s withdrawal from the field – even if justified as being for the “protection of facilities” – reflects a shift in the balance of power in the region in favour of the RSF and their allies.\nGeopolitically:\nThe Heglig field is highly sensitive as it is part of a shared oil network with South Sudan.  And historically, it has been a point of dispute between Khartoum and Juba (the 2012 crisis being an example). Now, it has become the subject of a new contention between Sudan’s army and the RSF, with a third harmed party being the government of Juba.\nIn this sense, the fall of Heglig will raise the cost of continuing the war for the government to an unprecedented level since April 2023, as it strikes at the last “economic pillar” on which the army’s authority in the east and north could rely.\nA strategic shift, no end to the war in sight \nFrom a politico-military perspective, the effect of losing the Heglig oilfield can be read in three overlapping directions:\nFirst\n: strengthening the RSF’s ability to impose new negotiating realities. After the fall of el-Fasher in October, talk began that the RSF was working to consolidate a semi-autonomous “Darfur/Kordofan region” as a base for later pressure on Khartoum. Control of Heglig will undoubtedly give the RSF economic weight and allow its leader \nHemedti\n to claim that he controls not only territory but also a strategic resource equivalent to a “state card”.\nSecond\n: The control of Heglig restricts the army’s ability to finance its operations and maintain local loyalties, confirming that this loss"}

This now means that the army’s resources will rely on foreign support, seeking war funding and procuring weapons and equipment from abroad. In the future, Khartoum will also have to depend on internal taxation in the east and north – namely, what remains of South Sudan’s oil transit fees, if they continue. This places a major challenge before the army’s ability to sustain a long war of attrition with the same momentum.\nThird\n: The possible shift of the main battlefront between the army and the RSF to the “el-Obeid – Kadugli – Dilling” axis. Field analyses reported in recent news coverage suggest the RSF will use its momentum in Heglig to advance towards Dilling and Kadugli, and possibly Abu Jubeiha, in preparation for strangling el-Obeid. This would mean that the Battle of el-Fasher was the “battle of the west” and the Battle of Heglig could be the “gateway to the south-central battle”.\nHowever, it is important to note that holding Heglig does not mean the RSF can immediately exploit the oil, given the evacuation of the technical staff to South Sudan. The technical complexities of operating the entire pipeline mean that, for now, control is more of a disruption and pressure card than a stable production asset.\nIn the short term, the greater effect will be depriving Khartoum of revenue, not efficiently transferring it into the RSF’s coffers.\nWill the fall of Heglig force al-Burhan to negotiate?\nAll indicators suggest that the cost of continuing the war for the government is rising both economically and politically, but this does not automatically mean an immediate readiness for settlement, for the following reasons:\nThe military leadership’s discourse in Port Sudan is still based on the idea that any early settlement with the RSF would mean rewarding a “rebel militia” and possibly the end of the historical army. Therefore, the decision tends towards continuing the fighting despite the high economic cost, in the hope of greater external support or internal shifts within the opponent’s camp.\nThe army is also betting on clearer support from certain regional countries, such as"}

Meanwhile, the RSF is betting that control over territory and resources will make many capitals deal with it as a reality that cannot be ignored.\nVIDEO\nThe fall of the city of el-Fasher militarily, followed by the fall of the Heglig oilfield into RSF hands, may not yet push both sides to a serious negotiating table; rather, violations and massacres may increase. This suggests that Heglig alone will not be enough to pivot towards a settlement, but it does accelerate the exhaustion process that could make regional and international players more insistent on negotiations.\nThere is no doubt that the battle of Heglig, which was decided in the RSF’s favour, will increase economic pressure on \nGeneral Burhan’s\n government and weaken its position, but the shift towards accepting serious negotiations depends on the accumulation of such defeats combined with external pressure from sponsoring states, rather than on this single event.\nHow will the balance of power be redrawn?\nIf we place the fall of the Heglig oilfield on a timeline alongside the fall of el-Fasher, a broader picture emerges: El-Fasher was the last major army stronghold in Darfur; its fall after a siege lasting more than 500 days made it difficult to imagine the army’s return to the region in the foreseeable future, and opened the door to the emergence of a de facto entity led by the RSF.\nHuman rights reports and United Nations monitoring referred to large-scale \nmassacres\n, forced displacement, and the intensive use of drones by both sides, with attacks on medical facilities and schools.\n \nVIDEO\nThe RSF’s decisive victory in el-Fasher accelerated the shift of confrontation to Kordofan, which acts as a “bridge” between the west and the centre. The RSF’s movements in West and \nSouth Kordofan\n, allied in some areas with the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement–North (al-Hilu), have turned the region into a knot of three-way conflict: The army, the RSF, and an armed movement with a longstanding political project.\nRedrawing the map of control remains highly complex; some media reports suggest that the possibility of d"}

In this context, Heglig is not just an oil target, but a link in a project of regional expansion parallel to the central state.\nWhat is the significance of Trump’s role and his talk of “personal intervention”?\nIn recent weeks, multiple indications of the new \nUnited States\n administration’s role have emerged, stated more than once by the president, especially during his meeting at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who invited President Trump to intervene personally to help end the war in Sudan, within a four-party coordination framework (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, US).\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said Trump “is personally overseeing efforts to end the war in Sudan”, along with a warning to Sudan against allowing Russia to have a naval base on the Red Sea.\nInternational newspapers reported last week that the Sudanese government in Port Sudan offered Russia a 25‑year agreement to establish its first naval base in Africa, granting Moscow access to the Red Sea, in addition to gold mining benefits. These reports suggest that the base would give Russia a strategic foothold to monitor navigation to and from the Suez Canal, a development that worries the US, which is competing with Moscow and Beijing for military influence in Africa. In return, Sudan would receive Russian weapons and air defence systems at preferential prices to confront the RSF. However, Sudanese officials warn that the deal could expose the country to problems with Washington and the European Union. US officials and military experts believe a Russian base in Port Sudan would enhance Moscow’s ability to project power in the region and raise its international standing.\nVIDEO\nIt seems clear that President Trump’s administration will not take any decisive steps to intervene to end the war unless the Russian base project is completely frozen.

Washington sees the proposed agreement as a direct threat to its interests in the Red Sea and to its strategic superiority in global trade routes, and considers allowing Moscow a permanent foothold on Sudan’s coast as a development that shifts the balance of power in the region in favour of Russia and China.\nA new trend: war economy\nThe battle of Heglig and its surroundings reveals a more dangerous reality: The rise of the “war economy” logic in Sudan.\n \nThe RSF now control gold resources and informal trade routes, and are extending towards oil, while the army dominates ports and taxes in the east and north, and other armed movements retain local resources in their areas of influence. This fragmentation of resources deepens the model that feeds and sustains war, in which natural wealth becomes a tool of negotiation, a weapon, and a source of legitimacy. In this context, control of Heglig seems to be another step in the path of “commodifying the state” – turning oil and gold into an institutional substitute for the state itself.\nVIDEO\nEven if a ceasefire is imposed under international pressure, or an overarching political deal is reached, the persistence of these armed‑economic networks will leave Sudan vulnerable to repeated rounds of violence whenever disputes arise over revenue distribution. The state is in retreat, resources are turning into spoils, and militias are becoming parallel economic structures. Therefore, any peace path that does not fundamentally deal with the war economy – through dismantling, regulation, and restructuring – will only lead to a temporary truce preceding a new explosion.\nIn conclusion, the advance of the RSF and their control of Heglig represents a decisive turning point that deepens the imbalance of power and weakens the last pillars of the government’s economy, thereby increasing the cost of war for Khartoum and bringing closer the moment of negotiation – although the event alone is insufficient without cumulative gains on the ground and simultaneous international pressure.

In this context, the involvement of President Trump in the crisis could be a catalyst for a new negotiation track, but its success will remain dependent on his ability to support a broader internal Sudanese process that engages civilians and addresses the roots of the conflict, foremost among them dismantling the war economy that spurs the continuation of the dispute."}

While relations remain tense, the two have not been involved in a full-blown war since Trump’s return to power.\nTrump says he ended a war between Egypt and Ethiopia. But while the two nations have had tense relations, especially over a hydroelectric dam which opened on a tributary of the Nile River, they have not been in any war.\nRwanda and the DRC signed a peace deal in June, brokered by Trump. The ceasefire is fragile and tensions between the two countries remain high.

But in a subsequent interview with Fox & Friends, Trump appeared confused about the countries he had mediated between. He told his hosts that he had ended a war between Azerbaijan and Albania."}

Companies must also introduce systems to detect minors who attempt to access their services. It does not include video gaming platforms, however.\nThe measure comes after amendments to the Online Safety Act, overseen by Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, were announced last year. The government says the policy is its response to rising concerns about cyberbullying, sexual exploitation, self-harm content and mental health risks.\n \n \nWhy is Australia doing this?\nResearch commissioned by the Australian government in 2023 found four out of five children aged eight to 16 use social media, often beginning between the ages of 10 and 12. That report was led by former National Australia Bank CEO Andrew Thorburn, who recommended age restrictions.\nThe government says the ban is necessary to “keep children safe” amid rising concerns about online harms.\nThe eSafety Commissioner has also reported a sharp rise in the number of complaints related to child exploitation, cyberbullying and exposure to self-harm content in recent years.\nThe government has framed the policy as part of efforts to “lead globally” on online safety.\n How will this ban be implemented and enforced?\nThe eSafety Commissioner said it will issue specific standards that platforms wishing to operate in Australia must follow, including age-verification systems such as ID checks, which could include uploading an image of a user’s face, regular audits, and compulsory reporting on how platforms identify underage users.\nPenalties for platforms which do not comply may include fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($31.95m).

Enforcement is proving to be difficult in the days leading up to the ban.”\nLouise La Sala, senior research fellow in suicide prevention at Orygen – Australia’s National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health – said, “Ultimately, reducing online harm would be a great outcome; however, we know from evidence that ‘banning’ anything from young people won’t work on its own.”\nAaron Mackey, the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s free speech and transparency litigation director, agreed that the ban is “quite impractical to enforce at scale”, noting that some verification methods “are often inaccurate” while others “are easily circumvented”. So, while some children below 16 will get around the restrictions, some adults may find themselves mistakenly barred.\nHe added inaccuracy by biometric systems can also “discriminate against people of colour and people with disabilities”.\nWhat implications does this have for users’ privacy?\nMackey said all forms of age-gating are “a privacy nightmare that burdens the civil liberties of people both young and old”.\nHe explained that age verification, whether via ID uploads or biometrics, requires people “to share sensitive information about themselves that could then be abused or hacked”.\n“Kids are popular targets of identity theft,” he warned.\nOrlando added: “Age verification requires collecting sensitive data, including government IDs, biometrics, creating risk in terms of hackers.

For example, those using platforms for legitimate support networks, education, or creative expression lose access,” said Orlando.\nLa Sala, of Orygen, said as the ban covers only social media platforms and not video gaming, it may not work. “It’s important to recognise that harms occur on platforms not currently included in this policy. This age delay does not prevent young people from accessing content available on these platforms without an account, and we need to support young people who use these platforms to seek help or connection.\n“We also cannot forget those who are 16 and older. The platforms that they use also need to be safe. Reducing exposure to harmful content and other online harms needs to be a core element of social media use for everyone.”\nCritics also say the ban could end up harming the very children it aims to protect, as social media access can be life-saving for many young people.\n“We’ve surveyed young people and found that access to social media can be not only beneficial but life-saving to some. Censoring such access can shut off their ability to find community and engage in self-discovery, to pursue artistic education and opportunities, and to express themselves freely and receive valuable information,” Mackay told Al Jazeera.\nYoung people, he added, could become “cut off from communities and information that"}

It’s important that alternative places for support and connection are shared with these young people so that we do not risk further isolating them or cutting off important supports.”\n \n \nResearch undertaken in Australia and other countries has shown that the impact of social media on young people is complex and varies widely. Some studies link heavy use to distress and mental health problems, while others show that online platforms can provide connection and support, especially for teenagers.\nOrlando said there is no research which shows social media use directly causes mental health problems. “There is no research showing that removing social media will directly improve mental health. Instead, the research shows that social media may exacerbate existing mental health issues or exploit teenagers’ vulnerabilities.\n“Removing social media will likely help, but it will not cure mental health issues. Many factors influence these, such as cost of living issues, family breakdown, stress, as we know, mental health is impacted by many factors.”\nHowever, in Australia, studies by the eSafety Commissioner have found that children who use social media frequently are more likely to be exposed to harmful content.\nIt found that almost three in four children aged 10 to 15 have viewed content associated with harm, including hateful material, violent videos and body-image pressure.\nThe regulator has also found high levels of cyberbullying, with boys and girls saying they were targeted online in the past year.\nInternationally, organisations such as UNICEF have highlighted the benefits social media can offer.

People are required to upload proof of their age before they can view certain material deemed harmful to children.\nIn October, Denmark announced that it plans to ban children under the age of 15 from holding social media accounts. Those aged 13 and 14 would be allowed access with the permission of their parents. There is no timetable for this to take effect as yet.\nDenmark has been jointly testing an age-verification app from the European Commission alongside France, Spain, Italy, and Greece since July this year.\nIn Germany, children aged 13 to 16 are only permitted to access social media with consent from their parents. However, critics say this rule is not well enforced.\nIn France, a 2023 law requires parental consent before children under the age of 15 can obtain social media accounts, however technical challenges mean this has not been enforced yet.\nThe European Commission, Greece, Romania and New Zealand have also indicated an interest in setting a minimum age for social media use."}

Bullets whistled loudly among the guests. One bullet hit the bridesmaid in the jaw, and another hit the groom’s cousin in her shoulder. The bride’s white dress turned red — the wedding stopped before anyone danced.\nMaria, my seven-year-old sister, came running. “Sundus is sleeping on the ground and won’t wake up.”\nMum ran to the first floor, searching everywhere for Sundus, but found only a pool of blood. Her phone rang, “We are in the Baptist Hospital [al-Ahli Arab Hospital]. Come quickly,” her brother Ali said.\n“An Israeli sniper shot the child Sundus Hillis in the head,” the news circulated as we were on the way to the hospital. We knew nothing about our little one.\nWhen we arrived, Sundus was lying in a hospital bed. Blood covered her beautiful face, staining the makeup and the colourful clothes she had been overjoyed to wear.\n“Sundus, oh love. Wake up,” Mum begged her, but she only groaned weakly.\n“Two bullets in her head,” a nurse inspecting Sundus’s injury told Mum.\nTwo holes, one bullet, and some parts of the brain lost, the medical report showed.\n \n \nIn the ICU\nSundus was moved to Al-Shifa Hospital.\nBefore she entered the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the neurosurgeon tapped her right hand – she unconsciously moved it. But when he tapped her left hand and leg, nothing moved.\nSundus underwent a three-hour-long surgery and remained in the ICU. We were permitted to visit for only 15 minutes. When I first entered the room, the doctor guided me to a child with a swollen face and a bandaged head, tubes everywhere, who bore very little resemblance to my beautiful Sundus.\nOne day passed, and Sundus was still kept in the ICU until another patient in critical condition needed the bed, and she was moved to the inpatient ward.\nShe finally woke up after two days, unable to see or move the left side of her body. No matter how much I talked to her, the only response I got was loud cries.\nShe was rubbing her face, trying to look at anything but failing. “My eyes are crossed … I can’t see anything.

I used to make her draw just for a moment of quiet, but now I try to get her to speak, and she cries.\nDad, too, who used to complain, begs her to make noise, but we get nothing except: “Stop talking. My head hurts.”\n“Why have you buried me alive?” she once shouted at Mum, after agonising, futile attempts to roll over in the hospital bed.\nHung by blockade\nA few days after the surgery, Sundus was able to feel the brightness of light. She was able to see apparitions sometimes; at other times, she was unable to see at all.\nWhen she sensed the disappointment in our voices, she started guessing. That the red butterfly was blue or that the pink doll was a pink rose.\nI saw Sundus get angry at herself because she couldn’t move, then burst into tears – it’s a loop she suffers daily.\nThe neurosurgeon had no clear answers for us when we asked whether she would return to her normal self. A simple “inshallah” was his answer for all questions.\nWe had to face him several times with specific questions to get a clear answer.\n \n \n“She needs physical therapy, and it’s up to God whether she will regain her mobility or not … her vision will improve to a certain extent, but it won’t go back to how it was,” he said.\nSundus didn’t stop moaning in pain, and the hospital did not have proper resources. We had to scour the streets for painkillers and other things for her.\nOne day, I needed to find a medical cap to cover her wound – but found nothing in four pharmacies, walking through destroyed streets. Another time, I needed surgical gauze and could only find another kind, but she needed anything, urgently, so I had to buy what I found.\nI tried every international organisation to help get her out of Gaza.

Whatever the bullet damaged cannot be repaired by a surgeon,” a foreign doctor told us via messaging after he looked at Sundus’s records remotely, and our last bit of hope was shattered.\nHer condition deteriorated as the medical care was limited in the destroyed hospital. Her injury became infected and needed another surgery, in which she lost a significant amount of blood.\nIt felt like Israel shot Sundus, then used the blockade to tighten a rope around her neck.\nSundus in the wheelchair at Al-Shifa Hospital [Courtesy of Eman Hillis]\nEvading death\nFor two years, we’ve been making impossible decisions to avoid injury to anyone in the family.\nWhen Israel issued warnings to the north of Gaza, we evacuated to the south. When Israel warned of a ground operation in Khan Younis, we evacuated to Rafah.\nWhen the ground operation in Rafah was announced, we rushed to Deir el-Balah. We only returned to northern Gaza as the truce took effect in January 2025.\nWe slept in the streets, sheltered from bombs under the thin fabric of tents. For months, we endured starvation, not approaching aid drops or the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).\nBesieged Palestinians in Gaza know what harsh fate awaits them when injured.\nWe felt like we owned the land when the ceasefire took effect, feeling lucky to have lost only our home and suffered from malnutrition. Then an Israeli sniper took that relief from us.\nWhat did little Sundus do for the Israeli soldier to shoot her in the head? We are supposedly in a ceasefire.\nIronically, my friends everywhere, instead of condemning the shooting, first asked me if Sundus had been in the “yellow area” that is held by Israel.\nAll the times we nearly died while trying to stay in the “safe zone” crossed my mind as I repeated that she was not, sharing the location of the wedding hall with tens of people.\nShooting a six-year-old child is a war crime.\nHowever, it didn’t even make the headlines.\nIt was nothing out of the ordinary in Gaza.\nSundus was not lucky enough for the world to condemn her shooting or even to get proper medical care."}

The UN buffer zone covers another 235sq km (91sq miles), comparable to the size of the city of Baltimore.

It cautioned that unless these steps are enforced, education loans will not achieve the objective of widening access to higher education."}

India has been, in essence, a sophisticated assembler rather than a true manufacturer, a middleman handling the final steps of a value chain controlled from Beijing.\nThat calculus is now shifting, driven by a combination of pandemic-induced awakening, geopolitical realism, and unusually assertive industrial policy. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes launched by the Department of Pharmaceuticals represent the most ambitious attempt in a generation to restructure India's pharmaceutical supply chain from the ground up.\n \nIsraeli Firm IWI Backs 'Make-In-India', In Talks To Bring ARBEL Rifle System To India\n \nThe numbers are striking. Under the PLI scheme for bulk drugs alone, manufacturers have invested Rs 4,763 crore in greenfield projects over three and a half years, exceeding the six-year commitment of Rs 4,329 crore. \nProduction capacity now exists for twenty-six key starting materials and drug intermediates that were previously almost entirely imported. The broader pharmaceutical PLI scheme has drawn cumulative investment of Rs 40,890 crore, vastly surpassing the Rs 17,275 crore originally targeted. Some 726 APIs and intermediates are now being manufactured domestically, including 191 produced in India for the first time. The import substitution is quantifiable: Rs 1,807 crore in avoided imports under the bulk drugs scheme through September 2025, with cumulative domestic sales reaching Rs 26,123 crore across both programs.\nWhat makes this moment genuinely different from previous self-reliance campaigns is the infrastructure accompanying the incentives. Three bulk drug parks are under development in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Himachal Pradesh, each supported by up to Rs 1,000 crore in central funding for common infrastructure, effluent treatment plants, solvent recovery systems, warehouses, and utilities. State governments are layering additional subsidies: capital assistance, GST reimbursements, concessional land. The aim is to compress the cost structure that has historically made d"}

State governments are layering additional subsidies: capital assistance, GST reimbursements, concessional land. The aim is to compress the cost structure that has historically made domestic API production uncompetitive against Chinese facilities operating with fully amortized capital and generous state support.\nThe strategic logic is sound. COVID-19 exposed pharmaceutical supply chains as fragile in ways that proved impossible to ignore. When China's Hubei province locked down in early 2020, Indian drug manufacturers faced immediate shortages of critical intermediates. The lesson was brutally simple: dependence on a single source for essential inputs is not merely an economic risk but a public health vulnerability. American and European policymakers have drawn identical conclusions, with the U.S. BIOSECURE Act targeting Chinese contract manufacturers and the EU Critical Medicines Alliance funding supply chain resilience initiatives across member states.\nIndia's opportunity lies precisely in this global reordering. Western pharmaceutical companies and governments are actively seeking alternatives to Chinese suppliers, not out of geopolitical spite, but from rational diversification. India possesses the technical workforce, the regulatory familiarity with developed markets, and now the industrial policy framework to capture this demand. The excipients market tells a parallel story: Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing region through 2034, with Indian manufacturers increasingly positioned to serve both domestic formulation and export demand.\nChallenges remain substantial. Land acquisition, environmental clearances, and subsidy disbursement delays have slowed progress at several facilities. Not all targeted intermediates have achieved import substitution, particularly in fermentation-based products where Chinese scale advantages remain formidable. The global cost gap will not close through incentives alone; it requires sustained investment in process technology, workforce development, and the kind of operational discipline that distinguishes pharmaceutical manufacturing from commodity chemical production.\nBut the trajectory is unmistakable. India's pharmaceutical sector, valued at approximately $67 billion in 2025, is projected to reach $174 billion by 2033. More importantly, an increasing share of that value will be captured dom"}

More importantly, an increasing share of that value will be captured domestically rather than remitted to Chinese suppliers of basic inputs. The country that has long dispensed the world's medicines is finally building the capacity to manufacture them, from the first molecular building blocks to the finished tablets and vials.\nThis is not merely an economic story. It is a strategic repositioning with implications for global health security. In a world where supply chains have become instruments of statecraft, India's pharmaceutical self-reliance is not nationalism dressed in industrial policy. It is prudence."}

What has been missing is early support that turns strong research into venture-ready proof, so that more deep-tech ideas can become investable companies.

We want to meet the researchers pushing boundaries of the frontier and give them a fast and credible on-ramp to real-world impact.” \nSDEX will support researchers through equity-free fellowship funding and milestone-driven technical sprints, helping promising frontier technologies cross the gap between lab validation and venture readiness. \nAvijeet Alagathi, partner, Shastra VC, added, “India’s deep-tech ecosystem is coming of age. Universities, incubators, and national programs are making it easier than ever for research to move from lab to market, and the policy momentum in recent years shows real intent to build global frontier-tech leadership.

It was one of the lowest for the winter season recorded so far this year.\nStreets appeared deserted for a longer duration, and early-morning walkers were relatively fewer on roads and at parks; those braving the chilly weather were fully covered in warm clothing such as woollen fur caps and hoodies for protection against the biting cold. In Mysuru city, the usual early-morning walkers at Kukkarahalli Lake, Manasagangotri campus, and Chamundi foothills moved at a brisker pace to beat the cold. Light fog hovered in open stretches.\nThe drop in temperature on Tuesday was a continuation of the chilly conditions that Mysuru and surrounding regions have been experiencing for the last few days, especially during the early part of the day and again at night.\nResidents of Mysuru and the rural hinterland have been observing a noticeable chill before sunrise for the last few days but it dipped to a new low on Tuesday. The sun broke out by 9 a.m. and there was searing heat by noon. But the temperature dropped again late in the evening.\nOfficials noted that while variations between districts are normal, the overall pattern points to a steady fall in temperature across districts.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 06:20 pm IST"}

But by noon on polling day, that well-set narrative was blown off course. And all it took was one offhand remark from United Democratic Front (UDF) convener Adoor Prakash.\nAfter casting his vote in Pathanamthitta on Tuesday morning, Mr. Prakash declared to mediapersons that actor Dileep had “finally been served justice,” adding that he was personally happy about it. Within minutes, the comment detonated across the political landscape. The Left Democratic Front seized it with both hands, converting it into fresh ammunition to revive an old attack line that the Congress harbours an anti-women streak. And it  wasted no time tying it to the rape allegations against Rahul Mamkootathil MLA.\nLDF heavyweights Veena George and V.N. Vasavan led the charge, turning the remark into a poll-day weapon.  Ms. George called Mr. Prakash’s words a “clear reflection” of anti-women stance long harboured by the Congress, while Mr. Vasavan accused the UDF of adopting the same soft-corner approach in the case against the Palakkad legislator.\nFor the Congress, the timing could not have been worse. Leaders were initially stunned, unsure how to contain the political fire spiralling out of control. Soon they were scrambling to downplay the remark, while quietly seething at the strategic blunder. The party was counting on polling day to take the Sabarimala gold scandal narrative to its peak. Instead, an off-the-cuff comment hijacked the carefully planned messaging.\n“This remark came at the most inopportune moment,” fumed a senior Congress leader, lamenting how a “golden opportunity” was squandered just when the UDF needed maximum momentum.\nSensing the danger, veteran leader Ramesh Chennithala attempted damage control from Alappuzha, trying to pull public attention back to the Sabarimala gold scam. But insiders admit it was far from clear whether he succeeded in neutralising the blow.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 06:19 pm IST"}

Chidambaram, has approached the Madras High Court challenging the attachment of ₹90.08 lakh, from two of his bank accounts, by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) in connection with a money laundering probe initiated on the basis of the Aircel-Maxis deal by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\nFirst Division Bench of Chief Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava and Justice G. Arul Murugan admitted an appeal preferred by the MP against a June 5, 2025, order passed by the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA) Appellate Tribunal in New Delhi, which also deals with statutory appeals under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\nThe civil miscellaneous appeal, in the nature of a second appeal, was entertained after hearing senior counsel Vijay Narayan, assisted by advocate N.R.R. Arun Natarajan, for the MP; ED Special Public Prosecutor N. Ramesh was permitted to take notice on behalf of the agency. The Division Bench gave three weeks’ time for the ED to file its reply, and adjourned the hearing thereafter.\nThe CBI probe\nThe court was informed that the CBI had registered the First Information Report (FIR) in the Aircel-Maxis case on October 9, 2011, for offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act. The charge was related to a 2005 deal, which emanated from Malaysia-based Maxis Deal Communications for a 100% takeover of India-based telecommunications operator Aircel Limited.\nA charge-sheet was filed on August 29, 2014, against former Union Telecommunication Minister Dayanidhi Maran, his elder brother and Sun TV Network head Kalanithi Maran, and a few others. However, on February 2, 2017, a special court in New Delhi discharged the Maran brothers and two others from the CBI’s case as well as the consequent PMLA case registered by the ED on February 7, 2012.\nSubsequently, both the CBI and ED challenged the discharge by filing criminal revision petitions before the Delhi High Court, which, on May 19, 2017, refused to stay the discharge order. The ED on July 18, 2017, went on appeal to the Supreme Court where the proceedings were still pending. In the meantime, the ED’s investigation revealed the involvement of various individuals who had not been named in the CBI’s charge-sheet.\nAttachment or"}

In the meantime, the ED’s investigation revealed the involvement of various individuals who had not been named in the CBI’s charge-sheet.\nAttachment order\nTherefore, it passed a provisional attachment order on September 23, 2017, attaching ₹90.08 lakh from two bank accounts of Mr. Karti Chidambaram and another ₹26 lakh from the bank account of Advantage Strategic Consulting Private Limited. The provisional order was referred to the Adjudicating Authority, under the PMLA, for confirmation, and it was confirmed on March 12, 2018, after due hearing.\nMr. Karti Chidambaram challenged the confirmation order before the SAFEMA Appellate Tribunal on the ground that he was not named in the CBI’s charge-sheet and that even the ED had not completed its probe and filed a prosecution complaint (similar to a charge-sheet) against him when the provisional attachment order was passed. He pointed out that the prosecution complaint against him was filed only on June 13, 2019.\nHe also argued that the ED ought to have filed the prosecution complaint at least within 90 days from the date of passing of the provisional order. However, his arguments did not cut ice with the SAFEMA Appellate Tribunal, which concluded that the ED was entitled to attach properties of individuals even during the course of investigation, even if they had not been named in the predicate offence.\nThe New Delhi-based appellate tribunal arrived at such a conclusion on the basis of Supreme Court’s 2022 judgment in VIjay Madanlal Choudhary’s case (considered an authority on PMLA) and hence, the present appeal before the Madras High Court.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 05:43 pm IST"}

Will an app decide who will be my relative? My brother is not my relative, my wife is not my relative?” he asked, calling the exercise arbitrary.\nThe purpose of the system should be inclusion, but “SIR is only meant to delete electors”, the four-time MP from Serampore in West Bengal said. Mr. Banerjee also claimed that excessive workload given to \nthe  Booth Level Officers (BLOs) in West Bengal\n led to a series of tragedies.\n“In West Bengal, 20 persons died, five fell critically ill, 19 persons expired, and three attempted to end their lives,” Mr. Banerjee claimed, asking, “Who will be responsible? The Election Commission?” He added that these incidents were not confined to Bengal alone and pointed to similar cases in other States.\nCiting figures, he said Uttar Pradesh reported 10 such cases, Madhya Pradesh nine, Gujarat six, and Rajasthan three. Kerala had one case, and Tamil Nadu had two, Mr. Banerjee said, arguing that the problem spanned both BJP- and non-BJP-ruled States.\n“Three are non-BJP and five are BJP States,” he said, adding that while the BJP MPs did not visit the affected families, “we had gone”. \n Published \n- December 09, 2025 05:11 pm"}

Mani on Tuesday (December 9, 2025) said that the recent \nDelhi High Court verdict\n had been in favour of PMK founder S. Ramadoss, and the \nrival faction led by Anbumani Ramadoss\n had “nothing to do with the party.” \nSpeaking to reporters at Thailapuram near Tindivanam, Mr. Mani said that the founder would continue to lead the party, decide on alliances for the upcoming Assembly elections, and also get its recognition and symbol. He appealed to all PMK cadres, including those who had joined the rival camp, to “follow the path of truth and justice.”\nMr. Mani said that the party will get the ‘mango’ symbol back and contest the elections under it. Pointing out that the High Court verdict had brought to light the irregularities by the Election Commission of India (ECI), he said that Mr. Anbumani-led faction had misrepresented facts before the Commission. He said that Mr. Anbumani’s tenure was limited to three years and expired in May 2025, but he purportedly submitted forged documents claiming that a general council meeting held in 2023 was actually the one convened in 2022, thereby extending his term until 2026. \nReferring to the communication sent by the ECI to Mr. Anbumani’s address in Chennai, Mr. Mani said that it was only a change of address due to misrepresented facts, and that the party would take up the issue. \nHe also called upon the ECI to ”remain neutral and vigilant” and not indulge in betrayal against any party, as was done “in the case of the PMK.” The ECI had erred in recognising Mr. Anbumani, and the faction led by Mr. Ramadoss represented the PMK, he added. \n Published \n- December 09, 2025 04:30 pm IST"}

He accused the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of “brutally attacking” the project. “People today need a system that enables high speed travel. SilverLine was a development proposal to address that need. The UDF, BJP, and certain extremist organisations, however, tried to obstruct it. The Union government supported their attempt,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said. \nMeanwhile, the LDF convener also claimed that the Railway Ministry has come up with a new proposal for enhancing rail connectivity in the State. “It is slightly different from the SilverLine project. The government will take a pragmatic and practical decision on it,” he said, while refusing to divulge more details. \nHowever, former BJP State president K.

This was shared at a panel discussion titled ‘\nExperience Telangana: Heritage, Culture and Future-Ready Tourism’\n at Telangana Rising Global Summit-2025, Bharat Future City on Tuesday (December 9, 2025).\nTourism Minister Jupally Krishna Rao said tourism must emerge as a key driver of Telangana’s economic growth as the State works towards contributing to India’s ₹3 trillion dollar economic vision by 2047. Pointing to international examples where tourism powers economies despite limited natural resources, he said Telangana must approach the sector with similar ambition.\n“Telangana possesses forts, monuments, temples and natural landscapes that even residents of the State are not fully familiar with. Tourism is not simply recreation but a way to deepen cultural awareness,” the Minister said while urging the hospitality sector to expand accommodation options, including mid-range and portable facilities, so tourists can stay longer instead of making hurried day trips due to insufficient infrastructure.\nHe said the government has created an advisory board for tourism and culture and introduced a \ntourism policy\n offering incentives for private investments. The State also plans to unlock numerous unused Telangana Tourism Development Corporation properties \nthrough partnerships that improve visitor amenities and generate revenue.\nManaging Director of Telangana Tourism Development Corporation (TGTDC), Valluru Kranthi, said each tourism cluster will be designed to offer 10 to 15 unique activities within a 100 kilometre radius, ensuring that tourists encounter nature, culture, cuisine and crafts as part of a single integrated itinerary.\nExplaining the model, she said clusters such as Nirmal will allow visitors to explore waterfalls like Kuntala and Pochera in nearby Adilabad, undertake jungle safaris in Jannaram, go boating at Kadam and interact with Nirmal artisans famous for their handicrafts and paintings.

The objective is to create comprehensive regional development by integrating handloom, handicrafts, cuisine and nature-based attractions into a unified experience,” said Ms Kranthi.\nMinister for Forest, Environment and Endowments Konda Surekha said the government views forests, environment and ecotourism as central to building a sustainable, inclusive and globally competitive Telangana.\n“Telangana currently has 13 ecotourism circuits and heritage sites such as Ramappa and Srisailam, which are being linked with nature-based tourism. Tiger numbers at Amrabad have increased to 36 in 2024, which reflects the strong efforts of forest and wildlife protection teams. New ecotourism destinations including Nandipet, Tadwai and Pakal are being developed with guided treks and enhanced amenities. Four temple tourism circuits connecting Jogulamba, Maniamkonda, Yadadri, Ramappa, Bhadrachalam, Vemulawada, Basara and other historic shrines are being prepared as part of Vision 2047,” she said.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 03:09 pm IST"}

We lounge on \ncharpoys\n, strolled along the island’s edge, or simply watch the sun descend and the moon rise. I catch the crackle of something frying in oil — the unmistakable aroma of fresh fish. The menu is simple and satisfying: crisp \nmach bhaja\n (fish fry) for non-vegetarians and hot \npakoras\n for vegetarians. The fish, small and locally caught, are marinated in salt and turmeric, then deep-fried to golden perfection.\nThe staff also pull out tins of \njhal muri\n, serving it in paper cones. A couple of cups of tea later, a few guests stepped out to admire the night sky. As we eat, we star gaze: with no city lights to compete with, constellations shine bright. Dinner too is simple but tasty: masala mushroom curry, odiya dal (dalma) and chicken curry, all cooked by the team of the Forest Department.  \n\n\n                            Herd of Bison\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                Special Arrangement\n                                                    \nI wake up early the next day to walk, accompanied by peahens and geese. With no mobile network at Debrigarh, nature becomes your only connection. What stands out are the anthills — some nearly six feet tall. No two look alike, their rampart-like structures giving them a sculptural beauty. I head towards the lake where yoga enthusiasts are deep in their morning routine and bask in the soft winter sun. \nLike most wildlife sanctuaries, Debrigarh has a fleet of safari jeeps, driven and managed by forest staff who are trained locals from the tribes that live here. The seven-kilometre drive to enter the safari area tests my back: but on the bright side, we spot sambar deer, Indian bison, peacocks, and wild boars.

These communities were Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians. Section 6B of the CAA allows these persons to apply for grant of certificate of registration or certificate of naturalisation. The NGO argued that those who apply for naturalisation should not be deprived of citizens’ rights and privileges.\nHowever, the petition said the authorities have delayed the issuance of the citizenship certificates. This, coupled with the non-recognition of acknowledgment receipts during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR), has created a serious constitutional crisis. \n“The affected persons, already recognised by Parliament as persecuted minorities of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who entered India deserving protection and integration, are now exposed to the risk of statelessness, social exclusion and disenfranchisement,” the petition alleged. \nBut Chief Justice Kant said the conferment of Indian citizenship was not a given for these applicants.

The EC did periodic review of the electoral roll, and could include the eligible names. \nThe Court however issued notice to the EC, the Centre, the State Election Commission of West Bengal, and sought a response.

This was the fourth bomb threat sent to the High Court in the last 40 days. The earlier threats were received through emails on October 31 and December 5 and 8.\nFollowing the alert, the bomb disposal squad, quick response team and dog squad from the Jaipur Police Commissionerate reached the court. The court premises were completely evacuated, and an intensive search operation was carried out in the courtrooms, corridors, lawyers’ chambers, parking area and the administrative section.\nThe hearing of cases in all courtrooms was suspended and the judges, lawyers and litigants were shifted out of the building. “Such repeated threats disrupt judicial proceedings and delay hearings, which affects the disposal of cases. It adversely affects the efficiency of our judicial system which is already stretched,” lawyer Javed Chaudhary said.\nAll the threats received earlier had turned out to be a hoax. Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime) Manish Agarwal, who led the search operation, said the threats were sent to “create panic”, but no suspicious object was found on the court premises.\nMr. Agarwal said while efforts were underway with technical inputs to trace those who had sent the emails, the security arrangement on the court premises would be strengthened with intensive checking, entry inspections and a better surveillance system. \n Published \n- December 09, 2025 02:47 pm IST"}

In the case of distributing substandard material, show-cause notices were sent to 3,811 firms, as many as 1,437 licences were cancelled and 65 FIRs filed.\n The Minister also informed that in case of diversion, there were 3,058 show-cause notices, 464 licence cancellations and 96 FIRs.\n \"If I talk about show-cause notices in the past 7 months, it is 12,814, and 5,835 licences were cancelled and 649 FIRs lodged. Out of this, 442 FIRs have been lodged on black marketing,\" Mr. Nadda said.\n The Minister said that the Centre has supplied fertilisers to every State and the supplies are monitored in real time through Integrated Fertiliser Monitoring System.\n \"Although we also know that the fertilizer is being diverted, it is also a known fact that the dealers are hoarding which has to be taken care of by the State government. But as far as the material is concerned, the fertilizer is concerned, they have reached on time everywhere,\" Mr. Nadda said.\n He said a farmer may have capacity to use 10 bags but he takes away 50 bags which needs to be taken care of and the state government needs to provide support to the Centre in handling it.\n In second supplementary, BJP member Choudhary said the government should take note that farmers are forced to buy additional products beyond fertilisers which create a financial crisis for them and called for firming up a standard protocol"}

I will give a voice to the people of Puducherry too,“ he said.\nThough Tamil Nadu and Puducherry may be geographically separated, he said the people of both regions are united on many fronts. “The Central government may consider both as separate entities, but I consider them as one. We are together and united,” he said.\nThe UT, he said, was confronted with several governance issues, such as the long-pending demand for Statehood, inclusion of the territory under the ambit of Finance Commission recommendations, lack of IT parks, closure of textile mills, lack of potable drinking water supply, and frequent arrests of Karaikal fishermen by Sri Lankan authorities.\nWatch: Vijay to address TVK cadre meet in Puducherry amid tight security\n                                    \nStrongly advocating for Statehood for Puducherry, the TVK chief said the Central government has not accorded the status despite the Assembly passing several resolutions. \nA Minister was removed from the Puducherry Cabinet and another MLA was inducted into the Ministry.

Hope they (the DMK government) will learn from this decision. But they will not. I am 100% sure that the people of Tamil Nadu will make them learn in the 2026 polls,” he said. Urging the public not to trust the DMK, he said “they (the DMK) will try to make you believe, but in the end, will cheat you.” \nScare at the venue\nA large crowd gathered for the meeting, which was held under tight crowd control measures at the Uppalam Ground. Mr. Vijay, who reached Puducherry on Monday (December 8) night, arrived at the venue in his campaign vehicle at around 10.30 a.m.\nWith the police having restricted the number of attendees to around 5,000, only TVK workers who were issued QR-code passes by the party were allowed inside the venue after security frisking.\nDuring the security screening, a pistol was recovered from a person at the entrance of the venue. The police identified the person as David. As per the information provided by him to the police, he is an ex-serviceman and one of the personal guards of Sivagangai District Secretary of the TVK, Prabhu. \nThe police have taken him to the Odiansalai police station for questioning. “We are checking his credentials and the veracity of his claim of possessing a licence for the gun,” said a police officer.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 11:31 am IST"}

Voters will give a fitting reply to the Opposition’s inherently misogynistic stance. The Congress continued to shield Palakkad MLA Rahul Mamkootathil, who is facing multiple charges of rape”, he said.\nMr Viswam claimed that, in stark contrast, the LDF is at the forefront of the survivors’ fight for justice. “The Left will not bow to the arrogance and financial heft of sexual predators”, he added. \nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] general secretary M. A. Baby stated that the LDF would leave no stone unturned to protect survivors and ensure justice. \nV.

It led to the mandatory constitution of internal complaints committees in the film and entertainment industry. The case emboldened survivors to speak out and seek justice”, he added. \nMr Rajeeve said the trial court had convicted those directly involved in the crime. The special investigation team (SIT), which probed the case, contended that the crime was the end product of an entrenched conspiracy.\nHowever, the court found the SIT’s evidence wanting. “It’s obligatory for the State side to go on appeal. Moreover, the survivor also desires such a legal move”, he added. \nCongress leader K. Muraleedharan said the survivor had the right to appeal the trial court’s verdict if she felt aggrieved. “There is no verdict that satisfies all parties. It’s the State’s prerogative to go on appeal. It is not advisable to mix politics into the debate”, he added. \nEarlier, senior Congress leader and former Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala had dismissed Mr Prakash’s statement as a “personal opinion”.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 11:11 am IST"}

It fears that the BJP might supplant the Congress in several seats and supersede the UDF in the next council. \nKochi Corporation\nThe Kochi Corporation is another key battleground where no side can claim an upper hand. The LDF had seized governance through clever political jugglery despite not having a clear majority in 2020. Congress rebels aided the LDF. The UDF feels it has a fighting chance, but it fears the NDA might steal a section of anti-government votes. \nIn Kottayam, the NDA’s attempt to woo the Christian heartland of central Kerala poses a threat to both traditional fronts. The electoral battle in the district is a matchup between various Kerala Congress parties and their splinter groups, each owing allegiance to opposing alliances. \nCaste and religious demographics may affect the outcome of the Thiruvalla Municipality elections in Pathanamthitta district, home to the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. The UDF has the upper hand in the current council and is fighting to defend its fort against threats from the LDF and NDA. \nThe LDF’s confidence in Kollam rests on its past laurels. It has ruled the corporation for more than two decades and won nearly 42 per cent of the vote share in the 2020 local body polls, with the Congress coming close behind, garnering almost 31 per cent. The NDA, not to be left behind, is seeking to improve its vote share from 22 per cent in 2020. \nMainstream political parties in Tamil Nadu, chiefly the AIADMK and the DMK, have a decisive say in the local body polls in Idukki, given that Tamil voters dominate Peerumade, Udumbanchola and Devikulam Assembly constituencies.

A combination of factors, such as the factional feud within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)], formation of the Revolutionary Marxist Party, and the anti-incumbency against the then Left Democratic Front (LDF) government were cited as possible reasons for this scenario. It was claimed that the LDF could retain power in the corporation council only because Beypore, Elathur, and Cheruvannur-Nallalam grama panchayats were added to its jurisdiction.\nFronts hope for a repeat\nWhile the UDF is hoping to repeat the 2010 performance in a better way and usurp power across all local bodies in the district, the LDF is confident of improving its tally in the 2020 polls. In the elections held five years ago, the LDF had won 18 seats in the 27-member district panchayat. In the 75-member Kozhikode Corporation council, it won 51 seats, while the UDF was reduced to 17 and NDA seven. In the 12 block panchayats, the LDF came to power in 10 and the UDF two. Of the 70 grama panchayats, it had a majority in 42. However, the UDF had an upper hand in the municipality elections, as it won Feroke, Ramanattukara, Koduvally, and Payyoli while the LDF could come to power only in Vadakara, and Koyilandy. In Mukkom, the LDF assumed office later with the support of an Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) rebel.\nThis time, the LDF’s confidence stems from its well-oiled machinery and the State government’s development initiatives and social security schemes. The UDF’s “tie-up” with the Jamaat-e-Islami backed Welfare Party of India and the charges of sexual misconduct against Palakkad MLA Rahul Mamkootathil are the other key issues highlighted in its campaign.\nThe UDF, meanwhile, is banking heavily on a perceived anti-incumbency feeling against the government, the gold theft case at the Sabarimala Temple, and the hike in taxes collected by the local bodies.

This time, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is fighting to retain its dominance in Thrissur. The United Democratic Front (UDF) is attempting a comeback after two successive setbacks. And the National Democratic Alliance, buoyed by Suresh Gopi’s emphatic Lok Sabha victory, is hoping to convert momentum into seats.\nThrissur, the cultural capital of Kerala with deep political roots, comprises 86 grama panchayats, one Corporation, seven municipalities and 16 block panchayats. Historically, the UDF has had a strong presence here — especially in the city. But over the last decade, Thrissur’s political wind drifted towards Left. Group feuds and rebel trouble crippled the UDF in consecutive elections. This time, with smooth candidate selection and fewer internal fissures, the front senses a chance to regain lost ground.\nPast record\nIn 2020, the LDF transformed Thrissur into its fortress — winning 69 of 86 grama panchayats, 13 of 16 block panchayats and 24 of 29 district panchayat divisions. The front also secured five of the seven municipalities. It was a massive sweep.\nThe Corporation, however, remained a cliffhanger. Both fronts secured 24 seats each in the 55-member council, while the BJP won 6. The LDF formed the council only with the support of a UDF rebel — M.K. Varghese — who was rewarded with the Mayor’s post. The UDF had missed majority by just one seat.\nObviously, the Corporation witnessing toughest fight. This time, the LDF hopes for a third straight term.  The UDF is determined to break the streak. The NDA, riding high on its parliamentary performance, is eyeing gains in the 36 divisions where Suresh Gopi led convincingly. \nAn unpredictable electorate\nAs campaigns enter the final stretch, Thrissur’s voters remain inscrutable. Political observers see no wave — neither the Left nor the Right — only an electorate that keeps every front guessing. \nThe LDF, with its ten-year governance record in both State and Corporation, projects development, welfare, and continuity as its core pitch. The UDF counters with sharp anti-incumbency claims, calling the last decade “a period of stagnation” marked by failed infrastructure and deteriorating services.\nThe Rahul Mamkootathil controversy, the Sabarimala gold theft, and the pitiable condition of national highway are visible talking points.

Minority votes — 35% Christian and 16% Muslim — are decisive. The district’s two powerful Catholic dioceses shape outcomes in Thrissur, Irinjalakuda, Ollur and Chalakudy. The coastal belt adds a significant Muslim share. Getting this arithmetic right is crucial for every front.\nA district that defies predictions\nIf numbers once suggested an LDF fortress, the 2024 Lok Sabha election shattered assumptions. Whether that momentum will unsettle the existing political equations remains uncertain. What is clear, however, is that Thrissur refuses to be read easily. Its voters shift, surprise, and rewrite predictions — every time.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 10:32 am IST"}

The Congress-led UDF coalition governs 16 of the 23 grama panchayats and two of the three municipalities — Mananthavady and Kalpetta. \nThe Mananthavady grama panchayat had remained a stronghold of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) throughout its history, including during its first term as a municipality from 2015. The LDF, however, lost power in 2020. The Kalpetta and Sulthan Bathery municipalities have also traditionally leaned towards the Left, though the shifting political fortunes of the Janata Dal (Secular) influenced the final outcome in Kalpetta.\nThe LDF and the UDF are evenly matched in the block panchayats, each controlling two, while both fronts hold eight seats each in the district panchayat, with the UDF securing the president’s post through a draw of lot.\nAs home to the fewest local bodies, when Wayanad prepares for the elections, the UDF draws confidence from trends in the Lok Sabha and the Assembly polls. Of the three Assembly constituencies in the district, Kalpetta (T. Siddique) and Sulthan Bathery (I.C. Balakrishnan) are represented by Congress MLAs and O.R. Kelu of the LDF holds Mananthavady.\nLocal dynamics\nThe LDF hopes to capitalise on local dynamics, including factional disputes and rebel candidates within the Congress.

Still, the BJP leaders insist they are aiming for a third consecutive term in Palakkad.\nThe BJP’s claim may hold weight, especially given the troubles within the Congress. While the Congress insists its house is intact and stronger than last year, concerns linger that the Rahul Mamkootathil issue could hurt its prospects.\nBut the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] appears stagnant in Palakkad. If it loses a seat or two compared to last year, the Congress may argue that the Rahul Mamkootathil issue had no impact at all.\nReaching the magic number of 27 seats will be tough for both the BJP and the United Democratic Front (UDF). BJP sources predict a haul of 20–24 seats, while the UDF insiders claim they too can secure at least 20.\nRebel candidates\nAnticipating a tight contest, both the BJP and the UDF have ramped up campaigns across several wards.

Over the past five years, both the dioceses have actively staged protests on issues ranging from human-animal conflicts to buffer zone disputes. While the Idukki diocese openly supported Left Democratic Front-backed Independent candidate Joice George in the 2014 parliamentary election, it maintained a neutral stance in the subsequent polls, focussing instead on people-centric issues.\nIdukki diocese media commission director Fr. Jins Karakkatt says the Church is impartial towards political fronts in the State. “Currently, the political landscape in the State is witnessing various controversies. The media often fail to address the real issues affecting people. Some news channels are even working as a tool for political parties and creating controversies,” he says.\n“We will support those local body candidates who address people’s issues in the district,” adds the priest.\nCommenting on the farmers’ concerns in Idukki, Fr. Karakkatt says: “The farming community in the district is suffering from recurring wild animal attacks and other land issues. We will support those who\nstand with the farmers and\naddress their concerns. The local body representatives are capable of positive intervention in this matter.”\nOn Forest dept.\nKothamangalam diocese chancellor Fr. Jose Kulathur says the stance of the Forest department ais a major concern being highlighted during the polls. “The Forest department is functioning like a parallel government and is\nhindering the normal life of people. The local body leaders can help prevent their ‘illegal’ actions,” says Fr. Kulathur.\n“Due to the absence of sufficient job opportunities and facilities, the new generation is migrating to other countries. In the next 20 years, most villages in the district will be in an abandoned state. By providing more jobs here, the government can help prevent this,” he adds.\n Published \n- December 09, 2025 10:30 am IST"}

The pre-poll survey indicated an advantage for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation. After her Facebook post became a controversy, it was removed from her page.\nGeneral Education Minister V. Sivankutty said that Ms. Sreelekha’s action is a violation of the model code of conduct. “Her conduct reflects her lack of knowledge in the political field. The authorities have to look into the poll code violation,” he said.\nEarlier, during the campaigning phase, Ms. Sreelekha, former Director General of Police (DGP), had faced criticism over the use of the ‘IPS’ tag in her posters and campaign materials. The tag was removed in some posters, while in others it was changed to ‘IPS (Retired)’. \n Published \n- December 09, 2025 10:28 am IST"}
