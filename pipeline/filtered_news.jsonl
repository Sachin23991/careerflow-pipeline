There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

Out of 720 marks, a massive 360 marks come from Biology alone. That’s half the paper, making it the most decisive and scoring subject in the exam. But here’s the truth: Biology isn’t just about memorising lines from a textbook. It’s about understanding life itself. And when you truly understand it, cracking NEET becomes much easier. NEET UG 2026 Physics Preparation Tips to Score 180 Marks Biology beautifully unfolds into two fascinating branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany lets you explore the world of plants, their structure, diversity, colours, and the incredible processes that keep our environment balanced. It helps you understand how genes pass from one generation to another and how biotechnology enhances human life. NEET UG 2026 Chemistry Preparation Tips Zoology brings you closer to the inner workings of living beings, such as respiration, blood circulation, and reproduction. It’s a deep dive into how the human body maintains harmony every single second. Together, these branches not only help you score well but also allow you to appreciate how life thrives in every form around you. If you want to master NEET Biology, strategy matters as much as study hours. Here’s how you can prepare smartly: –Make NCERT your foundation. It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly. Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly.

In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts. The ruling lifted all legal barriers and gave RRBs a clear path to conduct the exam.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763619678.3539152}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do.

This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process. The 2021 board exams were significantly delayed, starting on May 17 and ending on May 26. This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years. By 2023, the Telangana SSC exams returned closer to the usual time frame, being held from April 3 to April 13. The shorter, 11-day window helped the board align future sessions with the pre-pandemic calendar. The 2024 exams were conducted from March 18 to April 2, indicating a complete return to the standard March schedule. The examination period stretched over 16 days, giving students a familiar timetable after several disrupted years. For the 2025 session, the exams began on March 21 and concluded on April 4, continuing the trend of mid-March starts and early April endings.

The draft curriculum, which has been submitted to the NCERT for review, provides a structure for schools to introduce computational thinking and AI in a phased and progressive manner from classes 3 to 12.

European and East Asian universities are also in negotiations,” he said. As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared. Recognising that reading lengthy passages on screens differs from paper, test-makers deliberately reduced passage lengths.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763619694.271933}

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete. Germany’s medical qualification, the Staatsexamen is a six-year program conducted in German, requiring at least C1-level proficiency in the language. The curriculum combines rigorous academic study with clinical exposure at university-affiliated hospitals.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic.

My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it.

After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Seven IITs, which feature in the top 10 among Indian institutions in the QS Asia Rankings 2026, have seen a significant fall in their ranks this year compared to last year.

READ MORE| India’s top IITs rank slip as universities from China, Singapore surge ahead in QS Asia Rankings 2026 The ranking of Asian universities, released on Tuesday, reflects an eastward concentration of top performance, QS said. Indian institutions retain strong reputations but face stiff competition from those in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, which are outperforming them on metrics like ‘citations per paper’, which is a measure of the impact of research, faculty-student ratio, and international student ratio. Reacting to the rankings, Prof Chakraborty said: “The QS rankings are one of several reference points in a very broad and complex global higher education ecosystem. A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/qs-world-rankings-asia-universities-2026-ranks-indian-institutes-drop-rank-iit-kharagpur-director-reacts-suman-chakraborty-10347239/", "timestamp": 1763619698.936445}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Canada’s immigration department said it has ramped up fraud detection efforts after uncovering over 1,550 fake study permit applications in 2023, most linked to forged acceptance letters from Indian agents.

According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts.

This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure.

An “infamous mystery hacker” known as the Puppet Master is wreaking havoc on the internet, breaking into the so-called cyber-brains of several humans as well as “every terminal on the network.” As it turns out, the Puppet Master is a creation of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In other words, the Puppet Master is what we would call today a government-backed hacker, or advanced persistent threat ( APT ). In this case, however, the “phantom” hacker goes rogue and is wanted for “stock manipulation, spying, political engineering, terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.” That is the basic premise of the Japanese anime cult classic “ Ghost in the Shell ,” which marked its 30th anniversary this week since its debut, and was based on the chapters titled “Bye Bye Clay” and “Ghost Coast” from the first volume of the eponymous manga, released in May 1989. To say that the story of the Puppet Master was ahead of its time may be an understatement. The World Wide Web, essentially what flourished from the internet as we know it today, was invented in 1989, the same year that the first volume of “Ghost in the Shell’s” manga — including the story of the Puppet Master — hit newsstands in Japan. (The World Wide Web publicly launched in 1991.) In the manga, when the Puppet Master gets caught, an official from Public Security Section 6, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explains that they had been after the hacker “for a long time,” and they “profiled his behavioral tendencies and code/tech patterns.” “As a result, we were finally able to create a special anti-puppeteer attack barrier,” the official says in the manga. At the risk of extrapolating too much from a couple of sentences, the reality is that what the official is describing is basically what cybersecurity companies, such as antivirus firms, do everyday to stop malware. Not only do they create so-called signatures based on the malware’s code, but also based on its behavior and prope", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/how-the-classic-anime-ghost-in-the-shell-predicted-the-future-of-cybersecurity-30-years-ago/", "timestamp": 1763619978.4866326}

Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new. “Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same. “Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said. Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.” Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox. “So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox.

Function Health , which offers a regular lab testing service to help people track their health, wants to change that by consolidating health data and making it usable for its customers by connecting that data to an AI model. To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. The funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million. Alongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research.

Suno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix. The company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September.

It previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024 , led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. But Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission. Those types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material.

Across North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. Data centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News. The report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. At the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.) This year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up. Still, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. Most of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work.

The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay more than $152,000 to settle charges. Backed by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences. However, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. When the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data. Additionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower. According to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. “This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/subletting-startup-kiki-paid-over-152k-to-settle-charges-after-violating-nyc-short-term-rental-laws/", "timestamp": 1763619981.7297826}

Specifically, the company said it’s introducing new updates around how it tracks violations of its Community Guidelines and enforces its policies. This includes the inclusion of new reporting categories in the app, changes to its “strike” system for violations, and more guidance provided to those who violate the rules. The moderation changes are rolling out with the latest version of the Bluesky app (v. 1.110), which also includes a dark-mode app icon and a redesigned feature for controlling who can reply to your post. The company says the moderation updates are a result of Bluesky’s rapid growth and the need for “clear standards and expectations for how people treat each other” on the platform. “On Bluesky, people are meeting and falling in love, being discovered as artists, and having debates on niche topics in cozy corners. At the same time, some of us have developed a habit of saying things behind screens that we’d never say in person,” the company shared in an announcement, explaining the changes. However, the news also follows the most recent moderat i on dust-up on the platform, which saw a user suspended for making a comment that Bluesky interpreted as a threat of violence. Author and influencer Sarah Kendzior had written in a post on Bluesky that she wanted to “shoot the author of this article just to watch him die” — a reference to a Johnny Cash song lyric . That choice of words was apt because she was commenting on an article about Johnny Cash that she didn’t like. Bluesky’s team said that Kendzior was suspended because she expressed “a desire to shoot the author of the article”– a very literal reading of her commentary. With the updated rules, Bluesky seems focused on ensuring the platform maintains a sense of community and doesn’t devolve into the toxicity that now fuels X, where snarky comments, dunks, ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/bluesky-announces-moderation-changes-focused-on-better-tracking-improved-transparency/", "timestamp": 1763619982.2588294}

There are already several companies that allow you to connect different services to search through data. Now a startup called Poly is launching a service that encourages you to dump all your files into one place so you can query them to find the right content. At launch, it’s giving 100GB of storage to users on its free tier. This is Poly’s second inning from a product perspective. The company was started by founders Abhay Agarwal and Sam Young in 2022. Young has since left the company. At that time, the startup, which had participated in the startup accelerator Y Combinator, allowed users to create 3D assets using prompts . Agarwal, who is a research fellow at Microsoft and worked on vision AI to help the visually impaired, said the company didn’t predict that the AI image and asset generation industry would blow up and competitors would raise large sums rapidly. That’s when the team decided to pivot. “We interviewed our users and asked them what the pain points of their workflows were that could be solved by AI. Turned out that one big unmet need for users was organizing their file system. As a user, you have a lot of files on your computer, and it is hard to find stuff. We wanted to solve for that,” Agarwal said. He said that the startup shut down the previous iteration of Poly in 2023, went into stealth, and started building the new cloud-based file organizer. The company is now launching the product for the public after testing it in closed beta for a few months. Currently, you can use Poly on the web or Mac, with a Windows version coming soon. The company will start onboarding users from its waitlist starting today.

In a statement, Adobe said it would offer $12 per share for Semrush, almost double the latter’s closing price of $6.89 on Tuesday, before news of the deal. Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday’s close. By acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and web pages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools. Indeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data . Semrush has been investing in what it calls “generative engine optimization,” and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity. “Brand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don’t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,” said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe’s Digital Experience Business. “With Semrush, we’re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.” Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

Once they turn 16, they will be able to access their old account as they left it. It will be a challenge, however, for Meta to determine which users are under the age of 16, since people aren’t always truthful about their age when signing up for social media services. But digital age checks are notoriously difficult to execute in a manner that’s safe and effective. Identity verification services are high-profile targets for hacks, and the implications of even a minor security vulnerability are severe, since personal information and government documents can be exposed.

The company will also release tools that show how songs are connected and what inspired them. The second set of tools is showcased in a new, interactive feature called SongDNA, which shows which songs are being sampled in a given track, who has covered the tune, and what other projects the song’s collaborators may have been involved in. TechCrunch reported in October that Spotify was developing the SongDNA feature as a way to help users discover music through a song’s credits, after references to the feature were spotted in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong. With SongDNA, Spotify users could explore the other projects that the artists, musicians, and others who worked on a track are involved with. Previously, the Song Credits feature had only featured the topline performance, songwriting, and production credits. References to the sampled music, meanwhile, come from the online community-built database WhoSampled, which Spotify has acquired. Notably, the streaming service TIDAL also offers interactive credits that let users explore music through the contributors behind the songs. Spotify has also planned a feature called “About the song,” which will allow listeners to explore swipeable cards in the “Now Playing” view. Those cards will offer details like what inspired the song, the stories behind the music, the cultural impact, and more. These stories are sourced from third-party resources, which will be linked in the cards. This type of background information about music is something Spotify has offered in previous years, when it partnered with lyrics site Genius on a feature that offered details on certain tracks’ backstories .

A draft of the order viewed by WIRED directs US attorney general Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force,” whose purpose is to sue states in court for passing AI regulations that allegedly violate federal laws governing things like free speech and interstate commerce. Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation.

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said. The CEO’s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments.

Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years. A number of US startups are now working on humanoids, including Agility Robotics , Figure AI , 1x , and of course Tesla .

When it debuted at CES early this year, the Brisk It Zelos-450 was advertised as being \"the first grill with generative AI.\" That AI comes in the form of \"Vera,\" an in-app feature that “creates customized recipes based on your input\" and then sets the grill's temperature to cook them. The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice.

That's a significant markdown for this TV, which can typically be found between $1,000 and $1,200. LG Amazon Walmart LG Costco The star of the show is LG's OLED panel, the type typically found on TVs twice the price. If you're curious why that's so important, we have a great explainer that breaks down the difference between all the different panel types . The important takeaway here is that the pixels emit their own light, allowing individual spots of the screen to be perfectly black. The result is impressive, with incredible contrast between the brightest and darkest spots that's best understood by seeing it in person. The other areas of the screen are excellent as well. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata opined that “there's a sumptuous touch to images of all sorts,\" and liked the colors as well, which were accurate and sharp without any adjustment. The screen has a natural and vivid performance to it that feels all the more impressive when you consider the price point. It has the chops for some gaming too, with feature support that meets or beats higher-end screens. With four proper HDMI 2.1 inputs, your consoles won't need to fight for the good ports, which is a nice surprise for the price point. It can reach a refresh rate of up to 120 Hz, which is just fine for most console gamers, and has both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync to make sure everything is smooth, plus Auto Low Latency Mode for quick response times.

Interactions with AI tools are often mundane, but they can also lead to dire outcomes. Users sometimes experience mental breakdowns during lengthy conversations with chatbots or confide in them about their suicidal ideations . “We need to have really big conversations across society about what role we want AI to play in our future as humans who are interacting with each other,” says Ryn Linthicum, head of user well-being policy at Anthropic . At the event‚ organized by Anthropic and Stanford, industry folk intermingled with academics and other experts, splitting into small groups to talk about nascent AI research and brainstorming deployment guidelines for chatbot companions. Anthropic says less than one percent of its Claude chatbot’s interactions are roleplay scenarios initiated by users; it’s not what the tool was designed for. Still, chatbots and the users who love interacting with them as companions are a complicated issue for AI builders, which often take disparate approaches to safety .

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763619988.1216927}

I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again.

Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States.

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108.

This works great for those of us who want cinematic low end, but can't rely on an outlet right where you want to place it. It can even be placed horizontally to fit under higher-bottomed couches and chairs, or a cabinet with legs. Simple HDMI connection makes it super easy to pair with any modern TV, and it even has Bluetooth for pairing with phones, tablets, and other media players.

But it will cost you.", "content": "8 /10 Thrustmaster has been building a reliable fleet of high-end joypads for years now, largely through its range of ESWAP controllers featuring modular components and re-mappable inputs. It's also put out one of the better stick-drift eliminating Hall effect grips for PC and Xbox players in recent memory with 2024's H.E.A.R.T. controller . So what happens when they get thrown into a blender? Out pours the ESWAP X2 H.E., combining all the customization of the ESWAP range but finally delivering the pro-tier precision of Hall effect . It outperforms both its parents—but has also inherited some of the family's worst traits. When I reviewed the H.E.A.R.T. Controller, I termed it \"an entry-level pro controller\". By extension, the ESWAP X2 H.E. is what you might graduate to. Compared to that predecessor, it feels like a massive upgrade—from the overall build quality to the almost daunting versatility of its swappable components, everything about it feels like it's giving you more . However, for those coming from previous generation ESWAP pads , it's unlikely to seem quite so revolutionary—in fact, it's essentially the same, bar the addition of Hall effect tech. Out of the box, the X2 H.E. looks suitably impressive, a monolith of black broken up only by the copper tones of the D-pad and triggers, subtly matched by the lettering on the face buttons and dragon \"2\" of the logo. The LED color bar of the H.E.A.R.T. is gone, making this look and feel far more mature, although the mix of matte black for fixed features and glossy removable modules does make for a degree of visual inconsistency. In the hand, it's definitely better suited to those with larger grips, thanks to a chunky overall size of 160 x 120 x 60 mm and the unusual height of the default thumbstick modules. These sit about 12 mm from their base, compared to the approximately 8 mm of a standard Xbox controller, and you can immediately feel the difference. Thrustmaster ESWAP X2 H.E.

The 32-year-old Michigan engineer, who did not want to use his real name due to privacy concerns, first watched porn at the impressionable age of 12, but never realized he had a problem until just after his father’s funeral three years ago. “I didn't shed a single tear,” he says. “I didn't know how to react happily or sadly to anything.” That’s when his porn consumption spiraled—combined with stress, anxiety, and depression—and he locked himself in his room “all day.” The only thing that seemed palpable, he recalls, “was that rush of dopamine” delivered by an intense session of hardcore porn viewing. But for Jamie, who is Christian, those fleeting moments of porn-fueled transcendance were followed by far deeper lows, including suicidal ideations. This past March, Jamie says his partner angrily confronted him over his compulsive porn consumption, accusing him of lying and committing adultery. Jamie’s “entire world came down.” He admitted he felt that he was addicted, begged for her forgiveness, temporarily moved back in with his mother, and renounced porn. That’s when he found Relay , an app created by a pair of Mormon college students that claims it can help people “take back control from porn, one day at a time.” Jamie promised his partner he would never watch porn again—and she gave him one chance. The app provides a comprehensive plan to stop watching porn, with videos by therapists, daily journal prompts, live group sharing sessions, and a function to address serious urges. Users even keep track of each other’s porn-free streaks, with a “Live Milestone” ticker. This is all in an effort to help customers, who pay $149 per year for full access, unpack their underlying issues like loneliness and trauma to help prevent relapse. The app has been downloaded over 110,000 times, with company data showing that 89 percent of its users are male.

The Great Meme Reset of 2026, as it’s being called on TikTok , demands that on January 1 all memes revert to their 2010s glory days. Bland “ brain rot ” and AI -looking memes are out; Big Chungus is in. As with anything on the internet, the origin of the Great Meme Reset is hard to place. Most sources point to a March post from TikTok user @joebro909 that called for a whole new generation of memes to save the platform from the “ drought ” that had engulfed it in the spring. The post said nothing of a January 1 launch date, or a return to the memes of the last decade, but the idea was planted. Now hundreds of posts are discussing the reboot—and a return to the internet’s “dank” era. Which implies, of course, that memes lack dankness these days. If anything, Gen Z– and Gen Alpha–fueled internet culture has prided itself on somewhat meaningless content like “ 6 7 ” and absurdist, seemingly AI-generated “ Italian brain rots ,” but after nearly a year of memes with little humanity or depth, a backlash has begun. “Because of just how unrecognizable memes have become,” TikTok creator Noah Glenn Carter ( @noahglenncarter ) said in a recent video, “everyone has come to an agreement that on January 1, 2026, we are going to completely reset all memes and go back to the originals.” When I reach Carter via email, the creator seems pretty convinced the reset idea could take off, and he plans to make more videos promoting it. “The memes we have now are called ‘brain rot’ for a reason,” Carter says. “The ones 10+ [years older], most of the time, had a story behind them. Or they at least made sense. Now it just seems like the more random and incoherent something is the more likely it is to become a meme.” Even if you’re in the camp that understands memes like “6 7” have more significance than they’re given credit for, there’s still a sense amongst the Great Rese", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-great-meme-reset-is-coming/", "timestamp": 1763619989.9913683}

It also removed one: Launchpad. The feature, which gave Mac users an iPhone-like grid of applications complete with support for folders, is missing from macOS 26. Now, to be fair, a lot of people didn't really use Launchpad. Many people keep their most-used applications on their dock and turn to Spotlight, or other launchers like macOS's new Apps window, to quickly access the rest. But Launchpad had a few die-hard users, many of whom are mourning the loss of the feature on social media. What are they supposed to do? The good news: There are a few decent replacements. I tried out several, and here's the one I think is best (followed by a few other suggestions). Launchie is free, available in the Mac App Store, and as of this writing doesn't have any kind of in-app purchases. It's the best Launchpad replacement I could find. Open the application and you'll see all of your apps listed in alphabetical order. You can use your arrow keys to choose an application, if you want, or you can scroll with your mouse. Launchie is a free download. It's not a perfect Launchpad replacement in one way: It's an ongoing scrolling list of applications, not a set of individual panels. But there is a crucial Launchpad feature it offers: folders. Organization gets a lot more useful when you slot things into folders. I, for example, made a folder for all of my games. You can create folders within your launch grid. There are a few settings you can tweak, such as whether the launcher should take over the full screen or open in a window. You can also configure the appearance, decide whether the app should open when your Mac does, and set a keyboard shortcut for opening the launcher. Customize the look. As I said, it’s not a perfect replacement, but take some time setting up folders and tweaking the settings and I think you'll find it works well. And you can't complain about the price.

The freshman from Phoenix had long struggled with depression and would cut her arms to feel something. Anything. The first drag from a friend’s vape several years ago offered the shy teenager a new way to escape. This article was copublished with The 74 , a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here . She quit cutting but got hooked on nicotine. Her sadness got harder to carry after her uncle died, and she felt she couldn’t turn to her grieving parents for comfort. Bumming fruity vapes at school became part of her routine. “I would ask my friends who had them, ‘I’m going through a lot, can I use it?’” Gutierrez, now 18, told The 74. “Or ‘I failed my test and I feel like smoking would be better than cutting my wrists.’” It worked until she got caught. Like students across the country, Gutierrez got dragged into a nicotine-fueled war between vape manufacturers—including a company that leveraged online advertisements on the websites of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to hook kids on e-cigarettes —and educators, who’ve turned to digital surveillance tools and discipline to crack down on the youngest users. Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour. An in-depth investigation by The 74 reveals how nicotine-addicted teens, who often begin vaping under social pressure or, like Gutierrez, to cope with hardship, are routinely kicked out of school instead of receiving meaningful services that could steer them away from tobacco and help them break free of their vape pens. Candid interviews with a dozen high schoolers and recent graduates from across the country reveal how vaping has become ubiquitous in schools.

The screen is slightly lower resolution, and the pass-through isn't quite as sharp, but otherwise the Quest 3S plays the same games and experiences as the more expensive Quest 3 . Both headsets suffer from limited battery life, so don't expect more than a couple of hours of play at a time.

Heavy sleepers know how easy it is to snooze through the overly genteel alarms on your phone. For people who can’t get out of bed without a bigger jolt, extreme alarms have popped up in recent years—from relatively simple puzzle-alarm phone apps to alarms on wheels to alarms that shake the bed. Not only are these an innovative way to get chronic snoozers out of bed, but they can be great for those who are hard of hearing, utilizing different frequencies and pitches as well as movement through vibration. I’m a very heavy sleeper, so I tried one of these nontraditional extreme alarm clocks every day for a full week (at least). I chose the extreme alarms that were the most rated or reviewed online, found most often on online retailers like Amazon and in the app store, and tried to get a versatile range of options that focused on different areas, whether it be sound or activity. While I can say that they worked better at getting me out and helping me stay out of bed, most mornings I woke up with anxiety like I was being hunted for sport.

It is connected to an app on your phone, where you set up to three alarms (repeated daily or on specific schedules) with snooze increments of one, two, three, six, or nine minutes. Then, you place the device somewhere that requires you to get out of bed, and when the alarm goes off, you have to tap on it with your phone to silence it. The Lasso can only be snoozed once, so make sure to put it where you can reach it in time and still get some shut-eye; otherwise, you may as well wake up.

As talk of an AI bubble grows, the company is keen to stress that its latest release is more than just a clever model and chatbot—it’s a way of improving Google’s existing products, including its lucrative search business, starting today. “We are the engine room of Google, and we're plugging in AI everywhere now,” Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind, an AI-focused subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told WIRED in an interview ahead of the announcement. Hassabis admits that the AI market appears inflated, with a number of unproven startups receiving multibillion-dollar valuations. Google and other AI firms are also investing billions in building out new data centers to train and run AI models, sparking fears of a potential crash. But even if the AI bubble bursts, Hassabis thinks Google is insulated. The company is already using AI to enhance products like Google Maps, Gmail, and Search. “In the downside scenario, we will lean more on that,” Hassabis says. “In the upside scenario, I think we've got the broadest portfolio and the most pioneering research.” Google is also using AI to build popular new tools like NotebookLM , which can auto-generate podcasts from written materials, and AI Studio which can prototype applications with AI. It’s even exploring embedding the technology into areas like gaming and robotics, which Hassabis says could pay huge dividends in years to come, regardless of what happens in the wider market. Google is making Gemini 3 available today through the Gemini app and in AI Overviews , a Google Search feature that synthesizes information alongside regular search results. In demos, the company showed that some Google queries, like a request for information about the three-body problem in physics , will prompt Gemini 3 to automatically generate a custom interactive visualization on the fly", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/google-launches-gemini-3-ai-bubble-search/", "timestamp": 1763619991.565661}

Agent 365 is not a platform for making enterprise AI tools; it’s a way to manage them, as if they were human employees . Companies using generative AI agents in their digital workplace can use Agent 365 to organize their growing sprawl of bots, keep tabs on how they’re performing, and tweak their settings. The tool is rolling out today in Microsoft’s early access program. Essentially, Microsoft created a trackable workspace for agents . “Tools that you use to manage people, devices, and applications today, you'd want to extend them to run agents as well in the future,” says Charles Lamanna, a president of business and industry for Microsoft’s Copilot , its AI chatbot. Lamanna envisions a future where companies have many more agents performing labor than humans. For example, if a company has 100,000 employees, he sees them as using “half a million to a million agents,” ranging in tasks from simple email organization to running the “whole procurement process” for a business. He claims Microsoft internally uses millions of agents. This army of bots, with permission to take actions inside a company’s software and automate aspects of an employee’s workflow, could quickly grow unwieldy to track. A lack of clear oversight could also open businesses up to security breaches . Agent 365 is a way to manage all your bots, whether those agents were built with Microsoft’s tools or through a third-party platform. Agent 365’s core feature is a registry of an organization’s active agents all in one place, featuring specific identification numbers for each and details about how they are being used by employees. It’s also where you can change the settings for agents and what aspects of a business’s software each one has permission to access.

Binoculars are usually listed with two number specifications; for example, our top pick, the Nikon Monarch M5 are 8x42 binoculars. Here's what that means: The number 8 refers to the magnification power . Objects seen through these binoculars will be eight times bigger than when you look with your naked eye. Newcomers should stick with 6X or 8X. They have enough power that you'll see things clearly, but they don't magnify so much that you'll struggle to find what you want to see or have trouble following fast-moving objects (though all binoculars take some practice). The 42 refers to the size of the front lens in millimeters . The larger the front lens (also called the objective lens), the more light reaches your eye. That means the image will be bigger, brighter, and clearer. A pair of 8x42 binoculars should be significantly brighter and offer a better viewing experience than a pair of 8x32 binoculars, even though both provide the same magnification. But the larger you get, the more glass they will use—so they'll weigh more. The weight difference between an 8x32 pair and a 10x42 pair is significant if you're wearing them all day.

The result is a sprawling exposure of personal information for a significant fraction of the world population. One group of Austrian researchers have now shown that they were able to use that simple method of checking every possible number in WhatsApp's contact discovery to extract 3.5 billion users’ phone numbers from the messaging service. For about 57 percent of those users, they also found that they could access their profile photos, and for another 29 percent, the text on their profiles. Despite a previous warning about WhatsApp's exposure of this data from a different researcher in 2017, they say, the service's parent company, Meta, still failed to limit the speed or number of contact discovery requests the researchers could make by interacting with WhatsApp's browser-based app, allowing them to check roughly a hundred million numbers an hour. The result would be “the largest data leak in history, had it not been collated as part of a responsibly conducted research study,” as the researchers describe it in a paper documenting their findings . “To the best of our knowledge, this marks the most extensive exposure of phone numbers and related user data ever documented,” says Aljosha Judmayer, one of the researchers at the University of Vienna who worked on the study.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate. We also raise our EBITDA margin by 150-10bps on the margin beat.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive. We remain positive on Hatsun due to competitive advantages such as established brands, distribution and direct milk procurement. We marginally raise FY25E and FY26E earnings by 0.4% and 3.3%, respectively.

The move comes after the US Congress passed an Act to make all Epstein files public on Tuesday. As a result, the files related to all the cases involving the deceased sex offender will be released by the Department of Justice . The release of the files has been sought eagerly by both Trump’s political opponents as well as some members of the Republican Party, who have pressed for greater transparency in the matter. The documents may shed more light on Epstein’s activities. The late financier used to socialise with Trump and other notable figures before a 2008 conviction on charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution, Reuters reported. According to the BBC, the already-released files connected to Epstein include the names of prominent individuals such as Andrew, the Duke of Mountbatten Windsor, brother of King Charles, former US President Bill Clinton , and the late pop icon Michael Jackson. On 12 November, emails connected to the estate of Epstein were released. They featured the names of Larry Summers, the Treasury Secretary under President Clinton, and Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former aide. Other names that have emerged from the Epstein files include Michael Wolff, a senior journalist and author of several notable books; Kathryn Ruemmler, White House counsel under President Barack Obama; billionaire investor Peter Thiel; linguist and activist Noam Chomsky; publicist Peggy Siegel, and others. None of these individuals has been accused of any wrongdoing. All of them have said that their contacts with Epstein were non-controversial in nature.

In a post on Reddit , the techie shared an unfiltered account of his academic struggles, low confidence and the slow, often difficult path that eventually led to a breakthrough opportunity. The user wrote that he had scored 17 out of 360 in JEE Mains and secured 73% in Class 12, a phase he described as a sharp decline from being academically strong in school. “Tier-3 college, low confidence, no real personality,” he wrote, adding that college at least gave him “really good friends”. The pandemic, however, made things harder. He said Covid led to a long period of isolation — one that forced him to rebuild himself quietly and steadily. Despite limited expectations, he was placed at a service-based company with a salary of ₹ 7.4 lakh per annum. Over time, he switched to a startup where he earned ₹ 13.5 lakh a year. The turning point, he said, came unexpectedly. “One day, an Amazon recruiter reached out and I made it. ₹ 60 lakh a year.” But he emphasised that the salary jump is only part of the story. He described the personal changes that accompanied his career growth — developing confidence, improving his fitness and building a sense of identity he previously lacked. “Now I am someone with an athletic body, good humour, and a presence I never had before… I have not finally found myself, but I have found some of me. And that feels good.” Reddit users responded with encouragement and appreciation, calling the post relatable and motivating. Several highlighted the honesty in sharing both failures and self-doubt — aspects rarely visible behind high-paying tech jobs. A user asked, “Congratulations OP.

His controversial comments raise questions about Pakistan's role in regional terrorism and ongoing tensions with India.", "content": "A Pakistani politician has purportedly hinted at Islamabad’s involvement in the 10 November Red Fort blast. In a video, now viral on social media, Anwarul Haq, the former “Prime Minister” of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, is heard saying that terror groups linked to Pakistan carried out attacks “from the Red Fort to the forests of Kashmir”. Haq, who lost the no-confidence motion in the regional assembly, however, did not clearly mention whether he was referring to the November 10 car bomb attack in Delhi near Lal Quila , which left about 10 dead, including Dr Umar Nabi, a Kashmiri who was driving the car. “I earlier said that if you keep bleeding Balochistan, we'll hit India from Red Fort to the forests of Kashmir. By the grace of Allah, we've done it and they're still unable to count bodies,” Anwarul Haq is heard saying during a speech in the PoK Assembly. Clearly, Haq was referring to the Pahalgam attack in the Baisaran meadows of South Kashmir, where the attackers were from Pakistan. The attacker in the Delhi Red Fort was not from Pakistan, and the government has not officially established or suspected a role of Pakistan in the attack. Investigators, however, said that the Red Fort attack was a part of a larger “white-collar terror module” linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terror group based in Pakistan and founded by Masood Azhar, a UN-designated terrorist. Haq's statement comes amid Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif 's warning that Islamabad cannot ignore the possibility of an \"all-out war\" with India and that the country needs to be on \"full alert\". He said India cannot be trusted, adding that the country has been put on maximum alert for \"any border incursion\". “We cannot ignore (India) in any way...

Her revelation, coming days after she called a 3 a.m. staff meeting to prepare for a parliamentary session, has triggered fresh concerns about the country’s long-standing struggle with overwork. Appearing before a legislative committee, Takaichi said: “I sleep about two hours now, four hours at the longest. I feel it’s bad for my skin.” Her comments immediately set off criticism from opposition lawmakers and workers’ unions, who argued that Japan’s leader should be setting an example in promoting healthier work-life boundaries — not reinforcing extreme work habits. Japan’s overwork crisis is well documented. The country even has a dedicated term for deaths caused by excessive work: karōshi. The government is now reportedly considering raising the cap on overtime hours to boost economic growth, further fuelling concern among labour groups. According to the labour ministry, nearly 1 in 5 white-collar workers is at risk of overwork-related illnesses, including strokes, cardiac issues and severe mental stress. Alongside long hours, international workers in Japan often struggle with another aspect of the country’s workplace culture: hyper-polite, indirect communication. A viral Reddit post described it as “feedback so subtle it feels like a puzzle,” with employees rarely told directly whether their performance is good or poor. “No one ever says ‘good job’ or ‘you made a mistake’. It’s always: ‘Maybe next time, try a different way.’ It’s exhausting trying to read between the lines,” the user wrote. This style — rooted in tatemae, or maintaining social harmony — can leave newcomers feeling confused and anxious about their standing at work.

The post, shared by a woman named Komal Porwal, a copywriter, details how the man juggles multiple jobs to earn around ₹ 1 lakh per month. Porwal wrote that she was on a Rapido ride on Sunday night at around 9 pm when she initiated a conversation with her driver — a chat that ultimately dispelled the misconception that “people don’t want to work hard anymore.” Describing the driver as “cheerful and an extroverted personality”, she said they were having a casual conversation about life when she asked him about his full-time occupation: “Bhaiya, aap full-time ye karte ho?” The man smiled and explained that he works as a Swiggy delivery partner in the morning, drives for Rapido in the evening, and on weekends runs a local street food stall (pani puri vendor) with his brother. “I was stunned,” Porwal wrote. He told her, “Bas ma’am, thoda mehnat zyada hai, par ghar khushi se chal raha hai.” (“Ma’am, it’s just a little more hard work, but my household is running happily.”) Porwal said she was taken aback by his workload. When asked about his earnings, the rider told her he makes around ₹ 1 lakh per month, combining all three income streams. Despite the demanding schedule, he reiterated, “Bas ma’am, thoda mehnat zyada hai, par ghar khushi se chal raha hai.” (“It’s a bit more hard work, ma’am, but my household runs happily.”) Porwal’s post challenges the notion that people today “don’t want to work hard”, suggesting instead that examples of dedication often go unnoticed in everyday life — sometimes even in the form of a Rapido driver at the end of a long day.

India launched ‘ Operation Sindoor ’—precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir—on May 7, in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack of 22 April 2025, in which 26 civilians, mostly tourists, were killed after terrorists opened fire at visitors in Baisaran meadow , a popular tourist spot near Pahalgam in Jammu & Kashmir’s Anantnag district. The USCC claim contradicts India’s stand on the conflict. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said India had showcased its capabilities during “Operation Sindoor” and brought Pakistan to its knees within a few hours. “While characterisation of this conflict as a ‘proxy war’ may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the contexts of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defence industry goals,” the report reads. The USCC’s reference to the India-Pakistan conflict in its report comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has been consistently disregarding New Delhi’s rebuttals while reiterating his claims about brokering a ceasefire deal that ended the four-day conflict between the two South Asian neighbours.

This year has been no different, with AQI readings once again forcing schools to shut and families to make difficult choices. Amid this, a thought-provoking LinkedIn post by Delhi-based Akshay Verma, Co-founder of FITPASS, has struck a chord with thousands of parents. In his post, Verma writes about how even his 3-year-old son now has to learn an unexpected new concept: AQI. “One week he’s learning how to hold a pencil… next week he’s learning why he can’t go to school because the air is ‘too poisonous’,” he writes, highlighting the surreal reality of parenting in the capital — where school closures have become as unpredictable as the smog itself. Verma points out how Delhi’s stop-start academic routine is increasingly dominated by sudden shutdowns. “Summer break, Diwali break — and now an annual ‘pollution break’ nobody wants to call by its real name,” he says. For a child who still thinks “clouds live inside cartoons,” he adds, trying to explain toxic air is both heartbreaking and absurd. Against this backdrop, Verma proposes a simple but radical rethink: Instead of the long summer break, he suggests a long winter break — from Diwali to January — when Delhi’s air quality consistently dips to its worst levels. Since heat can be managed but toxic air cannot, Verma argues that schools could operate smoothly through the summer and pause during the months when pollution routinely shuts the city down anyway. Doctors, he notes, are already advising families who can afford it to relocate to cleaner cities for 6 to 8 weeks during peak pollution. But for most households — including millions of working-class families — that isn’t an option. “They are forced to breathe whatever the city decides,” Verma writes.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani had said on Monday that he hopes to meet with President Donald Trump to find ways the political polar opposites can work together on the central focus of his winning campaign: affordability. The Democrat had earlier confirmed that his team had reached out to the White House to set up a possible meeting with Trump. Trump told reporters Sunday night that he planned to meet with Mamdani, saying, “we’ll work something out” as he prepared to fly back to Washington after spending the weekend in Florida.

Delhi has not fulfilled its payment security mechanism requirement under the scheme, which asks states and Union territories to create a direct debit mandate (DDM) with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Without fulfilling this condition, the city's will not be eligible for the country’s largest e-bus tender for 10,900 buses under the ₹ 10,900-crore PM E-Drive scheme. Under the PM E-Drive scheme, the direct debit mandate allows the RBI to automatically deduct money from a state or Union territory's account and ensure timely payments to the bus suppliers. Now, the ministry of heavy industries, the RBI, the Union home ministry, and the government of Delhi are rushing to clear this hurdle by exploring the possibility of using Delhi’s own consolidated fund, created under the 1993 Delhi Act, two officials aware of the development said. “Delhi has now begun meetings with the home ministry and the RBI to resolve this issue,\" said the first of the two officials cited above, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. Under Indian law, the Union home ministry is responsible for handling finances of Union territories that don't have their own legislatures. But Delhi is a Union territory with a legislature, and wants to use its own consolidated fund for meeting the key conditions for the bus tender, the second official said.

All of them often turned to the same man for advice and connections: Jeffrey Epstein, CNN reported. Many also sought his company to trade gossip about then-President Donald Trump. New emails expose that many of Epstein's pen-pals looked to him for guidance on avoiding their own sexual scandals. Shockingly, this was even after his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution with a minor. His status as a registered sex offender did not deter these high-profile contacts. The House Oversight Committee released more than 23,000 pages of records obtained from Epstein's estate last week. The release was extraordinary. Epstein had died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Those messages were scrutinised for new revelations about Epstein’s relationship with Trump. The records show Epstein relished talking about their one-time friendship as Trump rose to power. He offered opinions on everything from the president’s sanity—calling him “f***ing crazy” – to who should be in his Cabinet, CNN reported. However, the thousands of Epstein emails also revealed another key aspect of his uniquely corrupting role in American society. They showed how he cast himself at the centre of a vast web of power and influence. CNN analysed about 2,200 email threads. It found at least 740 exchanges between Epstein and prominent figures in academia, government, media and business. Epstein’s correspondence with them spanned a decade, from 2009 to the day before his July 2019 arrest. The correspondence also included numerous text messages. These messages also showed him communicating with other figures who aren't named in unredacted emails, including Democratic Rep. Stacey Plaskett during a 2019 Congressional hearing.

She was reportedly charged with larceny after police said she stole $11,000 worth of furniture from a furnished rental condo. Mia Thornton was taken into custody and booked at the Fulton County Jail. The arrest occurred after officers responded to a call from the Customs and Border Protection office at the airport. A police report obtained by CBS News Atlanta stated that Fields-Thornton was accused of stealing the furniture from a condo she was renting on Marietta Street. In the report, the condo's management company alleged Fields-Thornton and a man, identified as Jared McGriff, \"suddenly moved out of the unit in the middle of the night\" on October 28, taking the furniture and television. The total cost of the allegedly-stolen furniture is estimated to be around $11,000, police reportedly said. The property manager was quoted by local media as saying that Fields-Thornton left the property without notifying anyone, taking furniture and a TV that belonged to the owner. The furniture was not supposed to be taken by the tenants, as it belonged to her client, according to the property manager. In body camera footage, Fields-Thornton confirmed with police that she knew that she had a warrant out for her arrest. Fields-Thornton, who started on the popular Bravo show during its sixth season, announced that she had moved to Atlanta and would not be returning to the show in April. Mia Thornton announced her departure from the “Real Housewives of Potomac” series in April after four seasons. According to People magazine, she announced her exit from 'The Real Housewives of Potomax', stating she is stepping back to focus on her family and a new phase in her life.

His defense claims the case is vindictive, influenced by Trump.", "content": "The prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey encountered a new hurdle on Wednesday (November 19) as the Justice Department acknowledged a potential procedural error in how the case was presented to a federal grand jury. The issue arose during a hearing where Comey’s attorneys asked US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff to dismiss the case, claiming the government’s actions were vindictive and improperly influenced by President Donald Trump. Comey’s lawyer, Michael Dreeben, argued that the failure to present the final two-count indictment to the full grand jury could be grounds for dismissal. “That would be tantamount to a bar of further prosecution in this case,” Dreeben told the court. US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick had earlier reviewed a transcript of the grand jury proceedings and questioned whether all jurors saw the final indictment. Justice Department prosecutor Tyler Lemons confirmed that only two jurors, including the foreperson, were present when the revised indictment was submitted. James Comey, dismissed by President Donald Trump in 2017 and a longtime critic since, is seeking to have federal charges dismissed that stem from his 2020 testimony. He is among several individuals seen as Trump’s opponents who have faced recent investigations or indictments. Comey faces charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, linked to sworn testimony about whether he authorized an FBI colleague to serve as an anonymous source to the news media. Comey has pleaded not guilty. Dreeben contended that the indictment was influenced by political pressure from Trump. “The president’s use of the Department of Justice to bring a criminal prosecution against a vocal and prominent critic in order to punish and deter those who would speak out against him violates the Constitution,” he said. Trump had publicly demanded action against Comey, posting in September: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation.

The defense lawyer for 49-year-old Serhii Kuznietsov said that his client would be turned over to German authorities within the next few days, after the Cassation Court rejected a final defense appeal. Defense lawyer Nicola Canestrini expressed confidence that his client would be acquitted at trial. The explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which carried Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea until Russia cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. They also damaged the parallel Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered into service, because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia went to war with Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Kuznietsov was detained on a European arrest warrant on Aug. 21 at a campground near the Adriatic coastal city of Rimini, where he was vacationing with his family. German prosecutors say that Kuznietsov organized and carried out the detonation of at least four bombs between 14 and 27 kilograms (around 31 to 62 pounds) at a depth of 70 to 80 meters (230 feet to 263 feet) in the Baltic Sea near the Danish island of Bornholm on Sept. 26, 2022, according to extradition documents.

The Labour Bureau's ‘employment situation’ report usually comes out on the first Friday of the month. This month, the report got delayed due to the government shutdown , which affected data collection. The September jobs report was originally due on October 3. It will now be out on Thursday. The job report, which measures job creation, wages and other measurements of the labor market , is composed of two surveys: — A survey of households that is used to determine the unemployment rate, among other things. — The ‘establishment' survey of companies, nonprofits and government agencies that is used. Last week, the advocacy group Friends of BLS, which is led in part by two of the agency’s former commissioners, told Bloomberg that because of the long shutdown, October 2025 will permanently remain a partial blind spot in America’s official record. “In some cases, BLS will be unable to retroactively collect consistent information about Americans’ experiences during this period.” Wednesday's announcement means the September jobs numbers will likely get extra scrutiny Thursday.

The latest data represents the narrowest gap as compared to $58.3 billion in October 2023. It marks a 24 per cent fall from the $78.2 billion deficit seen in July.  The notable contraction was primarily driven by a 5.1 per cent decline in imports, the largest dip in four months, while exports rose marginally 0.1 per cent, the BEA reported. The data arrives in the context of the far-reaching tariffs announced by President Donald Trump in April on ‘Liberation Day’ and subsequently expanded in August. These actions raised the effective tariff rate imposed by the US to 18 per cent. The tariffs implementation was twice paused until 1 August. Trump signed an executive order setting revised rates for 68 countries and the European Union, with some of his original levies adjusted following agreements with nine countries.  The Atlanta Federal Reserve currently anticipates that the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will increase by 4.2 per cent in the third quarter, with exports predicted to contribute up to 0.78 percentage points of that growth. This follows a 3 per cent rise in GDP during the second quarter, which exceeded a Dow Jones consensus of 2.3 per cent, a period where both exports and imports fell, as reported by Forbes.

And we are giving it names too!” he added. “Don’t get me wrong - I love music. But if concerts are now a reason to take a mid-week leave, I have clearly fostered the wrong work culture,” Sharma wrote. Other LinkedIn users reacted humorously to the post. “Even though I don’t belong to this generation (and I still come up with 100 believable excuses for a mid-week break), I’m honestly a bit jealous of them. They know how to draw boundaries and maintain balance,” came from one of them. “I believe you have fostered the right work culture, When your team member has been able to openly tell you the truth of his actual reaso", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/employee-wants-leave-for-travis-scott-mumbai-concert-calls-it-work-life-balance-social-media-quips-valid-reason-11763569282042.html", "timestamp": 1763620043.436171}

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart. Simply put, how international experience can benefit your career is by opening doors that domestic education often can’t.

Whether you’re heading to Europe, Asia, or anywhere in between, living and learning in a new culture offers you the chance to build skills that last a lifetime. So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success.
