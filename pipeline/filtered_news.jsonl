The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service. But the surge in applicants and stiff competition also reflects broader socioeconomic pressures. Many in China, according to a Guardian report , appear to be turning away from unstable private-sector jobs in favour of government roles that still promise the much-coveted “iron-rice-bowl” of lifetime job security, even if pay is lower and growth slower. For context, the 2026 recruitment drive aims to fill about 38,100 civil-service posts across central government institutions and their subordinate agencies.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh.

Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test.

The real value lies in taking each mock seriously, approaching it with exam-like discipline, analysing the results with patience and depth, and learning something meaningful from every attempt.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Indian students weigh options amid growing uncertainty", "summary": "", "content": "–Ankit Mehra For decades, the United States has been considered the world’s most desirable higher education destination, especially in STEM fields. It powered the ambitions of Indian students chasing world-class education, research excellence and global careers. Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause. Also Read | US universities saw 17% drop in enrolments from international students in 2025-26 Adding to the uncertainty is speculation about the future of Optional Practical Training (OPT) , the 36-month work authorisation that has long been central to the ROI of a US STEM degree.

INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean.

He’ll stick around through spring as an advisor. His replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It’s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately. The move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed. Its first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC complained twice after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn’t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final even began . Then there was Siri’s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple. A Bloomberg investigation published in May revealed the depths of Apple’s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn’t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who’d been promised an AI-powered assistant.

The promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service. In a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.” Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard . More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail , Calendar and Drive. But as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history , and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.

The semiconductor giant announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research at the NeurIPS AI conference in San Diego, California. The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive. This new model is based on Nvidia’s Cosmos-Reason model , a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August. Technology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post . Nvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do. This new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face. Alongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation.

When he first announced the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd …” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.” Panels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog. Thanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked No. 1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum. According to the app intelligence firm Appfigures, Panels reached about 900,000 lifetime downloads and $95,000 in consumer spending across iOS ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/mkbhds-wallpaper-app-panels-is-shutting-down/", "timestamp": 1764641319.9544647}

Meanwhile, a grid monitor is blaming such growth for high electricity prices.", "content": "Planned data center construction shows no signs of fading, with new additions to require 2.7x — nearly triple — the sector’s current demand for electricity over the next decade, according to a new report from BloombergNEF. By 2035, data centers will draw 106 gigawatts, up sharply from the 40 gigawatts they use today. Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, BloombergNEF said . Driving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatt. At the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute. In some ways, the findings in the new report aren’t surprising. AI companies have been racing to build more powerful data centers, helping to drive global investment in the facilities up to $580 billion this year . That’s more than the world spends finding new supplies of oil. Still, the new report shows just how quickly the landscape is changing. It is a sharp revision upwards from a document the group published in April. The upswing was driven by a surge in new projects that have been announced since then. “With an average seven-year timeline for projects to come online, developments in earlier stages affect the tail end of our forecast the most,” the new report said. Early-stage projects have more than doubled between early 2024 and early 2025, though those are distinct from projects that have been committed or are currently under construction.

Europol confirmed the seizure in a press release , where it called Cryptomixer “the platform of choice for cybercriminals seeking to launder illegal proceeds from a variety of criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.” Since 2016, Europol said, Cryptomixer facilitated the laundering of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in Bitcoin. Hackers and other criminals use laundering services such as Cryptomixer to obfuscate and hide the provenance of their cryptocurrency. By design, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on public blockchains that allow law enforcement, as well as blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, to follow the money over time. Authorities said they seized $25 million euros ($29 million) in Bitcoin, along with three servers, 12 terabytes of data, and the official domain cryptomixer.io , which now displays the customary law enforcement seizure splash page. According to Europol, the site “facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums and dark web markets,” and claimed its software “blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain.” “Deposited funds from various users were pooled for a long and randomised period before being redistributed to destination addresses, again at random times. As many digital currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions, mixing services make it difficult to trace specific coins, thus concealing the origin of cryptocurrency,” Europol said. Cryptomixer offered customers anonymity, such as providing cover for cybercriminals who wanted to launder their crypto before taking the funds to legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges. Europol said the “cleaned” cryptocurrency could be swapped for other cryptocurrencies or fiat cash.

Originally designed to add holiday lights to your Mac’s desktop, this popular indie app has been updated this year with several new features, most notably a version of the app that brings its sparkling, colorful lights to iOS devices for the first time. With the new Festivitas app for iPhone and iPad, you can add and customize a string of holiday lights on your device’s Home Screen using iOS widgets. The lights can frame your favorite personal photo (or perhaps a holiday image you dig up on Pinterest), and you can opt to make the widget transparent so it blends in with your background. While seasonal apps can sometimes be low-quality cash grabs, developer Simon Støvring puts genuine effort and thoughtfulness into Festivitas’ design — and doesn’t charge an arm and a leg, either. Instead, the app is available for free to consumers, with premium features that can be unlocked for a fair price of between $3.99 and $9.99. (You get to choose the price that works best for you.) On both macOS and iOS, you can customize the holiday lights in multiple ways, beyond picking their colors and flashing pattern. You can adjust the cable’s thickness, its drop width and height, and choose from pre-made color palettes like Candy Cane, Winter Snow, Elf, and others, or you can design your own. You can also make finer adjustments to things like the colors’ hue or temperature, the speed of the flashes, and the spacing between the lights. Another perk is that you’ll be able to use the lights again outside of the winter holidays, as you can now change the bulb shape to designs like a bat, clover, Easter egg, heart, ghost, star, “2026,” and more throughout the year. This lets you continue to enjoy the app for other holidays and special events — there’s even a “WWDC” bulb for celebrating Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June.

Thrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services. Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but it will involve OpenAI sending employees from its engineering, research, and product teams to work within Thrive’s companies to accelerate AI adoption and boost efficiency. If those companies succeed, OpenAI’s stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to a source familiar with the matter. The partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave . For instance, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy Nvidia chips. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. The Thrive deal has a different structure, but the result is still interdependence. Here is how it will work. OpenAI embeds its own workers to build products and implement systems in Thrive’s portfolio companies. OpenAI profits when those companies scale based on growth its work helped generate. Thrive Holdings pushed back on the circular characterization. A spokesperson emphasized the deal is “responding to an unmet need in the market” rather than creating demand and pointed to organic customer interest from portfolio companies like accounting firm Crete, which has reportedly saved hundreds of hours of work with AI tools, and IT firm Shield that predated the formal partnership.

By releasing early, Deezer beats other streaming music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, in providing an annual summary of listeners’ favorite songs, artists, albums, and genres for 2025. The feature, called “My Deezer Year,” offers users a detailed overview of their top tracks, top artists, favorite albums, and the amount of time spent listening to their most-played artist and their best track. This year’s edition introduces a new “romantic comedy” theme for the recap’s visual presentation. According to Deezer, as users explore their listening habits, they’ll feel as if they’re starring in a romantic comedy, complete with scenes like a “meet cute.” Deezer narrates the story as users navigate through it, teasing plot twists along the way. The experience is divided into three episodes. The first episode, titled “Meet Cute,” highlights the new artists users discovered throughout the year. The second episode, “Love Triangle,” features users’ top three artists, while the final episode, “Happily Ever After,” showcases their favorite tracks, along with a personalized playlist for continued listening. This year’s experience differs from last year’s “My Deezer Year 2024,” which offered a different interactive approach, inviting users to choose between being “roasted” or “hyped up” based on their music preferences. Similar to previous years, this year’s recap also includes a personalized quiz where users can answer compatibility questions based on their musical tastes and share results with friends to find their musical matches. Additionally, users can create their own quizzes to share with others by entering their favorite genre, three songs, and a top artist, then see which friends match their preferences.

The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble. Nvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia’s AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys’ electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release . The deal gave Synopsys’ stock a lift by signaling long-term growth — a boon after the company recently reported weakness in its IP segment due to U.S. export restrictions and issues at a major customer. For Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys’ widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions.

The deal happened because Clipbook’s founder, Adam Joseph, took a long shot with a cold email that he never thought anyone would read, he told TechCrunch. Joseph launched Clipbook in 2023 and bootstrapped it to a million dollars in annual recurring revenue, he said. At that point, about a year ago, he felt he was ready to find investors. “I literally made a list of the top five media investors in the world,” Joseph recalled. His product uses AI to help companies track what the world says about them and their competitors in the press, across podcasts, and in social media. So he wanted investors who understood that scene. Mark Cuban, who has founded media networks, starred on “Shark Tank,” written books, produced movies, and is regularly interviewed on TV, was at the top of Joseph’s list. So, one evening in late 2024, Joseph drank a beer for courage and sent a one-page investment pitch via cold email to everyone on the list. No warm intro. Cuban, alone, answered. It turns out, busy and inundated with pitches as he is, Cuban still scans his own emails. He’s always looking for his next deal. “I have literally invested tens of millions of dollars from emails, and a lot of them have paid off, turned into unicorns,” Cuban tells TechCrunch about why he answered Clipbook. But before Cuban cracked open his checkbook, he put Joseph through a series of tests. His first email response “was the most skeptical 20 questions that he could ever ask,” Joseph recalled. Cuban admits he’s fairly famous for that from “Shark Tank.” “When I start to pepper them, they wilt, right? They wilt or they get angry at a certain level,” Cuban explained. “It’s their baby.

The company isn't \"in the space industry; we're in-space industry,\" he said. Space is \"just another place to ship to.\"", "content": "When Will Bruey talks about the future, the timelines are shorter than most might imagine. The Varda Space Industries CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class employee to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth. The reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX. “I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event . The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.” Varda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit — crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication — joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since.

Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change.

These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Before the day is done, be sure to look at the best Cyber Monday electric toothbrush deals on products we've personally tested. We've also found the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals and deals under $100 , if you need to scoop a last-minute holiday gift. Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them. This electric toothbrush features a narrow head to reach hard-to-reach areas, while two sonic vibration settings efficiently remove plaque. A pressure sensor gauges the pressure you're applying.

But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more.

The findings bring up questions about who exactly has access to footage collected by Flock surveillance cameras and where people reviewing the footage may be based. Flock has become a pervasive technology in the US, with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use every day to investigate things like carjackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock’s business—creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors US residents’ movements—means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs. Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by. Law enforcement are then able to search cameras nationwide to see where else a vehicle has driven. Authorities typically dig through this data without a warrant, leading the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation to recently sue a city blanketed in nearly 500 Flock cameras.

The standout here is the LED Series 2, which alone retails for $470 (and is not on sale), making this deal $48 less than the mask alone. In other words, it’s a steal even if you don’t plan to use the accompanying products. The LED Series 2 is the best red light therapy mask on the market. Crafted from medical-grade silicone, it hugs your face with 236 bulbs, ensuring direct contact. It delivers three wavelengths—red (633 nanometers), near-infrared (830 nanometers), and deep near-infrared (1072 nanometers)—to target skin rejuvenation at multiple depths. I’d recommend this splurge to people who’d like to target fine lines, wrinkles, or sun damage. Reviewer Nena Farrell also noted visible improvements in her acne scarring. Drybar Amazon Drybar Sephora We know and love Drybar, especially the Double Shot Oval, which, frankly, is the best blow-dryer brush we've tried. Reviewer Nena Farrell has fine, curly hair that tends to frizz, and she says the Double Shot can smooth it out and still deliver volume, thanks to its ionic technology and 2.4-inch oval barrel.

Let's move on.", "content": "My little theory is that the concept of “imprinting” in psychology can just as easily be applied to programming: Much as a baby goose decides that the first moving life-form it encounters is its parent, embryonic programmers form ineradicable attachments to the patterns and quiddities of their first formative language. For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described. My dislike for it was immediate. To arrive at a language late is to see it without the forgiving haze of sentimentality that comes with imprinting—the fond willingness to overlook a flaw as a quirk. What I saw wasn’t a bejeweled tool but a poor little thing that hadn’t quite gotten the news that the world of programming had moved on. Ruby was created in 1995 by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro Matsumoto, affectionately called “Matz.” Aside from creating the only major programming language to have originated outside the West, this Osaka-born practicing Mormon is also known for being exceptionally nice, so much so that the Ruby community adopted the motto MINASWAN, for “Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.” Befitting this, as well as its pretty name, Ruby is easy on the eyes. Its syntax is simple, free of semicolons or brackets. More so even than Python —a language known for its readability—Ruby reads almost like plain English.

The original V1 came out in 2006 , and the nameplate has been under constant production since. In that time, the DeathAdder has maintained its shape and ergonomics, but nearly everything else has changed. The mouse’s weight has halved, its polling rate has increased eightfold, and the maximum dots per inch (dpi) has increased by 25 times. To add to that, the new DeathAdder V4 Pro packs all of this into a wireless design. It's a great example of how far mouse technology has come over the past two decades. Over the years, I’ve watched mice progress in every way. With higher-performance sensors, improved switches, higher polling rates, and lower weights, it’s hard to argue that a mouse from 2006 is still competitive. At the same time, not all of those specs matter much to the average user. Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro Rating: 9/10 Sure, there’s a difference between 1,000- and 8,000-Hz polling, or 0.1 and 0.2 milliseconds of latency, but it's marginal compared to a new switch that feels better to press, a body that’s sturdy during use, or a design that saves 10 grams of weight. Time and time again, I find that the physical aspects of a mouse will have a much more direct and tangible impact on the user experience than any high-end internals. That’s what the DeathAdder V4 Pro gets right: It feels good to use. The buttons are snappy with a short travel distance but provide just enough resistance that resting your hand on them doesn’t risk a mis-input. The mouse wheel feels tight and notchy, with short ratchets that easily snap into place as you scroll. The overall shape is slightly sculpted, with a subtle ergonomic curve on either side. The mouse feels agile and responsive—it fits into your hand, but isn’t so sculpted that your hand sinks into it.

In November, for the first time since its launch in 2019, Meta shared with WIRED user information about Facebook Dating, and the figures landed to the sound of collective astonishment. Suddenly, the platform was a secret hit—and bigger than Hinge, its closest rival. Even more bewildering was how Facebook Dating seems to be slowly catching on among young people, with 1.77 million daily active US users between ages 18 and 29, a stat that challenges the idea that only boomers use Facebook. According to a Pew survey from last year, 32 percent of teen respondents said they use Facebook compared to 71 percent in 2015, though Facebook Dating notes that daily conversations among its 18-to-29 demographic increased by 24 percent in 2024. Facebook Dating is not like any other dating app on the market. It’s technically not even an app. Like Marketplace or Groups, it’s a service within the Facebook app. It also doesn’t depend on a subscription model like Bumble or Tinder, a major advantage when onboarding new users. That’s what Olivia Nwokoma, a 24-year-old hospitality worker in Maryland, likes about it the most. “It doesn’t block the better features behind a paywall,” she says.

It's Cyber Monday , you’re in the market for a new MacBook, and you’re likely wondering if you should buy the new M5 MacBook Pro .

In theory, that ensures you get the best performance and features, and will hopefully mean you won't have to replace it for many years. But in this case, you probably shouldn’t. Best Cyber Monday Tech Deals (2025) Explore the story That might come as a surprise coming from me, especially since my evaluation of the M5 MacBook Pro was quite positive . There’s a lot to like about it. The M5's performance is a solid step up over the M4 , especially in the GPU department. The stuff that hasn’t changed is still really high-quality, including the Mini-LED display, excellent speakers, and iconic design. It’s been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect. It’s even $200 off this Cyber Monday weekend , despite launching only a month ago. The problem is the position of this particular MacBook Pro in the lineup. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That’s a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air. Apple knows people will buy the MacBook Air this holiday season, especially at its sale price of $738. So, bringing the M5 exclusively to the 14-inch MacBook Pro feels like an easy way to boost sales on an otherwise overlooked laptop in the lineup.

Just a few weeks after the release of Brown’s new bestseller set in contemporary Prague, viewers were able to see for themselves what drew the popular writer to the festival, which is the largest Czech and Central European showcase of digital art.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier). We revise the rating to REDUCE (from SELL earlier) as the stock has reduced >7% over last month and we see limited downside from hereon.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The company faced multiple lawsuits across the US for “repeatedly” failing to protect consumer data, as per an AP report. AT&T informed millions of customers that their personal data, including Social Security numbers and call records, was compromised in two breaches in 2024. Reports said that the breaches affected over seven million of AT&T customers in 2024, and more than 65 million customers between 2019-2024. While it denies wrongdoing, in a statement to the media the company said it opted to settle to avoid a long legal battle. “We have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation. AT&T remains committed to protecting our customers’ data and ensuring their continued trust in us,” it stated. Customers in both data breaches are eligible for claims. The court has awarded two classes of settlements, based on different cases, which customers can file for separately. The settlement's cash funds total $177 million to pay those impacted by both of these breaches — which divvies up to $149 million for the first “settlement class” and another $28 million for the second, per a preliminary approval order filed in June. 2.

NEW DELHI : A push by the Centre to curb phone-based scams by mandating a government app on every smartphone in circulation is likely to be opposed by the world’s largest handset makers — including Apple, Google, Samsung — and even industry bodies, according to multiple executives Mint spoke with. The app, Sanchar Saathi, offers cyber security and surveillance features. A non-removable government app may hinder a person’s right to choose, may conflict with India’s newly-minted data-privacy regime, and impose onerous compliance requirements, the executives said on condition of anonymity since their companies were still evaluating the government order. On 28 November, the department of telecommunications (DoT) under the ministry of communications issued a notification to companies that sell mobile phones in India to mandatorily pre-install Sanchar Saathi on all new phones, and use software updates to load them on phones that are already in use. Companies were given 90 days to comply and 120 days to file a compliance report, and asked to ensure that the app cannot be disabled or uninstalled at any point. Mint has seen a copy of the notification. The DoT reinforced its message with a post on social media platform X on Monday evening. To be sure, India has about 750-800 million smartphone users, and just over 150 million smartphones are sold in India every year, as per IDC. Two senior executives at electronics companies, who were privy to the notifications directly, said DoT’s notification was served to reduce the misuse of mobile phones in various scams. “The notification clearly states that Sanchar Saathi must be preinstalled in all mobile phones in order to make it easier for the Centre to track nefarious activities,\" the first of the two executives said. “Their idea is that if a smartphone’s IMEI (international mobile equipment identity) number is blacklisted on Sanchar Saathi, having t", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/centres-order-to-pre-install-sanchar-saathi-app-on-all-smartphones-sparks-industry-concern-11764593502702.html", "timestamp": 1764641388.9338188}

Dozens of companies have filed lawsuits in the US Court of International Trade since late October, where they have challenged Donald Trump's use of powers meant for an economic emergency to impose tariffs, and now the biggest warehouse club chain in the country has decided to follow suit. Costco is one of the biggest companies to jump into the ring in this case which is being driven by smaller businesses and state officials with Democratic leanings. The arguments on Trump tariffs were heard by the US Supreme Court on November 5. The case was put on a fast-track schedule by the judges presiding over the same, who, however, have not clarified when the intend on passing the judgement in the case. Businesses, meanwhile, have been suing the Trump government to avoid the uncertainty regarding their refund eligibility in case the court ruling goes against the US President. As per Costco lawyers, the complaint, filed on 28 November was a result of the uncertainty regarding the guarantee of refunds for all companies that have been paying additional duties if SCOTUS declares Trump tariffs to be illegal. The lawsuit, however, has not specified how much the company had to pay because of the additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company said that intervention from the court is required at the earliest since it's request for extension of the schedule for finalising tariffs were denied by the US Customs and Border Protection. This could jeopardise the company's chances of seeking full refunds in future, as per Bloomberg .

Boca Raton Police Department has confirmed that the rapper, whose real name is Carlito Milfort Jr., passed away at the age of 26 after an \"incident\" at an address which they chose to not reveal officially. A number of fan comments on the rapper social media profiles seem to suggest that he died by suicide, however authorities have not confirmed this claim yet. The Palm Beach Country Medical Examiner has, however, said that the cause of death is still under investigation. TMZ spoke to an employee at the Boca Raton hotel, who revealed that the rapper was taken to a local hospital on Saturday morning owing to a medical emergency. He had been living in the establishment for 10 days and had checked in with a woman and a toddler. There was no other report of injury at the hotel on Saturday. POORSTACY hailed from Palm Beach, Florida, and was an up-and-coming artist adept at blending of genres like rock, punk, and emo rap. POORSTACY was nominated for a Grammy Award for featuring on the soundtrack of the movie Bill & Ted Face the Music. He has also frequently collaborated with Travis Barker, the drummer for Blink-182. The duo worked on three songs together, with the most successful among them being Choose Life . He had also worked with Oli Sykes, the frontman of the band Bring Me the Horizon, collaborating on the track Knife Party . His first EP, I Don't Care, which dropped in 2019, made fans and peers take notice of his talents.

Here’s what every borrower needs to know to protect their repayments and future relief.", "content": "The United States’ student loan system is on the cusp of one of its most sweeping overhauls in decades, with a series of major reforms scheduled to begin unfolding within weeks. As the Education Department races to implement provisions of US President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA), millions of borrowers will see their repayment options and eventual loan-forgiveness pathways radically reshaped — and some benefits will disappear entirely. One of the first changes arriving before the end of December is a significant expansion of the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. Previously, borrowers were required to demonstrate a “partial financial hardship” to qualify. Trump’s “big beautiful bill” eliminates that barrier, opening IBR to higher earners and most federal student loan holders. The Education Department acknowledged that its systems were still denying eligible applicants earlier this autumn. Under a settlement with the American Federation of Teachers, officials confirmed the updates will be completed by late December. Until then, “servicers will hold IBR applications that would otherwise be denied,” according to new federal guidance. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz said the removal of the hardship test will allow many borrowers previously excluded from IBR to finally access it. Under the scheme, borrowers typically pay 10% of discretionary income — although older loans may require 15% — with forgiveness coming after 20 or 25 years. The easier entry into IBR coincides with the gradual disappearance of several other repayment options. Trump’s tax and spending package ended the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan and set a July 2028 sunset for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Some 2.5 million people currently use ICR or PAYE , according to Kantrowitz. Many ICR borrowers will pay less under IBR, while those on PAYE — especially borrowers who took loans after July 2014 — may see little change.

Out of a total of 64 cases, 45 people died and 19 others recovered, according to the Congolese health ministry. From the early days of the outbreak, Congo used a revamped national surveillance system to enable authorities to rapidly map the affected area and contain transmission. \"Controlling and ending this Ebola outbreak in three months is a remarkable achievement,\" WHO regional director Dr Mohamed Janabi said in a statement. Congo will now begin a 90-day period of enhanced disease surveillance, the statement said. The Ebola outbreak was the Central African nation's 16th since the disease was first identified in 1976, according to the WHO. There have been no new cases since September 25, and the last Ebola patient was discharged on October 19. Two maximum incubation periods of 21 days each must pass without the detection of new cases before an outbreak can be declared officially over. The Ebola virus, a rare but often fatal illness in humans, is endemic to Congo's vast tropical forests. It is transmitted through contact with blood and other bodily fluids and causes symptoms including fever, body aches, and diarrhoea.

The ruling, delivered in absentia, accuses Panahi of “propaganda activities” against the Iranian regime — a familiar charge in repeated legal cases against the director over the years. The verdict comes just months after Panahi — aged 65 — achieved one of the greatest accolades in world cinema. His latest film, ‘It Was Just an Accident’, won the 2025 Cannes Film Festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or. In that film, a group of former inmates confront a man they believe to be their former jailer, a story that many critics see as a sharp allegory for state repression and a bold act of cinematic defiance. Panahi had spent much of the past two decades navigating severe restrictions: after openly supporting anti-government protests in 2009, he was convicted in 2010 of “propaganda against the system” and received a six-year prison sentence as well as a 20-year ban on filmmaking , international travel, and media appearances. Undeterred, he refused to remain silent. During his house arrest, he co-directed ‘This Is Not a Film’ (2011), a stark documentary made in his apartment that was smuggled out of Iran on a USB drive and screened at Cannes — a daring act of artistic resistance. He later succeeded with films like ‘Taxi’ (2015), shot entirely inside a car, which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival . After years of bans and hidden productions, Panahi resurrected his public presence this year — returning to Cannes for the first time in over 20 years for the premiere of ‘It Was Just an Accident’.

Calling Habba a “tireless advocate for justice” in his statement last year and who had been \"unwavering in her loyalty,\" Trump had named Habba as interim US Attorney General for New Jersey in March. On Monday, 1 December, a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Habba was unlawfully appointed as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey and disqualified her from supervising cases. Alina Habba – 41-years-old – was once a relatively lesser-known litigator who came to represent Trump in some of his most perilous cases – including one, where she notably clashed with a judge during a defamation trial, mentioned a report by BBC. After graduating from university, Habba took a job in the fashion industry, working at Marc Jacobs - one of America's premier brands. She returned to college after several years in the industry, earning her law degree from Widener University, a small school in Pennsylvania, in 2010. She went on to serve briefly as a clerk for then–New Jersey Superior Court Judge Eugene Codey Jr before shifting to private practice. After several years in the field, she founded her own law firm in 2020. A mother of three – Habba – joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey - where her law firm is also based. The latest disqualification of Habba as New Jersey attorney comes amid the push by Trump's Republican administration to keep Habba as the acting US attorney for the state – a powerful post charged with enforcing federal criminal and civil law, reported AP. Earlier this year, in August, a federal judge ruled that Habba’s appointment was “unlawful,” though the judge’s order was on hold as the legal proceedings continued in an appeals court. In the summer ruling, US District J", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/who-is-alina-habba-trumps-ex-personal-lawyer-tireless-advocate-for-justice-disqualified-from-serving-new-jersey-11764607008288.html", "timestamp": 1764641391.505689}

Experts warn that temporary staffing solutions are inadequate to address serious understaffing issues in India's rapidly expanding aviation market.", "content": "New Delhi/Mumbai: India is planning to appoint short-term contractual staff at its civil aviation regulator, which is facing a severe shortage of manpower at a time when the country's aviation market is expanding rapidly. Short-term appointments could be for one year, depending on the post or nature of work, and are generally made directly by the regulator. Of the sanctioned 1,630 posts at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), 801 posts are vacant, minister of state for civil aviation Murlidhar Mohol informed the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Previous submissions made in the Lok Sabha showed that 814 out of 1,692 sanctioned positions at the DGCA remained vacant as of 31 March 2025. DGCA had 878 staff as of 31 March 2025. “...to meet the requirement in the interregnum, efforts are made to recruit persons through short term contractual hiring. Regular efforts are made to address and augment technical manpower shortage, enhanced training and succession planning,” Mohol said in a written response to the upper house of Parliament. He said 441 posts have been created during “the last 3 years as a part of DGCA restructuring”. “Out of total 1,630 sanctioned strength of DGCA, 829 posts are currently filled,” Mohol said, adding that the “shortfall has not impacted the surveillance plans of DGCA.” On 21 July 2025, about 40 days after the Air India crash that killed 241 people and raised concerns over the DGCA’s chronic staffing shortages, Mohol said the regulator had created 441 new posts between 2022 and 2024, including 426 technical roles. Of the DGCA’s 1,644 sanctioned posts, 823 remain vacant. Thus, between July and November, there has been a reduction in sanctioned posts by about 1%, while vacancy levels remain around 50%. Between 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2025, the DGCA has added 116 employees, as its workforce rose from 762 to 878. However, according to Parliament discussion records reviewed by Mint, the number of unfilled positions has jumped from 471 to 814.

Zia, the 80-year-old Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson, was admitted to a private hospital on November 23 when she developed a chest infection that affected both her heart and lungs. He further offered heartfelt prayers and wishes for her swift recovery, adding that India is prepared to provide any support needed in this difficult time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, said, “Deeply concerned to learn about the health of Begum Khaleda Zia, who has contributed to Bangladesh’s public life for many years. Our sincere prayers and best wishes for her speedy recovery. India stands ready to extend all possible support, in whatever way we can.” Zia is “extremely unwell”, and she has been placed on ventilation, with both local and international medical specialists overseeing her treatment, her party leaders said on Monday, as reported by PTI. Four days later, the three-time prime minister was shifted to the coronary care unit after several of her health complications worsened. Her condition has deteriorated, and she was put on ventilation, BNP Vice-Chairman Advocate Ahmed Aazam Khan was quoted as saying by news portal tbsnews.net. \"She is in a very critical condition.

Zia, the wife of slain Bangladesh president Ziaur Rahman, has been suffering from multiple other health complications, including liver and kidney issues, diabetes, arthritis, and eye-related illnesses.

This year’s display features no fewer than 51 Christmas trees across the White House. The official tree — an 18½-foot concolor fir from Korson's Tree Farms in Michigan — will take pride of place in the Blue Room, as is tradition. The fir was delivered in horse-drawn carriage by a pair of Clydesdale horses, a nod to nostalgic festive pageantry. The Blue Room tree carries special significance this year: it honours “Gold Star” families — families who have lost loved ones in active military service. The decorations include more than 2,800 gold stars, plus ornaments representing each U.S. state’s official bird and flower, symbolising hope, unity and remembrance. Meanwhile, the Green Room takes on a playful, family-orientated spirit. Here, the décor transforms the space into a kind of “game room,” with playing cards, dominoes and even LEGO portraits of two U.S. presidents — the country’s first, George Washington, and the incumbent, Donald Trump — each crafted from over 6,000 LEGO pieces. In the State Dining Room, a striking gingerbread model of the White House — built from 120 pounds of gingerbread dough — gives an edible (though not to be eaten) miniature recreation of the mansion’s South Portico and offers a peek inside the private residence’s Yellow Oval Room. The decorations have been curated to reflect more than just holiday cheer. Mrs. Trump’s theme celebrates the home as a place of love, warmth and shared memories — values she says are especially poignant during times of movement and change.

The decision was taken by a panel of three appellate judges with the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld a lower court's finding that the Trump administration broke the law by using a series of manoeuvres to install Habba as US attorney for New Jersey after the 41-year-old failed to get the Senate's approval. “It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" the Circuit Court of Appeals observed, noting that \"the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the US Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability,\" as per a report by the Associated Press (AP) . “Under the Government’s delegation theory, Habba may avoid the gauntlet of presidential appointment and Senate confirmation and serve as the de facto US Attorney indefinitely. This view is so broad that it bypasses the constitutional (appointment and Senate confirmation) process entirely,\" CNN quoted the panel as writing in its 32-page opinion. “We will affirm the District Court’s disqualification order,\" the panel concluded. The decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold Habba's disqualification comes at a time when the Trump administration has been pushing to keep the 41-year-old as the acting US attorney for New Jersey, a post that carries the responsibility of enforcing federal criminal and civil law within its jurisdiction. It also comes on the back of several judges questioning the Trump administration's moves to keep Habba in the post despite the expiry of her interim appointment and her failure to get Senate confirmation.
