A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021. Underlining the relevance of a single higher education regulator, the NEP-2020 document says, “The regulatory system needs a complete overhaul to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.” It adds that the new system should ensure the distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting are ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/winter-session-parliament-to-take-up-bill-replacing-ugc-aicte-ncte-with-single-regulator-10381204/", "timestamp": 1764160189.0150657}

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

Times Higher Education is a UK-based magazine that releases an annual ranking of global and Asian universities, among others. The rankings, conducted in association with Schmidt Science Fellows, aim to benchmark how universities foster research that cuts across traditional academic boundaries. One of the key changes in this year’s edition is an expanded definition of “interdisciplinary science.” In addition to traditional STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) research, ISR 2026 now includes projects that combine scientific disciplines with non-STEM fields such as social sciences, law, economics, education, and clinical health. The methodology behind the ranking relies on three core pillars, as per the press release.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Nine prominent business schools in India have already partnered as ‘Member Business School’ in this centre, and they will get the direct knowledge-sharing benefit, he added. Director (Product & Publishing) of Ivey Publishing, Violetta Gallagher, said the CRC launch marks the opening of new pathways for collaboration, storytelling, and impact in India and around the world. Gallagher stated that Indian (research) cases include 16 per cent of the Ivey Publishing collection, which is overwhelming. “At the same time, it is an opportunity to see Indian content that is relevant not just locally but globally”, she said, adding that the CRC is a story engine capable of capturing the unique narratives emerging from India’s dynamic business environment. Gallagher said Ivey Publishing published around 500 cases a year, and about 30 per cent of our authors are from India. “This is an exciting number which continues to grow”, she said.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764160214.2604845}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation. In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew.

For its core technology, the company uses what’s called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup’s model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description. “Let’s say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly.

Now, the human safety operator is gone.", "content": "A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless. The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking.

In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion , up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024. Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses. Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant. “Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch. Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny , SaaS.group , Arising Ventures , and Calm Capital , according to Dumont. “Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said. In 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment. Since then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel. “It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it.

The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “ Your Custom Feed .” The new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want. For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future. While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options. YouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.

The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week. The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all. “Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.” Interactive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted. On the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move. “I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote. Another said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.” It remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots.

Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice.

During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen.

WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.” WMG also announced that it has sold Songkick , a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business. WMG says Songkick will continue as a fan destination under Suno. As a result of WMG’s partnership, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models that will replace its current ones next year.

The tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point. Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season, which could be a boon for AI shopping startups like Phia , Cherry , or Deft (rebranded as Onton) — but with OpenAI and Perplexity pushing further into AI shopping experiences, are these startups in danger? Zach Hudson, CEO of the interior design shopping tool Onton , thinks that AI shopping startups with a specialized niche will still provide a better experience to users than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. “Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources,” Hudson told TechCrunch. “Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google. That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.” Daydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she remarked to TechCrunch over the summer that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well. “Fashion … is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/openai-and-perplexity-are-launching-ai-shopping-assistants-but-competing-startups-arent-sweating-it/", "timestamp": 1764160537.5441542}

The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated.

Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including OpenAI and Anthropic have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products. Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.” Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless ” and pocket-sized . Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io , to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco. Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes. “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said. The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted.

The feature had a tenuous rollout — Martin Luther King Jr.’s estate had to get involved, to give you an idea of what went on — but now it faces a new challenge. Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.” U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word “cameo,” as well as any similar-sounding words or phrases, on Sora. The temporary restraining order issued on November 21, 2025 is set to expire on December 22, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. As of Monday afternoon, the Sora app still uses the “cameo” language, however. “We are gratified by the court’s decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. “While the court’s order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.” OpenAI disagrees with the assertion that the company can claim exclusive ownership over the word “cameo,” the company told CNBC.

The warning, issued Monday by the CSPC, is due to a risk that the batteries can ignite or explode. The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission. “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding. The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity. The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.” (The Verge first reported Rad Power’s disagreement with the CPSC.) Rad Power claimed its batteries comply with “the highest industry standards” and said the “incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent.” “While that ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/rad-power-bikes-batteries-receive-major-fire-risk-warning/", "timestamp": 1764160538.6469781}

Tesla claimed in a weekend social media post that Dutch regulator RDW was set to approve the use of its driver assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving, or FSD, in February 2026. The organization handles the licensing and registration of vehicles in the Netherlands and is seen as a critical step for Tesla to get approval for — and eventually roll out — FSD to consumers across Europe. “RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,” Tesla wrote in the post. It seems RDW isn’t quite in line with Tesla. The Dutch regulator clarified in a statement on their website that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February. Bloomberg was first to report on RDW’s statement. “RDW and Tesla know what efforts need to be made to make a decision on this in February. Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads. Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times. FSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.

The deepfakes that followed reveal a growing digital blackface problem.", "content": "When DoorDash delivery driver Livie Rose Henderson posted a video alleging that one of her customers sexually assaulted her in October, it set off a firestorm of reactions. Henderson’s TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer’s front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok’s algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson’s November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.) None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose. But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash’s decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer’s personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jeff Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.” “Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.” “Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off.

NASA and Boeing are now targeting no earlier than April 2026 to fly the uncrewed Starliner-1 mission, the space agency said. Launching by next April will require completion of rigorous test, certification, and mission readiness activities, NASA added in a statement . “NASA and Boeing are continuing to rigorously test the Starliner propulsion system in preparation for two potential flights next year,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in a statement. NASA also said it has reached an agreement with Boeing to modify the Commercial Crew contract, signed in 2014, that called for six crewed flights to the space station following certification of the spacecraft. Now the plan is to fly Starliner-1 carrying cargo, and then up to three additional missions before the space station is retired. “This modification allows NASA and Boeing to focus on safely certifying the system in 2026, execute Starliner’s first crew rotation when ready, and align our ongoing flight planning for future Starliner missions based on station’s operational needs through 2030,” Stich said. SpaceX and Boeing were both awarded contracts in 2014 to develop crewed spacecraft and fly six operational missions to the space station. SpaceX, with its Crew Dragon vehicle, flew a successful crew test flight in mid-2020 and its first operational mission before the end of that year.

After all, Kohler is big—one of the biggest family-owned manufacturing empires in the country. And the stuff it sells is big. And so Kohler's Black Friday sale likewise thinks big, offering discounts on life-changing bathroom and kitchen installations. Enter the promo code BFCM25, and you'll get 5 percent off bath and kitchen orders above $800, and 10 percent off orders bigger than $1,600. Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars. Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough) . But then a decade later, Kohler quite literally invented the bathtub—a clawfoot design still popular today among those with a yen for nostalgia. By the 1910s, according to their company history, Kohler also inaugurated the “integrated-apron” bathtub that's in more common use today. So Kohler knows how to make a bathtub, is what we're saying—including a wide variety of hydrotherapy models—and handsome shower fixtures. Modern bathroom collections from Kohler include decor sets designed by lifestyle influencers like Jenn Lake or Jenni Yolo , as well as some people who are not named Jennifer.

As mentioned, we at WIRED love OnePlus because of the affordable price point while maintaining solid quality. The newest iteration of the OnePlus 12 impressed us. One of the biggest drawbacks in previous models was the camera quality, but OnePlus has done a lot of work to improve it in the past few years and it’s now on level with competitors like Samsung. Our senior reviews editor and tech overlord Julian Chokkattu called the newest iteration a “Very Good Phone” (high praise from him). It also charges with blazing speed.

From the constant 4:20 references to his quote tweet “dunks” to awarding “ Certified Bangers ” badges to silly X posts, Musk’s desperation for validation knows no bounds. It can get pretty annoying when the richest guy on earth makes a joke and then awkwardly eyes the room waiting for everyone to laugh. But over the weekend, I was intrigued when a clip emerged of Musk telling Joe Rogan that using Grok’s Unhinged Mode to deliver an “epic vulgar roast” is a surefire way to “make people really laugh at a party.” “Point the camera at them, and now do a vulgar roast of this person … then keep saying, ‘no, no, make it even more vulgar. Use forbidden words,’” Musk excitedly tells Rogan in the clip taken from their three-hour-plus conversation published on Rogan’s podcast in October. “Eventually it's like, holy fuck, you know. I mean it’s trying to jam a rocket up your ass and have it explode. It’s next level. Beyond fucking belief,” he continues, chuckling and even raising his arms above his head at the mere thought. The best roast jokes tend to be smart, reflect a familiarity with the person being roasted, and contain just the right amount of mean. It’s not a task one would think a large language model would be great at. But, with Thanksgiving and holiday season on the horizon, I figured why not test Musk’s claim that Grok can deliver a foul-mouthed razz with the best of them? I gave it a test spin at the office by turning Grok loose on my colleagues. (I do not recommend anyone else do this at work.) Three of my coworkers and I set up shop in my boss’s office so I could privately undertake the embarrassing task of telling Grok to roast all of us one by one.

After all, some people want a simpler entry into the world of PC gaming that doesn't involve tinkering. That's where a PC like the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes into play—in theory. While Alienware typically addresses the higher-end demographic with its gaming desktops and laptops, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is the company's most serious attempt yet to offer its gaming goods at a lower price. Overall, I've been happy with what you get with the Aurora, especially when I've seen sales that dip the price to $1,500. I recently reviewed the Dell Tower Plus , a prebuilt desktop I liked quite a lot. Turns out, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is almost identical to that PC, but with the Alienware branding (Dell owns Alienware). You get a ring of Tron -esque light around the intake fans at the front, as well as the smattering of honeycomb perforations along the glass window in the side panel. And the alien head itself is the power button. Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop Rating: 7/10 It’s accurate to say that the Aurora feels like a gamer skin on the Dell Tower Plus, but that’s not a complaint. I found a lot to like about the way Dell balanced ease of use, upgradability, and price—and it translates well enough for gaming hardware. It’s not using fully off-the-shelf parts, but there’s enough here to make specific upgrades well into the future. Like the Dell Tower Plus, the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes in a custom case with an Intel Z890 Alienware motherboard, which has two DIMM slots of memory and two PCIe 5 M.2 slots for SSDs. Even though a standard ATX or Micro-ATX motherboard would fit, swapping in a new one would be difficult due to the use of proprietary connectors. An AMD CPU is a better option for prebuilt desktops like this, as you might be able to upgrade in future generations because AMD supports the same socket in a way that Intel does not.

The soundstage isn't quite as expansive as some of the very best, but it gets most of the way there without costing nearly as much. Similarly, the active noise canceling doesn't match the performance on the big hitters like Sony or Bose , but excellent fit and passive isolation pick up the slack. They have quite a few thoughtful design touches that make them easy to love. A small red dot on the right ear cup makes sure they always go on your head the right way, rather than trying to read a little letter on the inside of a band.

From the best mattresses for back pain to our favorite cooling options , these are the top deals on mattresses the WIRED Reviews team has tested in their own homes. We also track prices all year to see where the best sales are really happening. So, if it’s on this list, it's genuinely a good deal. Heads-up: While the prices listed below are for queen sizes, the deals should apply to all mattress sizes. Your dreams of a new king mattress are still going strong.

We’ve updated this list to reflect which sales are legit and which ones are not really any different than sales we’ve seen earlier this year. The WIRED Reviews team has crowned the Bear Elite Hybrid as the best mattress for back pain we’ve tested to date. It comes in three firmness options, including Soft, Medium, and Firm. WIRED testers have found Firm helpful for spinal alignment, and you can also add a Celliant cover for a fee, designed to help with muscle recovery. In addition to the sale, Bear is also throwing in a free accessories bundle (two pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector ). Use WIRED40 for 40 percent off , which is an additional 5 percent off the current offer on the site. We test many, many mattresses—so it’s saying something that the Helix Midnight Luxe has been our favorite overall mattress for seven years running.

Every year, I test a dozen or more devices to find the best cheap phones that perform where it counts and aren’t annoyingly slow. Wireless carriers in the US go out of their way to make expensive smartphones seem affordable. AT&T will advertise a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for just $36 a month, but don't let that fool you. With over 36 monthly installments, you spend over a thousand bucks on a phone. Your pricey device may also keep you locked into the network, unable to switch wireless carriers until the phone is paid off. Get a seriously great, affordable smartphone instead. That's especially important in today's tariff-rich environment . Our top pick, the Google Pixel 9a , costs $499 and is as good as almost any flagship device.

If you want a great deal on a cheap phone that came out in 2025, then yes. However, cheap phones typically launch in the first half of the year, so that means we're not far from the 2026 models of many of these options. For example, the iPhone 16e arrived in February of 2025, so an iPhone 17e may launch around the same time in 2026. Motorola has already started launching its 2026 Moto G lineup, starting with the Moto G Play 2026. If you're not in a rush and would prefer the latest model, wait a few months.

That's at least part of the reasoning behind the existence of the LG UltraFine Evo 6K. This 32-inch monitor aims to put even more pixels in front of content creators and professionals.

It's one of the best monitors you can buy for content creators, despite some of the unfortunate trade-offs it comes with. The 32-inch LG UltraFine Evo 6K is a very pretty monitor. I wouldn't blame you for mistaking this as an Apple product, given the focus on clean lines, simple shapes, and designerly aesthetic. The extra-wide stand means that the base itself isn’t overly large. Like the Apple Studio Display , the flat base provides more usable desk space rather than occupying it. The stand itself has a unique design, too. It resembles the styling Apple uses on the iMac and Studio Display, but it has a textured pattern on the back. It’s gorgeous, though you probably won’t spend a lot of time looking at the back of the monitor unless your desk is in the middle of the room or in command position (if you know, you know). LG UltraFine Evo 6K Monitor Rating: 7/10 I also like that the back of the cabinet is flat, giving it a sleek look that the rounded backs of typical monitors can’t achieve. Because it uses conventional backlighting, though, it’s not as thin as OLED displays like some of Samsung’s Odyssey gaming monitors . The UltraFine 6K also has some impressively thin bezels, too, adding to the ultra-modern aesthetic. While they’re not “virtually borderless” as LG states, they’re smaller than the bezels on most monitors I’ve tested. One of my favorite aspects of the UltraFine Evo 6K is the speakers. The pair of included speakers on this might be the best I've heard on a monitor. They are extremely loud and clear.

While doing so, Coleman singled out the work of one self-described “predator hunter” who claims to have helped identify alleged abusers mixing with young gamers. “Roblox is even trying to silence those who raised these security risks,” Coleman said. “The famous case of one of their developers, Schlep, immediately comes to mind.” Schlep is in fact Michael, a 22-year-old Texan who has spent the last two years working with a group of other Roblox players to track down and identify people purportedly seeking to groom young children on the platform—predators like the one Schlep says allegedly groomed him a decade ago, which he says led him to try to take his own life. In the process of attempting to out suspected groomers, Schlep—who doesn’t share his surname for privacy reasons—has amassed 2.3 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he highlights what he believes to be the shortcomings of Roblox’s safety features and reveals the identities of the alleged predators he has tracked down. But on August 8, Schlep received a cease-and-desist letter from Roblox, and instantly, all of his accounts were banned. His predator hunter days were over. “While Roblox acknowledges that your stated intentions may be to protect children, and while it recognizes the serious nature of online predatory behavior, your methods, including failing to immediately report suspicious activity to Roblox through proper channels, are actively interfering with Roblox’s established safety protocols and, critically, are exposing Roblox’s users to increased risk,” the company wrote in the letter reviewed by WIRED.

This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance. Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane , chaga , and cordyceps —boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool.

Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works.

You can grab an Oura Ring 4 for just $249 from Amazon , a $100 break from the normal price. It's compatible with both iOS and Android apps, has a battery that last for days, and accurately tracks a ton of health data, from hiking and sleeping to period predictions and food intake. Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability. The sensors have been recessed further into the body of the ring itself, which reduces the overall thickness considerably and allows for a wider available range of ring sizes. They also cover a wider portion of the ring, so there's no need to keep it oriented in one specific direction to get proper readings. The battery life has improved a lot as well. The older Oura 3 could run for around three days before it needed a charge, Our reviewer, Adrienne So, reported that the Ring 4 tracked a full weekend of hiking and physical activity, as well as a music festival, and still had enough juice for at least a couple more days. You get a ton of health and physical fitness data from the ring, which is neatly sorted into daily physical data, detailed vitals, and longer trends over time, all organized in the app on your phone. If you want to also keep track of your food intake, a new Meals feature lets you take photos of what you eat and then track its effects on your body. Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes. Thankfully, the mirrored silver and classic black are marked down to the lower $249 price point, with varying discounts on the other options, like $299 for the brushed silver ,", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/oura-ring-4-deal-1125/", "timestamp": 1764160544.8227808}

The console you spent countless hours huddled around as a kid is now old enough to be crippled by student debt and burdened with existential despair, just like you! If that reminder of the cruel and ceaseless march of time makes you want to retreat into a nostalgic bubble when life was easier and, say, play some N64 games, unfortunately, that's been pretty tricky in recent years. Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly due to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs in terms of connectivity or resolution. Analogue 3D Rating: 9/10 Enter, then, the Analogue3D, the latest console from the makers of the Analogue Pocket . Like its portable predecessor, this is a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) piece of kit that perfectly mimics the original console, allowing you to play authentic game carts without emulation. It goes beyond being a third-party remake though—it runs those games better than ever thanks to a baked-in virtualized Expansion Pak and the ability to overclock, beautifully presenting games with a host of display options, and outputting it all in glorious 4K. Throw in universal support for N64 carts and accessories from anywhere in the world, meaning the region lockouts of the '90s are literally a thing of the past, and this might just be my favorite \"new\" console of 2025.

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet cofounded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him. Nnormal Backcountry Nnormal Nnormal's aim is to institute sustainable practices into manufacturing gear. “Probably the most important system is the most complicated,” Jornet said. “It's very costly to be constantly rotating things … how can we have [a company] that's not based on overconsumption?” The solution was to create incredibly durable running shoes that only have to be swapped out every two to four years. For the thousands of miles that he covered for States of Elevation, Jornet only swapped between two pairs of Nnormal shoes.

Like many folks of a certain age, my love of video games was born amid the bleeps and bloops of an arcade. These smoky, dark dens of gaming iniquity used to be everywhere, enticing you in with flashing marquees, simple synth melodies, and crunchy 8-bit explosions. As soon as I got my hands on a joystick and mashed a few buttons, I was hooked. While home arcade machines will never compete with a fully fledged arcade, good arcades are few and far between nowadays, unless you can manage a trip to Tokyo . You could snag one of the best retro game consoles for under the TV, but there’s something special about the controls and the artwork of a home arcade machine, and they give you a chance to play classic games with your family and friends the way the designers intended. Updated November 2025: We added the G'AIM'E Time Crisis Premium Light Gun, dimensions for each cabinet, and updated prices. Are Home Arcade Machines Worth It? Most home arcade machines are at least as expensive as the latest game consoles, sometimes far more expensive. They usually come with several games included, but they are still a considerable investment, so think carefully before you buy. Don’t get hung up on how many titles are included. It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal. ROMs (read-only memory) in the context of retro gaming are digital copies of video games. If you own a physical game and rip the contents to make your own backup copy, that’s within your rights, but it is illegal to dist", "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-home-arcade-machines/", "timestamp": 1764160545.485268}

{"id": "49efe015cec641129772304cf6d55852", "title": "5 things you should do when you wake up", "summary": "", "content": "The first hour after waking is crucial. Your body's internal timing system needs proper cues: water, sunlight, movement. These habits compound over time, improving sleep quality, mood stability, and sustained energy without depending on caffeine crashes or afternoon slumps. After 7 to 8 hours asleep, you're naturally dehydrated. Drink a full glass of room-temperature or lukewarm water immediately. This rehydrates cells, kickstarts metabolism, aids digestion, and flushes overnight toxins. Skip coffee for now; water first always works better. Step outside or near a bright window for 5 to 10 minutes. Morning sunlight resets your circadian rhythm, boosts serotonin, and signals your body it's time to be alert. Even on cloudy days, natural light works. Your sleep-wake cycle depends on this simple exposure. Stretch, do light yoga, walk around the block. Gentle movement loosens tight muscles, increases blood flow, and preps your nervous system for the day. You don't need intense exercise; just activate your body. This beats grogginess far better than rushing straight to tasks. Protein, healthy fat, complex carbs: think eggs with whole-grain toast, oatmeal with nuts, or a smoothie with spinach and banana. Eating early stabilizes blood sugar, sharpens focus, and reduces afternoon energy crashes. Skipping breakfast amplifies fatigue and cravings later on. No phone, no email, no social media yet. Your brain needs a wind-up period. Screen-time triggers stress hormones and mental drain before you've even started. Read, journal, meditate, or simply sit quietly. This buffer protects your mental resilience and keeps cortisol in check.  ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/5-things-you-should-do-when-you-wake-up/slideshow/125589760.cms", "timestamp": 1764160562.047601}

These five winter‑exclusive blooms offer a stunning palette for anyone looking to savor nature’s artistry when mercury drops.​", "content": "When much of nature takes a break, winter blooms explode in color across India’s gardens and parks. These flowers show up only when the air gets cold. You’ll spot these winter wonders in Srinagar’s Mughal gardens, Ooty’s parks, Delhi’s Lodhi Garden, and even balconies with a touch of strategic shade. Local nurseries often carry these seeds by late autumn. Primroses thrive in northern India’s cool winters, delivering bold pinks, yellows and purples in pots and shady beds. Their clusters brighten snowy Himalayan landscapes and add a pop of color to drab city balconies. Cineraria dazzles with its unusual daisy-like petals in shades of blue, violet, and magenta. Prized for ornamental gardens, this annual attracts attention in Delhi, Shimla, and Ooty once temperatures dip. Iceland poppies burst forth in radiant oranges, whites, and reds only during winter in India, especially in hill stations. Their delicate, papery blooms swaying in crisp morning air offer pure joie de vivre. Sweet peas bring fragrance and pastel shades to North Indian gardens, trailing on trellises and fences. They grow best in winter and don’t survive India’s heat, making their short display especially cherished. Alyssum blankets garden edges with tiny, honey-scented white and violet clusters in winter. With its quick growth and easy care, this plant becomes a favorite for city dwellers needing a floral pick-me-up.

Each veggie on this list boosts health as much as taste. Eating seasonal and fresh means your body gets the right nutrition to stay active, fight infections, and keep energy levels high. Carrots shine in winter. Packed with beta-carotene, which your body converts to Vitamin A, they’re brilliant for night vision and strong skin. Munch them raw, toss into soups, or try a simple carrot halwa. Their potassium content also helps balance fluid levels. Spinach, the humble “palak,” is iron-rich and brimming with Vitamin C and folate (also called Vitamin B9). It supports blood health and keeps anemia away. Wilt it into curries, parathas, or use as a salad base for a deep green hit of nutrition. Winter peas are a revelation. Their high fiber content supports gut health and stable energy. Peas provide protein and trace elements like manganese and phosphorus that bolster bones and immunity. Try in matar paneer or sprinkle in your poha for a sweeter crunch. Cauliflower is not just for “gobi paratha.” It contains phytochemicals called glucosinolates that support detoxification in the liver. A solid source of Vitamin C and folate, cauliflower is easy to roast in the oven or add to mixed veggies and winter sabzi. Turnip, or “shalgam,” sometimes gets overlooked. It is high in Vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Turmeric-paired turnip curry is a northern treat. Regular intake helps skin glow and maintains hydration, making it a great addition in colds and dry winter air. Beetroot brings color and power. Its nitrates boost blood flow, which is good for heart health and exercise stamina. Beets are full of manganese and help in proper nerve function. Grate into salads, mix in rotis, or blend as juice for a sweet, earthy dose.  ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/6-winter-vegetables-which-are-actually-nutrient-powerhouses/slideshow/125589288.cms", "timestamp": 1764160562.8054817}

Building strong thighs and calves boosts confidence, walking power, and even helps prevent injuries. Give your lower body the same love you give your arms, and you might hear “Wow, those aren’t chicken legs anymore!” Squats train your quadriceps (front thigh muscle) and gluteus maximus (biggest buttock muscle) in a single move. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Lower your body by bending your knees and hips, then push back up. Start with three sets of ten squats. Forget the gym: you can do this anywhere. Lunges work your quadriceps, hamstrings (back of thigh), and calves together. Step one foot forward, bending both knees to ninety degrees, then step back and change sides. This move helps you build joint stability and power for everyday activities like climbing stairs. Calf raises focus on your gastrocnemius and soleus muscles (your main calf muscles). Stand upright, then push up onto your toes and slowly lower back down. Try three sets of twenty repetitions. Calf raises improve ankle strength and make your calves look much more defined. Lie on your back, bend your knees, and keep your feet flat. Lift your hips as high as possible, squeeze your gluteus maximus at the top, then lower down. Glute bridges target your backside and the lower part of your hamstrings, helping you get rid of “flat” leg appearance. Find a secure bench or step. Step up with one foot, then bring up the other. Step down and repeat, swapping the lead leg each time. This simple move challenges all your leg muscles and mimics everyday actions, building genuine power for real life. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

This simple morning ritual is backed by research and costs nothing but time.​", "content": "A brief morning breathing session rewires how your body handles stress all day. It costs zero rupees, needs no equipment, and works in your bedroom. By morning's end, you've already quieted your nervous system before chaos arrives. Inhale through nose for four counts. Hold for seven. Exhale through mouth for eight. Repeat five times minimum. The longer exhale activates vagal tone. Your nervous system interprets this as safety. Practiced daily, this becomes your body's anchor. Controlled breathing flips a metabolic switch. Your parasympathetic nervous system activates while sympathetic overdrive quiets. Blood flow sharpens your prefrontal cortex (decision zone). Anxiety dissolves before your to-do list even lands. Cortisol (stress hormone) plummets within minutes of slow, deliberate breathing. Studies show even acute sessions decrease cortisol measurably. Do this daily and you're recalibrating your baseline stress threshold. Your body forgets to panic easily. Ten minutes of belly breathing lowers systolic and diastolic pressure sustainably. Heart rate stabilizes. This trains your cardiovascular system to respond less frantically to everyday triggers. Over weeks, resting numbers improve noticeably. Oxygenation improves. Your prefrontal cortex gets more nutrient-rich blood. Decision-making becomes clearer. That morning fog lifts. You enter the day cognisant, not foggy. Your first meeting doesn't feel chaotic already. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/6-benefits-of-doing-ten-minutes-of-controlled-breathing-every-morning-for-a-month/slideshow/125587223.cms", "timestamp": 1764160568.5189385}

Brat made these claims on a talk show hosted by conservative political strategist Steve Bannon on X called Bannon's WarRoom. Brat, in the talk show, claimed the 'Madras district' got more than double the permitted H1B limit per year for the entire world, saying that this amounts to 'industrial-scale fraud'. He also went on to claim that India gets 71 per cent of all H1B visas while China accounts for only 12 per cent of the same. Brat then warns that such entries take away the jobs and the ability to own homes from American citizens. \"When I say H-1B visa, you need to think of your cousins, your aunts and uncles, and your grandparents. One of these folks comes over and claims they're skilled; they're not. That's the fraud. They just took away your family's job, and your mortgage, and your house, and all that,\" he said. As per several reports, Chennai did process around 220,000 visas in 2024. The US Consulate in Chennai is one of the busiest in the world when it comes to the processing of H1B visas, since it serves the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, as well as Telangana. The figure of 220,000 has not been independently verified by Mint . This is not the first time such claims have been made. Earlier, Mahvash Siddiqui, an Indian-American diplomat, had also raised a similar issue, calling the H1B visa applications in India an 'industrial scale' fraud. Siddiqui, having served at the Chennai consulate from 2005 to 2007, said that most of the H1B visas that Indians get a fraudulent, since they produce fake letters of employment, forged degrees, as well as proxy interviews.

This is a “first-of-its-kind” initiative by the central government to promote REPM ecosystem, “enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPM market ”, the government said in a statement. Mint was the first to report that the finance ministry’s expenditure finance committee (EFC) had approved the ₹ 7,300 crore production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme, setting the stage for cabinet clearance. Minister of information and broadcasting Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters on Wednesday that the REPM scheme was drawn along the lines of India's semiconductor mission. He said incentives under this scheme would allow India to become self-reliant in rare earth magnet manufacturing in the next three to four years. \"This is a very important strategic decision. It will create a completely integrated manufacturing ecosystem.\" India's annual demand for these magnets is about 4,000-5,000 tonnes, Vaishnaw said. Earth deposits, called 'placer deposits', are found along beaches, and India is among the top three countries for such deposits, he said. “India has 6.9 million tonnes of rare earth deposits.” The scheme will follow a “whole-of-government” approach, working alongside the semiconductor mission and the national critical minerals mission to build a resilient supply chain. Both public and private sector companies will be eligible to participate. Companies from electronics, automobiles, and steel have shown interest in participating in this scheme. “The companies which will receive incentives will be decided transparently. And they will decide where they would set up manufacturing plants,” he said. “This is a strategic sector. We have to be present in it.

The drone-formed tiger also won a Guinness World Record for being the largest mammal portrait ever created by a synchronised drone swarm. This year's display utilised double the number of drones deployed in the show held in 2024. The previous record for the largest aerial image of a mammal formed by drones stood at 1,985 drones.  Alongside the roaring tiger, the drone fleet also formed images of a soldier, an elephant, a peacock, and various other cultural emblems of India.  The spectacular event was organised by the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation (CESC) Mysore to mark the celebrated Mysuru Dasara 2025 festival on 29 September 2025. The show itself was orchestrated by Botlab Dynamics. CESC Managing Director Munigopal Raju disclosed that this year's aerial show was intentionally ramped up, according to a report by The Hindu. “We decided to increase the number of drones from 1,500 used last year to 3,000 for 2025,” he said. Raju added that the team realised they had an opportunity to set a Guinness record while planning the formation, as nobody had yet presented a tiger using such a massive fleet of drones.

Notably, the American military has increased activity in the Caribbean and the Pacific based on claims that it is fighting drugs flowing into the US from South America. In an interview with CNN, Petro accused the US of imperialistic behaviour, adding that he believes the actions against Venezuela are in pursuit of the country's oil reserves, believed to be the largest in the world. The report said that the US Department of State and the White House have been reached for comment. Speaking to CNN , Petro said that Venezuela is not considered a major drug producer and a relatively small part of the global drugs trade flows through the country. “(Oil) is at the heart of the matter. So, that’s a negotiation about oil. I believe that is (US President Donald) Trump’s logic. He’s not thinking about the democratisation of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking,” he told CNN . On 25 November, Petro also accused the US of imperialistic actions, alleging that it is trying to “impose its will on neighbours”, adding, “The United States cannot be considered an empire, but one of the nations among others.” Regarding his message to the American people, the South American leader stated that he wants to convey the same message given to members of the US special forces: “Your function, as they say in the oaths, is to fight against oppression.” Petro recalled his speech at the end of the UN General Assembly in September, where he called on American soldiers to disobey Trump and “not to point their rifles at humanity”, telling CNN that the move cost him — his visa was revoked.

The clarification came after strong protests — particularly from political parties in Punjab — over entries in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha bulletins indicating that the Centre planned to introduce the Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, 2025, during the session starting 1 December. Currently, Chandigarh is a Union Territory (UT) and shares its capital with the states of Punjab and Haryana. The Governor of Punjab holds an additional charge as the Administrator of Chandigarh. By bringing Chandigarh under the ambit of Article 240 of the Constitution, the government has learnt to pave the way for the city to get an independent administrator, like the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) in many other UTs. Political parties in Punjab, including the Aam Aadmi Party , the Congress, and the SAD, viewed the proposal as clearing the way for the appointment of an independent Administrator or Lieutenant Governor (L-G). Since 1984, the Governor of Punjab has been the Administrator of Chandigarh .

Earlier, he fell sick on 23 November, the day Smriti Mandhana and Palash Muchhal were supposed to get married. The senior Mandhana was admitted to a hospital in Sangli, Smriti’s hometown. According to Doctors, his condition is stable now and he is no longer in danger. The medical team carried out an angiography and found no blockages, the publication added. Since it was a sudden hospitalisation for Smriti’s father, the wedding was indefinitely postponed. Now that he’s back, there is still radio silence. None of the families has shared any update on a new wedding date. Meanwhile, rumours have surfaced online about Palash Muchhal allegedly cheating on Smriti Mandhana.

What led to the woman's \"harassment\" at the Shanghai airport stems from a diplomatic issue between India and China, and Beijing's aggressive territorial claims. What's the controversy around the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh? Why is there a border dispute between India and China over Arunachal Pradesh? Here's all you need to know. China considers the entire Arunachal Pradesh its territory, calling it \"Zangnan\" or Southern Tibet - a claim India firmly rejects. Back in 2023, Beijing released a so-called standard map, depicting Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin as Chinese territories, in an attempt to assert its claim over the Indian state. China has also renamed certain places in Arunachal Pradesh at least four times — in 2017, 2021, 2023, and 2024. But India has outrightly rejected China's claim and maintained that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of the country. In 2024, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar had quipped, “If today, I change the name of your house, will it become mine? Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always be a state of India. Changing names does not have an effect...Our army is deployed there (Line of Actual Control)...” Arunachal Pradesh has been a flashpoint between India and China for decades. While the historical backdrop of the dispute dates to the 1962 Sino-Indian War — where China launched a military offensive and occupied parts of Arunachal Pradesh — the current conflict began in 2007.

The National Turkey Federation confirmed that both birds would 'live out their days' under expert care at the institution.", "content": "US President Donald Trump granted clemency to two massive white-feathered turkeys—Gobble and Waddle—on Tuesday, continuing one of the White House’s most lighthearted holiday traditions. Both birds, each weighing more than 50 pounds (23 kg), were raised on a farm in North Carolina and were treated to a night at the upscale Willard InterContinental Hotel ahead of their appearance. Despite the festive atmosphere, Trump used the annual event to deliver a series of political jabs while adding to the more than 1,600 pardons he has issued during his current term. The ceremonial pardon traces its roots to 1989, when President George HW Bush formally established the Thanksgiving ritual. Trump upheld that legacy while adding his own brand of humour, remarking that he had initially wanted to rename the turkeys Chuck and Nancy—a nod to Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. “But then I realised I wouldn't be pardoning them,” he quipped, adding, “I would never pardon those two people.” The president also took a swipe at his predecessor, claiming without evidence that former President Joe Biden’s pardons for Peach and Blossom were invalid because Biden allegedly “used an automated signing device.” Trump accordingly “re-pardoned” both birds. Following tradition, Gobble and Waddle will retire to North Carolina State University’s agriculture college. The National Turkey Federation confirmed that both birds would \"live out their days\" under expert care at the institution. While the formal ceremony began in the late 20th century, anecdotes trace the earliest presidential reprieve back to 1863. Historians note that President Abraham Lincoln is believed to have spared a turkey after his young son became attached to the bird.

Tami Erwin, who spent over 30 years at Verizon before departing in 2022, posted the open letter on LinkedIn, which quickly went viral. “The news this week has weighed on me deeply. As I reflect on it tonight, on a quiet Friday night, I’m thinking about the people behind the headlines,” she wrote. Erwin, who rose from the position of a customer service representative to CEO of Verizon Business, stressed that even as technology reshapes everything, “people remain the heart of every company.” She urged laid-off staff to give themselves time to grieve. “To those impacted, from someone who will always bleed Verizon red: Give yourself permission to grieve. A job is identity, relationships, pride. Losing it is personal.” Verizon layoffs will significantly shrink its non-union workforce, which numbers around 100,000 employees in the United States. Verizon said that the job cuts were not directly tied to its pivot to artificial intelligence, according to Reuters . However, Erwin offered her own perspective on transformation, acknowledging that technology is rapidly reshaping everything: “Yes, AGI, quantum computing, robotics, and intelligent networks will redefine how we live, work, and play. The direction is right.” She also cautioned leaders to remember that people matter just as much as tech. “Technology doesn’t transform a company. People do. And when change affects people’s livelihoods, leaders must modernize more than systems — they must modernize process, communication, empathy, and accountability.” She said, “Transformation without humanity isn’t leadership.” Now serving as a board director and advisor to Silicon Valley startups, Erin drew on her own experience leaving Verizon three years ago, saying, “I can tell ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/verizons-ex-ceo-pens-open-letter-to-staff-hit-by-the-companys-biggest-layoff-says-your-story-isn-t-ending-11764139306267.html", "timestamp": 1764160576.6364267}

The court, however, refused to stay the ongoing trial proceedings in the CBI case.

The plea, submitted by Rabri Devi before the Principal District and Sessions Judge submitted, “The applicant (Devi) is having a bonafide and reasonable apprehension that fair and impartial justice will not be rendered by the Special Judge and that the conduct of the Special Judge during the proceedings in all cases appears to be unduly inclined towards the prosecution and bias which can be seen from number of instances of the case proceedinds/order”. The plea claimed there was “a reasonable apprehension of bias” and that in the interest of justice, the cases needed to be transferred to another court of competent jurisdiction.

However, an Indian techie living in Sweden, says that he will be returning to Delhi on 5 December and doesn't “care” about the AQI — which remains very poor — as he needs some “real oxygen now of friends and family.” The techie, Ankur Tyagi, has shared the hidden struggles of living away from family. He added that the “ AQI here is 10”, but isolation and loneliness cannot be overlooked. Tyagi, who has been residing in the European nation for the past five years, expressed his views on the social media platform X. His post has garnered thousands of views and resonated with many. “I have lived in the EU now for the past five years, and people think it is all clean air, good roads and perfect social systems. Nobody really knows what it takes to build a life here,” Tyagi wrote in the post. “You do everything alone. You cook, clean, manage bills, raise your kid and fight the silence that hits you every single winter. “Friends are polite but distant. Community is rare. Back home you fight corruption and chaos but at least you have people around you. “In the West problems are different and they cut deeper in ways you can't explain unless you've lived it (sic).” “Every place has a cost. Most of us are just learning which costs we can survive. Coming to Delhi on 5th Dec f*** AQI, who cares, I live in 10 AQI for entire year i need some real oxygen now of friends and family...see you soon India,” he concluded. “All places have their pros and cons. It depends on us which pros we settle with,” said one user in the comment section. “You are always one step away when you all just need your people; all other things are manageable,” another added. “I stayed in the US for a few months and realised it’s not for me.

The agency said investigations revealed that Soyab “had also provided logistical support to the terrorist Umar before the 10th November car bombing that killed several persons and injured many others outside the Red Fort in the national capital.” “The NIA had earlier arrested six other key aides of the car bomber Umar over the course of its investigation in the case,” the agency was quoted as saying. Soyab is the seventh accused linked to a 'white-collar' terror module busted by the Jammu and Kashmir Police. \"The agency continues to pursue various leads in connection with the suicide bombing, and has been conducting searches across states in coordination with the respective police forces in a bid to identify and track others involved in the gruesome attack,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, as per PTI . Earlier, one Amir Rashid Ali was arrested for allegedly arranging a safe house and providing logistical support to Dr Umar Nabi. Ali is believed to be the last person to have been in contact with Nabi. On the evening of Monday, 10 November, a high-intensity blast ripped through an explosive-laden car near Delhi's Red Fort metro station, killing several people. The blast came hours after eight people, including three doctors connected to the Al Falah University, were arrested, and 2,900 kilograms of explosives were seized. Authorities said the discovery exposed a \"white-collar terror module\" involving Jaish-e-Mohammed and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind, spanning Kashmir, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

According to the RCF police station official, a video has surfaced on social media showing the Kali Mata idol dressed as Mother Mary in the temple in suburban Chembur. Devotees visiting the temple on Sunday were taken aback to find the idol of Goddess Kali dressed in attire resembling that of the mother of Jesus Christ. They contacted the local police and told them about the change in the deity's attire. When quizzed by devotees, a temple priest, identified only as Ramesh, claimed the Hindu Goddess appeared in his dream and instructed him to \"adorn her in the form of Mother Mary\". A case was registered under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita against the priest for hurting the religious feelings of a community, according to police. The priest was subsequently arrested and produced before a local court, which remanded him to two days of police custody, they said. Cops were now ascertaining if there was any organised motive behind the incident or whether more persons were involved in it, the official added. Earlier in September, a Durga Puja pandal in Ranchi with the theme of ‘Vatican City’ angered the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), which alleged that it has been done to \"hurt religious sentiments of Hindus\" and encourage conversion, charges that were rejected by the organisers. Vatican City in Europe is the world's smallest sovereign state and the centre of the Roman Catholic Church. VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal shared on X his reservation about a Durga Puja marquee on the theme of 'Vatican City'. \"This has been done with an objective to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus and aimed at encouraging religious conversion.

Let us move forward together on the path of progress with a resolve to build a stronger and more prosperous India.” Home Minister Shah stressed the central government's zero-tolerance policy against terrorism.

However, residents of Delhi and surrounding areas can take solace in the fact that the ash cloud from the Hayli Gubbi volcano in Ethiopia did not further affect the already dismal air quality, as had been initially feared.

The act has invited a strong reaction from the BJP and its ally, Shiv Sena , with at least two ministers from Maharashtra warning of action against the stand-up comedian on Tuesday. \"The police would take action against anyone who puts out such objectionable posts,\" Senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. In a social media post, Kamra was seen on Monday wearing a T-Shirt that arguably mocked the RSS. Shiv Sena cabinet minister Sanjay Shirsat, whose party is an ally of the BJP, insisted that the party must respond strongly to the comedian's controversial post, pointing out that Kamra had made vitriolic remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde in the past. \"Earlier, he targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Eknath Shinde, and now he has dared to directly attack the RSS. The BJP needs to respond to this,\" Shirsat said. \"We (Shiv Sena) responded to it (to Kamra's critical comments on Shinde earlier this year). Now, he has mustered the courage to make an objectionable post against the RSS,\" said the minister. Kamra is not new to controversies over his political jokes. In March, he courted controversy when he made critical comments against Maharashtra Deputy CM Eknath Shinde , who heads the Shiv Sena. The 36-year-old comedian had then taken a jibe at Shinde’s political career in his show by modifying the lyrics of a popular Hindi movie song. Angry over the remarks, Shiv Sena members later damaged the Habitat Comedy Club in Mumbai's Khar, as well as a hotel whose premises the club is located on, where Kamra’s show was taking place.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764160603.4276893}
