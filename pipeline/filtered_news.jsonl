IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764069248.7966878}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

The Language and Cognition Laboratory, established within the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, is claimed as the first lab in India dedicated to systematically exploring the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation. In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages. In the long term, it plans to integrate advanced neurocognitive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS).

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

Participating in international moot courts and research projects exposed me to diverse legal systems, and I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding global frameworks of justice and governance.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music.

For many, Chemistry is that middle ground, not as formula-heavy as Physics, not as vast as Biology. But here’s the catch: Chemistry rewards clarity, consistency, and calm. Treat it well, and it’ll be your most scoring ally. Neglect it, and it’ll throw a few surprises your way, especially in the NEET exam hall. So, What Makes Chemistry Special? Each has its own flavour.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew.

Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1764069319.620884}

It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services. Speaking at the launch, Education Minister Ashish Sood said the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India and Viksit Bharat 2047. The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said. The minister added that the app is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and will encourage skill-based learning while integrating activities under the Fit India initiative. Expressing gratitude to developers, teachers, and administrators involved in the project, Sood said, “When determination is strong, the results are equally powerful.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date. Immigration officials note that not all visa holders are expected to apply immediately for the additional five hours, as some may wait until their next visa renewal or may be nearing the end of their studies.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday — more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020 . It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery. Companies from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China.

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless ” and pocket-sized . Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io , to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco. Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes. “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said. The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted.

Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.” U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word “cameo,” as well as any similar-sounding words or phrases, on Sora.

Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission. “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding. The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation.

Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko , is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “ An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own .” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox , I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network.

As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark. Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users.

In a tweet on Sunday, Kupor said that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.” Amy Gleason, who was named as the “official” acting administrator of DOGE earlier this year, posted on LinkedIn soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.” While active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. DOGE’s cuts have also been blamed for countless deaths across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.

You can either create a playlist manually, or Pocket Casts can automatically create one for you. Playlists are designed to better personalize the listening experience for users as Pocket Casts seeks to grow its paid user base and compete with larger platforms. Currently, it has 60,000 subscribers, while Spotify has 281 million. The new feature makes it easy to curate collections based on specific topics and themes, or could be used to listen to your favorite podcast guest featured across different shows. It’s also helpful for preparing a list of episodes to enjoy while on a long flight or during your daily commute. To get started creating a manual playlist, navigate to the Playlists tab on the main screen and select the “+” icon on a mobile device or “New playlist” on the web version. From there, you can browse through your favorite podcasts and handpick the episodes that you want to include in your personalized playlist. For those who prefer a more automated approach, Pocket Casts offers Smart Playlists. By selecting the “Smart rules” button, you can create custom rules that automatically gather episodes based on specific criteria. For example, if you only want to listen to shorter episodes, you can set a rule to only include shows under 25 minutes, or filter by unplayed or downloaded content. This feature is especially useful if you have a busy schedule and want to make the most of your free time. Currently, the Playlist feature is available on the web version and desktop apps, with a rollout for Android users already underway. The feature is arriving on iOS devices soon. The update follows Pocket Casts’ decision to make its web player free for users, further positioning itself as a strong competitor in the podcasting space against major platforms that ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/pocket-casts-now-lets-you-create-a-playlist-of-your-favorite-podcast-episodes/", "timestamp": 1764069602.3888288}

Humane Bench evaluates models based on core principles of human flourishing, prioritizing well-being, and respecting user attention.", "content": "AI chatbots have been linked to serious mental health harms in heavy users, but there have been few standards for measuring whether they safeguard human well-being or just maximize for engagement. A new benchmark dubbed HumaneBench seeks to fill that gap by evaluating whether chatbots prioritize user well-being and how easily those protections fail under pressure. “I think we’re in an amplification of the addiction cycle that we saw hardcore with social media and our smartphones and screens,” Erika Anderson, founder of Building Humane Technology, which produced the benchmark, told TechCrunch. “But as we go into that AI landscape, it’s going to be very hard to resist. And addiction is amazing business. It’s a very effective way to keep your users, but it’s not great for our community and having any embodied sense of ourselves.” Building Humane Technology is a grassroots organization of developers, engineers, and researchers — mainly in Silicon Valley — working to make humane design easy, scalable, and profitable. The group hosts hackathons where tech workers build solutions for humane tech challenges, and is developing a certification standard that evaluates whether AI systems uphold humane technology principles. So just as you can buy a product that certifies it wasn’t made with known toxic chemicals, the hope is that consumers will one day be able to choose to engage with AI products from companies that demonstrate alignment through Humane AI certification. Most AI benchmarks measure intelligence and instruction-following, rather than psychological safety. HumaneBench joins exceptions like DarkBench.ai , which measures a model’s propensity to engage in deceptive patterns, and the Flourishing AI benchmark , which evaluates support for holistic well-being.

The feature, which allows users to post under a custom username instead of their real name, provides an alternative to posting anonymously. With anonymous posting, users can share without the post being connected to their Facebook profile and real-life identity, but this approach also doesn’t allow other group members to get to know them or their personality, or to follow their updates over time. Meta says that nicknames will allow people to participate in groups more personally while maintaining privacy, particularly in groups where users want privacy but still want to build a recognizable presence. It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s long-standing “real name” policy, which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life. That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections. After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature. This allows users to hide their main profile and profile photo from other members but not from group admins, moderators, or Facebook’s own systems. However, others in the group will be able to view a user’s complete post history under their nickname in that group, as well as the comments and reactions made in the group over the last seven days. Facebook will suggest nicknames to users, but users can change this nickname to one of their choosing.

Across large platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, users are watching billions of videos every day, with companies benefiting massively from this content explosion. For creators, this often means there is pressure to create more content than ever before to be relevant and make a living out of it, especially as more AI-generated slop is infiltrating these platforms. Jay Neo, a creator and former content lead for short videos at MrBeast, thinks AI can help creators understand what is working for them and also help them create new content ideas in that direction. That’s why, along with former Palantir engineer Shivam Kumar and creator Harry Jones, they are building a platform called Palo to aid creators. Neo joined MrBeast at 18 to work on viewer retention. In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped. “I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said. Neo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to get a baguette , which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format. In 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month. With these experiences, Neo understood there’s power in content formulation and analytics. During his time building Creaky, the team had multiple spreadsheets tracking different metrics around videos. At that time, one of Neo’s advisors suggested that he turn these insights into a product for creators, and he started working with Palo’s other co-founders in early 2024.

SitusAMC, which provides technology for over a thousand commercial and real estate financiers, confirmed in a statement over the weekend that it had identified a data breach on November 12. The company said that unspecified hackers had stolen corporate data associated with its banking customers’ relationship with SitusAMC, as well as “accounting records and legal agreements” during the cyberattack. The statement added that the scope and nature of the cyberattack “remains under investigation.” SitusAMC said that the incident is “now contained,” and that its systems are operational. The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company’s systems rather than causing destruction. According to Bloomberg and CNN , citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website. It’s unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers. According to SitusAMC’s website, the company processes billions of documents related to loans annually. When reached by TechCrunch, Citi spokesperson Patricia Tuma declined to comment on the breach.

The country’s communications minister, Fahmi Fadzil, reportedly said the administration is considering systems for implementing age restrictions on social media platforms, barring users under 16 years old from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and X, Reuters reported . “We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” the report quoted Fadzil as saying. Malaysia would join a growing list of countries that are implementing age restrictions or verification measures to protect children from the risks associated with social media usage . Australia has already passed a law that will come into force on December 10, mandating social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16. France, Denmark, Italy, and Norway are working on similar age-restriction measures for social media platforms, and in the U.S., 24 states have so far enacted age-verification laws. Utah became the first U.S. state to require app stores to verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for minors downloading apps. The U.K.’s Online Safety Act also came into effect in July, mandating social media and other online platforms to block children’s access to harmful content or face huge fines. The U.K. requires strong age checks for high-risk content, like self-harm and eating-disorder content, to protect users under 18.

It’s the dull but critical work that keeps software running the way it should, and as developers look to automate more of their workloads, it’s increasingly being done by AI. On Monday, the AI testing startup Momentic said it had raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures. Existing investors at Y Combinator, FCVC, Transpose Platform, and Karman Ventures also participated in the round. The new funding builds on a $3.7 million seed round, which the company announced in March . Momentic makes tools for software testing and verification, a niche currently occupied by open source frameworks like Playwright and Selenium. Those tools offer complex, fine-grained controls, but Momentic is counting on AI to make the process simple and effective. “We help our customers make sure their product works,” co-founder Wei-Wei Wu said. “They can describe their critical user flows in plain English and our AI will automate it.” Wu and his co-founder Jeff An both have backgrounds in developer tooling at companies like Qualtrics and WeWork. (Wu is particularly proud of his contributions to the open source Node.js.) The biggest constant for all those companies, as Wu saw it, was the problem of verifying code. “Testing has been the biggest pain point for every team I’ve ever worked with,” Wu told TechCrunch. Momentic’s AI-driven approach has already won over a number of clients. The company currently boasts 2,600 users across its customer base, which includes companies like Notion, Xero, Bilt, Webflow, and Retool.

In November 2023, he was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy by a jury in the Southern District of New York over his role in the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Immediately after his sentencing, Bankman-Fried signaled his intention to appeal . In spring, he spoke to a handful of reporters from prison. But otherwise, he has largely receded from public view.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool. From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works.

Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability. The sensors have been recessed further into the body of the ring itself, which reduces the overall thickness considerably and allows for a wider available range of ring sizes.

The older Oura 3 could run for around three days before it needed a charge, Our reviewer, Adrienne So, reported that the Ring 4 tracked a full weekend of hiking and physical activity, as well as a music festival, and still had enough juice for at least a couple more days.

If you want to also keep track of your food intake, a new Meals feature lets you take photos of what you eat and then track its effects on your body. Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes.

Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly due to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs in terms of connectivity or resolution.

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet cofounded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him. Nnormal Backcountry Nnormal Nnormal's aim is to institute sustainable practices into manufacturing gear. “Probably the most important system is the most complicated,” Jornet said. “It's very costly to be constantly rotating things … how can we have [a company] that's not based on overconsumption?” The solution was to create incredibly durable running shoes that only have to be swapped out every two to four years.

Most home arcade machines are at least as expensive as the latest game consoles, sometimes far more expensive. They usually come with several games included, but they are still a considerable investment, so think carefully before you buy. Don’t get hung up on how many titles are included. It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal.

Apple Best Buy Amazon Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

According to the Financial Times, the first review of possible amendments could take place toward the end of 2026 as part of a broader Digital Omnibus package, which aims to simplify guidelines. At a daily press briefing on November 7, Thomas Regnier, the spokesman for the European Commission for Digital Sovereignty, acknowledged mounting concerns. “A lot is happening in the field of artificial intelligence. Standards are lagging. There are concerns from industry and member states,\" he said. “In this context, we have a ‘digital omnibus’ coming, and that would be the appropriate framework to address some of these concerns. But no decision has been made yet.” The most significant change would involve postponing by one year—from August 2026 to August 2027—the application of penalties for violations of the new rules in order to “grant sufficient time for providers and users of AI systems to comply.” The Digital Networks Act had been promised by the end of t", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/europe-bends-us-digital-policies-eu-ai-act/", "timestamp": 1764069608.4163802}

The best MagSafe wallets let you attach a sleek, compact, and slim wallet to your iPhone (or MagSafe-compatible case ) instead of carrying a bulky traditional wallet.

However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets. If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone.

ChromeOS still doesn’t compete with Windows and Macs for heavy-duty stuff like gaming and video editing, but it isn’t trying to.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war. Aaron Roth suspects that the pitfalls of algorithmic pricing may not have a simple sol", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/game-theory-explains-how-algorithms-can-drive-up-prices/", "timestamp": 1764069609.799315}

But what if you want to bring the full excitement of the movies home? How can you ensure you’re getting an audio performance that will do justice to the pictures you’re watching? By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need. Below you'll find everything you need to know about getting started with surround sound, and the kind of setup you will need in order to achieve it. Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup. You may have seen surround sound setups described numerically—most commonly as 5.1-channel or 7.1-channel surround sound systems, but so", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-perfect-surround-sound-speaker-setup/", "timestamp": 1764069609.9802308}

If you knew an intercontinental ballistic missile was heading somewhere in middle America, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead, you'd probably hope that the US government and military would be on top of the situation. At the very least, you'd expect them to know who launched the strike, from where, and how to intercept it. In A House of Dynamite , the most terrifying thing is how much might not be known in such a nightmarish scenario, and how the very systems we think will protect us from nuclear war might not be up to the job. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow ( The Hurt Locker ) and featuring a powerhouse cast including Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts, and Anthony Ramos, this triptych explores the same nightmarish 18 minutes after an unidentified missile is detected from three different perspectives, each chapter likely filling you with mounting existential dread. The film that pissed off the Pentagon , this political thriller is absolutely not for the faint-hearted. When workaholic game developer Tim (Matthias Schweighöfer, Army of the Dead ) and his partner Liv (Ruby O. Fee) break up, Liv finds it hard to walk away. Quite literally, as their apartment block has been mysteriously surrounded by an impenetrable barrier.

I love him anyway.", "content": "This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. I’ve been a vegetarian for over a decade. It’s not because of my health, or because I dislike the taste of chicken or beef: It’s a lifestyle choice I made because I wanted to reduce my impact on the planet. And yet, twice a day, every day, I lovingly scoop a cup of meat-based kibble into a bowl and set it down for my 50-pound rescue dog, a husky mix named Loki. Until recently, I hadn’t devoted a huge amount of thought to that paradox. Then I read an article in the Associated Press headlined “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The study , led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.” The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions. But mere hours after the AP published its article, its aim had been recast as something else entirely: an attack on people’s furry family members. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one Reddit user wrote. Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals. Goldwert and her fellow researchers watched the reactions unfold with dismay. “If I saw a headline that said, ‘Climate scientists want to take your dogs away,’ I would also fee", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-climate-paradox-of-having-a-dog/", "timestamp": 1764069612.3119822}

Set in late 1800s Japan, Last Samurai Standing follows retired samurai Shujiro Saga (Junichi Okada), who enters the savage \"Kodoku\" tournament in a desperate effort to save his family, struck down by cholera. The problem is, he's one of 292 former samurai aiming to win the ¥100,000 prize, and the only way to progress through the competition is to collect tags from fallen enemies and pass through checkpoints set up by the event's mysterious organizers. It's going to be a bloodbath. Based on the series of Japanese novels written by Shogo Imamura and illustrated by Katsumi Tatsuzawa, this packs in some of the finest sword duels and martial arts sequences ever committed to the screen, all while exploring the rapidly changing face of Japanese society after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Think Squid Game set in Meiji era Japan, and you're scratching the surface of this thrilling six-episode miniseries.

The issue stems from WhatsApp’s discovery feature, which allows someone to enter a person’s phone number to see if they’re on the app. By doing this billions of times—which WhatsApp did not prevent—researchers from the University of Vienna uncovered what they’re calling “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever . Vaping is a major problem in US high schools. But is the solution to spy on students in the bathroom? An investigation by The 74, copublished with WIRED, found that schools around the country are turning to vape detectors in an effort to crack down on nicotine and cannabis consumption on school grounds. Some of the vape detectors go far beyond detecting vapor by including microphones that are surprisingly accurate and revealing. While few defend addiction and drug use, even non-vapers say the added surveillance and the punishments that result go too far. Don’t look now, but that old networking equipment your company hasn’t thought about in years may jump out and bite you. Tech giant Cisco this week launched a new initiative, warning companies that AI tools are making it increasingly simple for attackers to find vulnerabilities in outdated and unpatched networking infrastructure. The message: Upgrade or else. If you’ve ever attended a conference, you probably worried about getting sick in the cesspools that are a conference center. But one hacker conference in New Zealand, Kawaiicon, invented a novel way to keep attendees a little bit safer. By tracking the CO 2 levels in each conference room, Kawaiicon’s organizers were able to create a real-time air-quality monitoring system , which would tell people which rooms were safe and which seemed … gross.

The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) says the latest release supports all kinds of cameras, so we’re talking indoor security cameras , outdoor security cameras , video doorbells , baby monitors , and pet cameras . This could vastly improve a seriously fractured landscape, enabling you to easily add and access your cameras on whatever platform you choose. It’s also something that can potentially be delivered in a software update, so some of the cameras you already own might get Matter support. All the top gear news of the week in one place . Here's more you may have missed this week: You may be worrying about limitations, but the supported feature list is impressive, including video and audio streaming, two-way communication, local and remote access, multiple streams, pan-tilt-zoom controls, and both detection and privacy zones. There’s also support for continuous or event-based recording, either locally or to the cloud. What it won’t handle is how that storage is managed, meaning some camera manufacturers will still require you to use their cloud-based subscription models. Pleasingly, there are no limitations on resolution, unlike Apple HomeKit Secure Video , or restrictions on AI detection features. Matter is using WebRTC technology, with remote access handled via the STUN and TURN protocols, meaning that manufacturers can choose to implement end-to-end encryption for footage. TCP transport support is designed to allow more efficient and reliable transmission of lots of data, like video cameras produce, which should reduce the load on your Wi-Fi and the impact on camera battery life.

Designed to sit under your TV as comfortably as it would under a monitor, these are micro PCs —but only because Valve seems shy of branding them consoles . The new Steam Machines are Valve's second attempt at launching a dedicated device to bring the PC into the living room. The first generation Steam Machines launched a decade ago, in November 2015, and while that iteration ultimately flopped , the marketplace in 2025 is much different. The Steam Deck has been a huge success, inspiring a whole fleet of gaming handhelds —with even Xbox joining the party —and PC gaming as a whole is in a much stronger position. So, when the announcement video for this new product family went to great lengths to explain that the new Steam Machine is still a PC and not a console, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. Valve makes and sells PC games; here's a PC to play those games on. Except … c'mon, look at it: In every way that counts, the new Steam Machine effectively is a console—and that's no bad thing. Pop quiz: What defines a games console? Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big-screen television. The benefits include fixed specifications, meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers know that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course). Roughly every half-decade, they might buy a new-generation model. What then defines a PC, gaming or otherwise? Almost the opposite—a typically desk-bound rig, built from whatever parts the user fancies, and when they need a bit more power, they can swap", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/valve-says-steam-machine-isnt-a-console-but-it-is/", "timestamp": 1764069613.5897057}

He records from his phone. Just in front of him, a player in a red suit demands to see a warrant for his client. The “special event” held on November 20, where players took on different roles that reflect real-life ICE raids, was the first initiative by New Save Collective , a baker’s dozen of gamers with backgrounds in activism and organizing, whose goal is to educate gamers and teach people about their rights when dealing with ICE in real-world situations.

After 11 days, the company began contacting those who made purchases, calling it a “clear mistake.”", "content": "On November 8, an offer for loyalty card holders appeared on the website of MediaWorld, a European electronics retailer. The deal: an iPad Air for 15 euros (about $17) instead of the usual €879 (about $1,012). No catch, no strings attached. The proximity to Black Friday only made the offer more plausible. And so several consumers immediately purchased the product by choosing the “payment and pickup in store” opetion, on paper the safest to avoid unexpected problems. The process was seamless, even for those ordering online. According to the accounts of some users on Reddit, their order was accepted, and after about 40 minutes they received an email confirming the availability of the product. In the store, the €15 payment went through successfully and MediaWorld delivered the iPads as expected. The terms and conditions attached to the order make no mention of any clause regarding pricing errors or the possibility for the company to request subsequent additions. Eleven days later, however, MediaWorld sent a simple email—not a formal communication via certified mail—stating that the published price was “clearly incorrect.” The company then asked affected customers to choose between two solutions: Keep the iPad and pay the difference to match the price, but with a €150 discount, or return it and receive a refund of the €15 and a €20 discount voucher for their inconvenience. Following the incident, WIRED contacted MediaWorld for comment. “We confirm that, in a very short period of time, due to a clearly recognizable technical error caused by an extraordinary and unexpected glitch on our ecommerce platform, some products were mistakenly displayed at prices that, due to their clear and objective disconnect from the true market value and the correct promotional price, should never have been displayed.

Yet we weren't a sovereign republic yet. We needed rules, a framework, a governing skeleton. On November 26, 1949, India's Constituent Assembly adopted its Constitution after nearly three years of intricate drafting. Today, this historic document—and the visionary leadership of Ambedkar's committee—remains the bedrock of the world's largest democracy, uniting a bewilderingly diverse nation under one legal framework. In 1946, India elected 389 members to draft its Constitution. This Assembly wasn't a foreign import; it was elected by Indian representatives to reflect India's will. Dr. Rajendra Prasad chaired; the real intellectual firepower lay elsewhere, waiting to be unleashed. The Assembly appointed a seven-member Drafting Committee. Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar became Chairman. Other stalwarts: Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, K.M. Munshi, N. Gopalaswami, Muhammed Saadulla, and two others who'd later be replaced due to illness and death—testament to the grueling work ahead. For seven months, Ambedkar's committee labored. On February 21, 1948, they unveiled the first draft: 395 articles, 8 schedules, 22 parts. It wasn't perfect; it was scrutinized, torn apart, rebuilt. The drafting phase itself took 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days—a grueling odyssey by any standard. From November 14 to 26, the Assembly conducted three exhaustive readings of the final draft. Members debated provisions on caste, religion, language, federalism. Ambedkar steered every argument, defending the Constitution's progressive bones against both conservative and radical critiques relentlessly. At last, 284 members signed the adopted Constitution. The Assembly declared it complete. Yet implementation wasn't immediate. A deliberate gap existed, charged with symbolic weight. Ram Manohar Sinha and Nand Lal Bose of Shantiniketan illuminated the original Constitution by hand. It cost 64 lakh rupees (adjusted for inflation).

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier). We revise the rating to REDUCE (from SELL earlier) as the stock has reduced >7% over last month and we see limited downside from hereon.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: Apparel retailers are banking on a stronger winter season as an on-time, sharper dip in temperatures revives demand for sweaters and jackets after last year’s unusually warm spell left them with excess stock and heavy discounting. This year’s early chill, linked to the onset of La Niña, which typically brings below-normal temperatures across much of India, has pushed consumers to buy winter wear sooner than usual. A longer wedding season is further boosting footfalls, giving retailers a positive start to the upcoming third quarter. Industry estimates suggest that winter sales typically account for about 20% of the total annual sales for apparel companies. “The early indications of winter and the start of the wedding season have clearly lifted early-season sales,\" said Santosh Sreedhar, partner at Avalon Consulting. “This will be an important period to clear last year’s inventory and start next year with fresher styles.\" Poonam Upadhyay, director at Crisil Ratings, added that the overlap in winter and weddings amplifies demand. “Winter matters just as much because it coincides with the wedding season, when demand naturally surges.\" The winter wear market was valued at $12.73 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $22.64 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 6.16%, according to the India Thermal & Winter Wear report by IMARC Research. Last year’s mild winter was clearly reflected in the sector’s figures, reducing volumes, margins, and sell-through rates. Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI), said discounting was “deep,\" starting from 30-35% and rising to 50-60% in many cases, adding that volume growth was flat, with a decline in the value of goods sold.

In the screen recording, Sapra searches for his restaurant on the Zomato app, where it appears as unavailable. He then checks several other restaurants in the same neighbourhood, all of which show up as active and taking orders. Posting the clip on X, he said, “Here’s video proof of how rider allocation is being manipulated at Zomato,” and added that “Our restaurant is repeatedly shown as ‘unavailable’ at peak hours while nearby outlets within 50 meters keep getting riders.” He noted that he had been following up on this issue for 31 days without any progress. In another message, Sapra alleged that Zomato was intentionally marking his restaurant unavailable to push him to accept higher commission rates. He wrote, “It's all a game of increase our commission, from the current 52+% that they take on sales, to let's say a whopping 99% of each sale. The greed is not ending, and Goyal Babu is unable to control the loose canons in his team who are rigging the system,” naming Deepinder Goyal, CEO of Zomato’s parent company, Eternal. Aditya Mangla, CEO of Food Delivery at Zomato, replied to Sapra’s post, assuring him that the company would investigate. “Thank you for sharing this. I’m getting this checked,” he wrote. Responding to Mangla, the restaurateur said, “Thank you Aditya ji, means a lot you reached out. I have written to all your team members and have several meetings, yesterday was 31st Day, and no one seems to see a resolve.” Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

The candid behind-the-scenes footage, shared on Instagram, showed her clad in a grey T-shirt, jeans and suede boots — part of her campaign for the Women project. Rather than focusing on the project’s message or her long-standing advocacy around healthy living, social media commentary swiftly pivoted to a different theory: many users speculated that Michelle Obama has used the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic . Despite the mounting chatter, there is no evidence supporting these claims. Speculation exploded across Instagram and X, with users posting comments such as: “Ozempic - just like everyone on The View who suddenly decided to “get healthy”. I’m not knocking it - but for Christ’s sake- be honest about it!”  “It’s called Ozempic,\" another user wrote. “IS MICHELLE ON OZEMPIC? Michelle Obama sparks Ozempic weight loss rumors after flaunting slender frame in new photoshoot,” the third user asked. “Personal trainer and strict diet? Nah — Ozempic is way easier,” the fourth user wrote. These remarks reflect a growing trend where rapid transformations in public figures trigger assumptions about weight-loss medications. Ozempic contains the active ingredient semaglutide and is approved primarily to treat type-2 diabetes in adults, helping regulate blood sugar and reduce cardiovascular risk. While weight loss may be a secondary effect, Ozempic is not formally approved for cosmetic use or as a standalone slimming treatment.  Celebrities whose physiques shift noticeably often become easy targets for speculation. In Michelle Obama’s case, the visuals sparked speculation that her transformation may not just be fitness or diet-driven. The conversation demonstrates how quickly personal change can turn into public discussion — especially when it converges with trending topics such as GLP-1 drugs.

Ukraine’s air defenses worked to shield the capital from combined missile and drone attacks and loud explosions were heard, with authorities instructing residents to stay in shelters. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a residential apartment building had been severely damaged in the attacks and fire fighters were trying to extinguish blazes in several stores. Klitschko said some power and water supply cuts were being imposed in city districts as emergency workers responded to the attack, according to a statement on Telegram. Meantime, the Krasnodar region on Russia’s Black Sea coast suffered sustained suspected drone attacks overnight, injuring six people and damaging at least 20 residential buildings across five municipalities, Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said. The key port of Novorossiysk was among the hardest hit, he said.

The people residing in nearby premises have been evacuated. Based on initial findings, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South Zone) Kiran Khare Prabhakar told reporters that the blaze is suspected to have been triggered by a short circuit in the electronics showroom around 10 pm on Monday. However, the exact cause of the fire and the subsequent blast is being investigated, he said. A neighbouring shopkeeper said as fire started spreading around the building they heard a blast. Further investigation is on. (With agency inputs) Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news. Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment. Oops!

Karan is the younger son of industrialist and Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani, who serves as Director of Corporate Affairs at Reliance Industries and is known to be a close aide of Mukesh Ambani. While Mukesh Ambani was dressed in formal Indian attire, Nita Ambani opted for a heavily embellished saree for the occasion. The couple was seen greeting guests and posing for photographs at the venue. Anant Ambani also attended the ceremony and appeared in visuals shared online by MLA Shailesh Sotta. Nita Ambani looked radiant in a metallic grey silk saree featuring delicate floral embroidery. The saree was finished with a colourful patti border that added a vibrant touch to the classic drape. She styled it traditionally, letting the embellished pallu fall gracefully over her shoulder. She paired the saree with a contrasting deep indigo-blue blouse, crafted in silk with intricate work on the half sleeves. The fitted silhouette and U-shaped neckline elevated the overall look with modern elegance. For accessories, Nita Ambani opted for statement diamond and emerald jewellery from her personal collection — a layered necklace with striking emerald drops, matching cuffs, circular earrings and a standout ring. Keeping the focus on her ensemble, she tied her hair in a side-parted messy bun and rounded off the look with a red bindi, soft pink lips, glowing skin, defined brows, kohl-rimmed eyes and fluttery lashes — adding a touch of glamour to the festive occasion. A sweet video circulating on social media shows Nita Ambani blessing the newly married couple.

The video, posted by Instagram user Nomadic Teju, shows him in Greater Noida’s Gaur City explaining how his friend’s situation deteriorated after he resigned from his job hoping to find a better opportunity. He points out that flats in the area usually cost between ₹ 1 crore and ₹ 2 crore, while monthly rents can reach ₹ 30,000–35,000. According to him, the engineer had once lived in one of these apartments with his family. But the hiring slowdown left him without work, forcing him to rent out his own flat and move into a rented one instead. With EMIs still pending and no steady income, he is now relying on part-time Rapido rides and occasional freelance projects to get by. The clip has sparked a wider conversation online about the challenges facing tech workers amid AI-related disruptions and limited hiring. “This is just the beginning… A large number of people are already losing their jobs, and even more will lose them in the future,” one user commented. Another wrote, “Long story short - It's going to be more challenging in India… If anyone has chance to move abroad then don't think twice unless you have a good plan.” “Just gona get worse with more AI adoption,” a third user said, advising people to avoid major purchases. Another suggested, “People who are already in a housing loan should act now, sell at a high rate, sit on cash, and pay off the loan to be stress-free.” Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

Following the revision, Washington and Kyiv described the new draft as a “refined peace framework.” After the Geneva meeting, Zelensky said, “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points – no longer 28 – and many of the right elements have been taken into account in this framework. Our team has reported on the new draft of steps, and this is indeed the right approach – I will discuss the sensitive issues with President Trump.” The plan, reduced from 28 provisions to 19, has dropped one of the most contentious elements of Trump's peace proposal – a requirement that Ukraine surrender Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of the Donbas, to Russia, according to the New York Post . Ukraine has called the provision to cede the Luhansk and Donetsk territories to Russia unacceptable. Reports suggest US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, will meet at a later date to sort out the territorial issue. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has, meanwhile, asserted that although Trump wants to seal the deal quickly and has set a Thanksgiving Day deadline, no meeting is currently scheduled between the two leaders.

Zelensky has indicated that the updated plan now includes “correct” points – suggesting his government may be working to shape the proposal more favourably for Ukraine. The original 28-point peace proposal had caught many in the US government, Kyiv, and Europe off guard, raising concerns that the Trump administration might push Ukraine into a peace deal", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/trumps-ukraine-peace-plan-trimmed-to-19-points-to-drop-luhansk-donetsk-surrender-says-report-whats-in-it-11764036171848.html", "timestamp": 1764069667.259785}

According to the Early Warning System for Delhi, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) at 7am on Tuesday stood at 364. Most monitoring stations across the city recorded AQI levels above 300: Anand Vihar reported 401, ITO 379, Najafgarh 332, Narela 377, Punjabi Bagh 391, and Wazirpur 400. Pollution levels were similarly severe in neighbouring cities, with Noida at 419, Greater Noida at 340, and Gurugram at 351. A cloud of volcanic ash from the Hayli Gubbi eruption in Ethiopia has reached Delhi, blanketing parts of the city in a thin layer of haze. IMD director general M Mohapatra told HT that the volcanic plume is not expected to significantly affect Delhi’s pollution levels, as it is travelling at very high altitudes. On air quality, he said it is “unclear whether it will impact air quality, but any significant impact is unlikely as it is at higher levels.” He explained that the ash cloud is currently “nearing Gujarat” and is likely to begin influencing “Delhi-NCR and neighbouring northern India in the next few hours,” though its impact will mainly be felt in aviation. Since the plume is “in the upper-levels,” he noted that its effect near the surface will be limited. Residents may instead observe “a hazy, cloudy sky… its impact expected for a few hours, as it continues to move further eastwards.” Mohapatra added that some cities may experience “a marginal rise in the temperature” because the ash mass behaves like cloud cover.

At the third and final event at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, around 10,000 people, mostly foot soldiers of the Temple movement, are expected to attend, apart from high-profile guests including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath . PM Modi had performed 'Bhoomi Pujan' at Ram Mandir on 5 August 2020, and the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony was held on 22 January 2024. The right-angled triangular flag, measuring 10 feet in height and 20 feet in length, bears the image of a radiant Sun symbolising the brilliance and valour of Lord Rama, with an 'Om' inscribed on it along with the image of the Kovidara tree, a statement issued by the prime minister's office (PMO) said. The sacred saffron flag will convey a message of dignity, unity, and cultural continuity, embodying the ideals of Ram Rajya, the PMO said. The flag will rise atop a 'shikhar' constructed in the traditional north Indian Nagara architectural style, while the surrounding 800-metre Parkota, a circumambulatory enclosure built around the temple designed in the south Indian architectural tradition, will showcase the temple's diverse architecture, it said. During his stay in Ayodhya, the prime minister will visit the Saptamandir, which houses temples dedicated to Maharshi Vashishtha, Maharshi Vishwamitra, Maharshi Agastya, Maharshi Valmiki, Devi Ahilya, Nishadraj Guha, and Mata Shabari. This will be followed by a visit to the Sheshavtar Mandir. Modi will also visit the Mata Annapurna temple and perform ‘darshan’ and ‘pooja’ at the Ram Darbar Garbh Grah, which will be followed by ‘darshan’ at the Ram Lalla Garbh Grah, the statement said.

The doctor writes: “I go out, looking at people, so careless … breathing in the poison without realising what it’s doing to them… Being a doctor, and seeing young children playing and teenagers so happily roaming on the street like nothing’s wrong, it’s scary… Please start wearing N95 mask. Please do it. You are otherwise killing yourself with each breath you take… Remember Chernobyl? No one wanted to accept the reality because it was scary… We are living in a Chernobyl right now.” The urgency in the doctor’s tone reflects a truth that official data now backs up. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), as of 24 November 2025 the average Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi stood at 382, placing the city firmly in the “very poor” category. Multiple monitoring stations recorded readings above 400 — deemed “severe” — underscoring the magnitude of the public-health threat As the urgent plea gained traction online, several users responded by asking what preventive steps can be taken. One commenter wrote: “Any preventive health check-ups that can be done to assess the damage? X-ray or coloured MRIs?” The doctor clarified that pollution affects multiple organs over time and not just the lungs: “Air pollution affects your whole body, not just a single area. It’s good to get regular health check-ups. Only if you have any specific symptoms, you need to get more tests like MRI or X-ray. There’s no other need otherwise.” Another user asked, “I also have a question, i can't afford an air purifier so is the air inside four walls as bad as it is outside?” The doctor replied, “It's way better than being outdoors.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

From ‘AI-generated’ becoming part of our modern lexicon to ChatGPT, Face ID and Turnitin being just some examples of AI-powered technologies used practically everyday, AI is well and truly here – but what exactly is AI and how can you use it to work smarter? Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764069696.179414}

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart. Simply put, how international experience can benefit your career is by opening doors that domestic education often can’t.
