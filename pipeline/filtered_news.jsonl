In a first, the Ministry has shared a total of 6,28,305 (6.28 lakh) are enrolled at the school-level. In the previous year, MEA had reported 13.3 lakh students in higher education alone, which means that the 2025 figure marks a decline in university-level enrolments year-on-year. When considering the combined tally of school and higher education students, the overall 2025 number is higher only because school data was added for the first time. The top three destinations in 2025 across both schooling and university education were the United Arab Emirates (2,53,832 students), the United States (2,55,447 students), and Canada (4,27,085 students), making them the largest hubs of Indian students globally. MEA data shows a trend, that the number of Indian students in higher education overseas had risen consistently between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, there were 7.5 lakh students abroad in universities; this increased to 9.3 lakh in 2023 and reached a peak of 13.3 lakh in 2024. In contrast, the 2025 figure of 12.54 lakh shows a drop from last year, marking the first decline after three years of steady growth. This reversal comes at a time when several major destination countries have undergone significant policy shifts and diplomatic fluctuations affecting Indian student mobility over the past two years. Country-wise 2025 figures indicate that Canada continued to host the largest number of Indian students in universities and other tertiary institutions, with 4,27,085 enrolled. The United States followed with 2,55,247 students, and the United Kingdom had 1,73,190 students in higher education.

A question on the high dropout rate in Delhi government schools was asked by Swati Maliwal to the Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha during the Winter Session of the Parliament. Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system. To support their continued learning, NIOS enables such students to rejoin formal schooling in their parent institution once they successfully complete Class 10 through NIOS, said the Minister in the Rajya Sabha . The failing rate case also stands true for Class 10 students. Under the ‘NIOS Project,’ an average of 70 per cent of students who took the Class 10 examination have failed in the last four years — this was revealed by the Delhi Directorate of Education (DoE) in response to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by PTI.

University sources said this is the first time the issue has cropped up, as the fee payment system was manual before the pandemic. “We found it out when students under the self-finance category said that they could spot dues against their names when they sought to collect their documents after completing their course. That is when we realised that they had not paid their fees,” an AMU official said, adding that a clear picture of the number of students who did not pay fees is yet to emerge. “In the case of some students, they have collected their degrees.

These recommendations strengthen the government’s commitment to provide effective employment opportunities for Gujarat’s youth, who play a key role in the country’s development, it stated. Implementing these recommendations will complete the recruitment process within a year, ensure timely and transparent jobs, quickly fill long-pending vacancies, and realise the state government’s vision, improving administrative efficiency and public service delivery, the release noted. The GARC’s suggestions include drawing a 10-year recruitment calendar, completion of the job process within a fixed time frame, conducting joint recruitment and the Common Central Test (CET) and greater adoption of computer-based examinations, among others. The report said the government should estimate a 10-year recruitment calendar for each department based on future needs, identify priority emergency services and critical cadres, and recruit them promptly.

The new law will take effect next year, making Chile the latest country to restrict smartphone use among young students to reduce its harmful effects and curb classroom distractions. Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year. In response to rising concerns about young people and their mental health, parents and teachers in Chile have lobbied for such a law for years, arguing that the use of smartphones impairs students’ learning and emotional development.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank.

The restriction on recruitment under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Reservation of Seats in Education Institutions and Appointments of Posts and Services under the State) Act, 2022, will remain until further orders. However, the HC bench allowed the government to continue recruitment processes already notified before November 19, 2025, even if they follow the increased reservation percentages. The court also clarified that all appointments made through these ongoing recruitments will be subject to the final outcome of the petitions challenging the law. The division bench of Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C M Poonacha issued the interim order on November 27 while hearing two PILs filed by Mahendra Kumar Mitra of Raichur and Mahesh of Bengaluru . The petitions question the constitutional validity of the 2022 Act, particularly the hike in SC/ST reservation, from 15 per cent to 17 per cent for SCs and from 3 per cent to 7 per cent for STs. Other Backward Classes (OBCs) reservation continues to remain at 32 per cent, which takes over all reservations in the state to 56 per cent. The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government.

Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh.

Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test. But simply taking a mock test is not enough. The real value lies in taking each mock seriously, approaching it with exam-like discipline, analysing the results with patience and depth, and learning something meaningful from every attempt. Read More | How to balance JEE Main 2026 & Class 12th board exam preparation When mock tests are used thoughtfully and consistently, they help in developing a mental discipline, sharpening cognitive ability, improving precision, and building the confidence needed to face the actual JEE Main exam . They also play a major role in helping students understand their strengths and weaknesses while improving their test-taking skills. Before taking mock tests regularly, the first and most important step is to ensure that you choose the right mock tests. Not all mock tests available online or offline are equally useful, and selecting the wrong ones can result in either overconfidence or unnecessary fear. To identify which mock series is right for you, you must check whether the test pattern aligns with the latest JEE Main structure – the difficulty level, types of questions asked, marking scheme, and balance of topics.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Indian students weigh options amid growing uncertainty", "summary": "", "content": "–Ankit Mehra For decades, the United States has been considered the world’s most desirable higher education destination, especially in STEM fields. It powered the ambitions of Indian students chasing world-class education, research excellence and global careers. Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause. Also Read | US universities saw 17% drop in enrolments from international students in 2025-26 Adding to the uncertainty is speculation about the future of Optional Practical Training (OPT) , the 36-month work authorisation that has long been central to the ROI of a US STEM degree.

Since OPT is the bridge that enables practical experience, employability, and loan repayment, these discussions around changes signal instability and intensify risk assessments.

According to the US Open Doors Report 2025, Indian students comprise the largest international student enrollment, with 363,019, followed by China, South Korea, Canada, Vietnam, and Nepal. These students pursue higher education across a wide range of disciplines, reflecting both traditional preferences and emerging trends shaped by industry demand. Understanding the most sought-after courses offers insight into the academic interests and career goals that drive this student community. Here is the list of the top fields of study preferred by international students in the US, and which courses got higher enrolment as compared to the previous year. The total enrollment across all listed fields for 2024-25 is 1,177,766 students, representing a 4.53 per cent increase from the 1,126,690 students enrolled in the 2023-24 academic session.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

He said that someday, he’d ask the AI. When everyone snickered, he added, “You can laugh. It’s all right. But it really is what I actually believe .” He wasn’t kidding. Sitting again in front of an audience , this time across Max Hodak, the co-founder and CEO of Science Corp ., I can’t help but remember that moment with Altman. Pale-complexioned Hodak, wearing jeans and a black zip-up sweatshirt, looks more like he’s going to jump into a mosh pit than pitch a company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. But he’s got a sly sense of humor that keeps the room engaged. Hodak started programming when he was six, and as an undergraduate at Duke, he worked his way into the lab of Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneering neuroscientist who has since become publicly critical of commercial brain-computer interface ventures. In 2016, Hodak co-founded Neuralink with Elon Musk, serving as its president and essentially running day-to-day operations until 2021. When I ask what he learned working alongside Musk, Hodak describes a specific pattern. “We got into lots of situations together where something would happen. In my mind, I’d have two diametrically opposed possible solutions, and I would bring them to him, and I’d be like, ‘Is it A or B?’ And he’d look at it and be like, ‘It’s definitely B,’ and the problem would never come back.” After a few years of this, Hodak took what he’d learned and roped in three former Neuralink colleagues to launch Science Corp. about four years ago. Like Altman, Hodak describes his team’s improbable goal so placidly that I find myself believing that the limits of cognition are about to be overcome sooner than most of us realize.

On Thursday, PhonePe founder and group CEO Sameer Nigam said operating a consumer-facing quick-commerce app had become a distraction from the company’s core focus on small retailers. The company instead wants to concentrate on helping stores “achieve operational efficiency, improved margins and visibility,” he said, citing this as its primary objective. PhonePe launched Pincode in April 2023 as a major push into e-commerce, building it on the Indian government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The hyperlocal app offered groceries, medicines, food, electronics, and home décor from neighbourhood shops. It rolled out first in Bengaluru and later expanded to other cities. Within a little over a year of launch, Pincode pulled out of most categories except food. Earlier this year, the app shifted to a quick-commerce model , offering 10-minute deliveries through local kirana shops and retailers in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. The company also expanded the service to 10-minute medicine deliveries in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune in April. PhonePe’s Pincode utilized local shops and retail stores for its quick deliveries — a contrast to rivals like Swiggy, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto, which rely on dark stores. The shift did not help Pincode gain ground in the crowded segment, prompting PhonePe to wind down the service. Pincode was not PhonePe’s first move into e-commerce. In 2019, the company launched “Switch,” a super-app layer inside its payments app that offered access to food, grocery, shopping, and travel services. PhonePe has now shut down the Pincode app and redirected its website to PhonePe’s main site. The company said it will now focus on working with offline retailers by expanding its B2B offerings.

The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York. The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims. The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles. The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material in April. That suit is ongoing. Another nine from these publishers sued the model maker and its cloud provider in November, too. While creators have filed many lawsuits against model makers over using their work for model training, we’ll have to see if the courts weigh in about the legal liabilities of RAG as well.

And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise. This year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears that AI is coming for engineering jobs. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. “We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution.

In a December 3 letter sent to Waymo, regulators requested detailed information about its fifth-generation self-driving system and operations. Reuters was the first to report on the letter, which comes two months since the agency opened an investigation into Waymo over how its robotaxis perform around stopped school buses. The agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into the Alphabet-owned company in October after seeing footage of a Waymo autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. Waymo has said the bus was partially blocking the driveway and that the robotaxi could not see the flashing lights or stop sign. Waymo also said it issued a software update to its fleet to improve performance. Reports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing school buses has continued even after the fix. The Austin School District has reported 19 different instances of Waymo automated vehicles illegally passing school buses since the beginning of the 2025-26 school year. The school district noted in a letter to Waymo that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software on November 17. In an emailed statement, Waymo said safety is its top priority. The company also said data shows its robotaxis are improving road safety, noting a fivefold reduction in injury-related crashes compared to human drivers, and 12x fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians. “We have already made so", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/feds-ask-waymo-about-robotaxis-repeatedly-passing-school-buses-in-austin/", "timestamp": 1764939623.200736}

Now, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, double what it reported in September.", "content": "Micro1’s rapid climb over the past two years has pushed it into a cohort of AI companies scaling at breakneck speed. The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Today, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it announced its $35 million Series A at a $500 million valuation. Ansari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years. Micro1’s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with Scale AI following Meta’s $14 billion investment in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale’s CEO. While Micro1’s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn’t yet matched its rivals: Mercor’s more than $450 million, sources told TechCrunch, and Surge’s reported $1.2 billion in 2024. Ansari attributes Micro1’s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform. Beyond supplying expert-level data to leading AI labs, Ansari says two new segments, still barely visible today, are on track to reshape the economics of human data. The first involves non-AI-native Fortune 1000 enterprises that will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finan", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/micro1-a-scale-ai-competitor-touts-crossing-100m-arr/", "timestamp": 1764939623.681334}

Days after announcing AI chief John Giannandrea’s departure , and the loss of design exec Alan Dye to Meta , the iPhone maker shared the news of two more exec retirements. Kate Adams, who has served as Apple’s general counsel since 2017, will retire late next year, while Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president for Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, will retire in late January 2026. The company also announced the hiring of Jennifer Newstead, who will become its general counsel on March 1, 2026, reporting to chief executive Tim Cook, after a transition of duties from Adams. Newstead arrives from Meta, where she was chief legal officer. Before that, she served as the legal adviser of the U.S. Department of State, where she led the team advising the secretary of state on legal issues affecting the conduct of U.S. foreign relations. She also held other government positions in the past, including as general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, as a principal deputy assistant attorney general of the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, as associate White House counsel, and as a law clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court. Newstead will oversee both the Legal and Government Affairs organizations, noted Cook. “We couldn’t be more pleased to have Jennifer join our team,” he said. “She brings an extraordinary depth of experience and skill to the role, and will advance Apple’s important work all over the world.” During Adams’ time at Apple, the company faced increased antitrust regulation and lawsuits, largely focused on increasing competition in the app market. Meanwhile, Jackson, who had previously been appointed to the EPA before joining Apple in 2013, was involved with Apple’s climate initiatives, sustainability efforts, environmental impact, and DEI-focused endeavors, like its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative .

Musk replied to another user who had noticed the newest update to the software, known as FSD, was not flashing a warning as he used his phone while driving. The Tesla CEO wrote the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.” Musk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Nearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Despite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. Drivers initially needed to have their hands on the wheel even when FSD was engaged. That requirement was later removed and allowed drivers to have hands off as long as the in-cabin camera detected they were paying attention to the road. FSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver-assistance systems. Musk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver-assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident. Regulators have found more than a dozen fatal crashes in which Autopilot was active.

We’ve talked a lot about product-market fit, but this week we take a step back to something just as essential and far less discussed: founder-market fit. Investors love to ask, “What’s your competitive advantage?” Usually they’re talking about moats, IP, and defensibility. But before you ever write a line of code, you already have assets: your background, your experiences, your reputation, your network. Most founders simply forget to treat those as strategic tools. As the saying goes, “if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.” Be intentional about who you surround yourself with, build a focused network, and share your unique expertise boldly. This week, Isabelle sits down with Kyle Rudolph and Jon Walburg , co-founders of Alltroo , a fundraising platform that transforms celebrity access into once-in-a-lifetime charitable sweepstakes, from swimming with Michael Phelps to Oktoberfest at Arnold Schwarzenegger’s house. Kyle and Jon’s story shows that while celebrity status can open doors, it’s the execution, trust, and authenticity behind the company that keeps those doors open. Their credibility — rooted in Kyle’s career with the Minnesota Vikings, co-founder Jason Zucker’s career with the Buffalo Sabres, Jon’s operator background, and the early crowdfunding success that inspired their model — forms a powerful foundation of founder-market fit that’s hard to copy. Their pivot from exclusive $10,000 golf events to accessible $10 sweepstakes demonstrates how democratizing access can actually elevate prestige when done with intention. And while not every founder begins with celebrity reach, every founder does begin with a network and the ability to grow influence. The real differentiator is how you activate it: strategically, authentically, and in ways that create clear value. Thought leadership is one of the most ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/alltroo-co-founders-finding-founder-market-fit/", "timestamp": 1764939624.5532024}

Again.", "content": "Harvey on Thursday confirmed it closed a round of funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz, that values the legal AI startup at $8 billion after reports of the funding leaked in October . The startup raised $160 million in the round. This latest capital infusion came just months after it raised $300 million in a Series E round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation in February. Harvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey released some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams. As an industry entirely based on words, it makes sense that legal functions would be a perfect use case for LLMs: searching, summarizing, and drafting, all based on domain-specific training. But Harvey is also one of the best examples of how VCs are “kingmaking” these days . That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy. Given that Harvey was founded in 2022, it may be far enough ahead of competitors — both in customer acquisition and the reinforced training from working with so many law firms — that it is the king of this market. At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so.

On Thursday, Amnesty and a coalition of media partners, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz , Greek news site Inside Story , and Swiss outlet Inside IT , published a series of reports based on leaked material from Intellexa, including internal company documents, sales and marketing material, and training videos. Perhaps the most striking revelation is that people working at Intellexa could allegedly remotely access the surveillance systems of at least some of its customers via TeamViewer, an off-the-shelf tool that allows users to connect to other computers over the internet. The remote access is shown in a leaked training video revealing privileged parts of the Predator spyware system, including its dashboard, as well as the “storage system containing photos, messages and all other surveillance data gathered from victims of the Predator spyware,” Amnesty wrote in its report. (Amnesty published screenshots taken from the video, but not the full video.) The nonprofit researchers wrote that the leaked video shows apparent “live” Predator infection attempts “against real targets,” based on detailed information “from at least one infection attempt against a target in Kazakhstan.” The video contained the infection URL, the target’s IP address, and the software versions of the target’s phone. Companies that sell spyware to government agencies, such as NSO Group and the now-defunct Hacking Team, have long maintained that they never have access to the data of their customers’ targets, nor their customers’ systems. There are several reasons why. From the point of view of the spyware makers, they don’t want the potential legal liability if their customers use the spyware unlawfully.

The rules also close a loophole allowing police to issue tickets for driverless vehicles.", "content": "California regulators have released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, opened a 15-day comment period for the proposed revisions that ends December 18. California is home to numerous companies developing and testing autonomous vehicle technology in the state. And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads. The agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday. The revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. The self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said. The proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use self-driving trucks to carry freight along commerce-heavy freeways across states. “The California DMV’s latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/californias-ban-on-self-driving-trucks-could-soon-be-over/", "timestamp": 1764939625.4541974}

Her integrated model aligns incentives and proves conviction matters more than contracts.", "content": "Before she was a VC, Masha Bucher worked in PR and marketing — an experience that has shaped the way she runs Day One Ventures. After years of working in communications — including executive roles that gave her deep insight into how startups operate — Bucher realized she could either use her business acumen to become one of the most effective PR reps in the game, or evolve into something more. “I was seeing what was going on in business, and because I could understand the context, I understood business, and because I understood business, my PR pitches would be very business focused,” Bucher told TechCrunch on today’s episode of Equity. She founded Day One Ventures in 2018 after realizing she could create more impact — and make better returns — by investing in startups and providing them with integrated PR support. By combining these two functions, she could help portfolio companies more meaningfully while backing only the stories she truly believed in. “The structure of PR services is very misaligned,” Bucher said, noting that PR firms working on a contract basis often lean toward working slower so they can stretch out client payments. “For startups, it’s really important to move fast.” Beyond speed, there’s a cost barrier: “Early-stage companies shouldn’t be paying $10, $20, or $30 grand per month for six months to get one announcement in TechCrunch. I just don’t think that’s fair, and I don’t think it’s sustainable.” Day One’s integrated model allows Bucher to work with startups at critical early stages when they need support most. Younger startups might pivot or experience founder shake-ups, and “you need to be trusted to advise and help them make decisions.” Backing a company financially gives her something many traditional PR firms can’t offer: She’s literally invested in the story. “I have an ambition to be, ideally, the first investor in the most important and ambitious ideas and companies of our time,” Bucher said. “I think that starts with you understanding", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/why-day-one-ventures-masha-bucher-thinks-vcs-and-storytelling-go-hand-in-hand/", "timestamp": 1764939625.9991322}

The feature is rolling out now to global users on Facebook and Instagram on both the iOS and Android apps. The new AI assistant being tested is designed to offer more personalized help with things like account recovery, managing your profile, or updating your settings. This particular feature will first be available to Facebook users, but the company expects to roll it out to other apps in the future. The company claims that its use of AI systems is helping protect users’ accounts, noting that account hacks have decreased by over 30% globally across Facebook and Instagram. AI is also used to help identify and stop other threats, like phishing, suspicious logins, compromised accounts, and more. Additionally, Meta says that AI has helped it avoid disabling accounts by mistake more than ever before and has sped up the appeals process when mistakes occurred.

TikTok was first spotted testing a Nearby feed back in 2022 , when it had rolled it out to select users in Southeast Asia. “Posts in the Nearby Feed are shown to people based on location, the topic of the content, and when the content was posted,” TikTok explained in the blog post . “For example, people can see local content related to travel, events, food & drink, and other services based on their interests and engagement. For creators, this means their public posts may be available to people located in the city/region where they posted or tagged a location or service.” TikTok says sharing your location is optional and that the option is only available to users who are 18 or older. When your location setting is enabled, TikTok may use your device’s GPS-based location when the app is in use to provide more accurate, location-based recommendations. For iOS users, they will see a visible indicator when their location is being accessed. The company notes that it “continues to collect and use location information in line with local laws.” TikTok content won’t appear in the Nearby Feed if someone is under 18 years old, has a private account, or sets their post privacy to Friends or Only You. If people want to see “Nearby” content from a different place, they can change their location by selecting the location name and then following the steps to update it. The company says this can be useful when you’re traveling or want to do some research for your next trip. “The Nearby Feed also supports local economies by increasing visibility for small businesses, cultural institutions, and local creators,” TikTok wrote in the blog post. “The Nearby Feed helps d", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/tiktok-rolls-out-a-nearby-feed-to-display-local-content-in-select-countries/", "timestamp": 1764939627.2660959}

Company executives are mulling slashing the virtual reality platform’s budget by up to 30%, the report said, adding that any reductions would also include layoffs. If Meta does go ahead with such a plan, the move would reflect the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware — both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers. Since Meta’s rebrand in 2021, investors have been skeptical of the company’s allocation of resources to Metaverse projects, which lose billions of dollars each quarter. The company’s efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep . Meta’s shares rose , however, following this report.

A scenario where a parent asks someone on an airplane to switch seats so they can sit next to their young child is likely to invoke the same rush of anger. But those posts may trigger a Reddit moderator’s annoyance for a different reason—they are common themes within a growing genre of AI -generated, fake posts. These are examples that spring to mind for Cassie, one of dozens of moderators for r/AmItheAsshole . With over 24 million members, it's one of the biggest subreddits, and it explicitly bans AI-generated content and other made-up stories. Since late 2022, when ChatGPT first launched to the public, Cassie (who wanted to be referred to by first name only) and other people who volunteer their time to moderate Reddit posts have been struggling with an influx of AI content. Some of it is entirely AI-generated, while other users have taken to editing their posts and comments with AI programs like Grammarly. “It’s probably more prevalent than anybody wants to really admit, because it’s just so easy to shove your post into ChatGPT and say ‘Hey, make this more exciting,’” says Cassie, who thinks as much as half of all content being posted to Reddit may have been created or reworked with AI in some way. r/AmItheAsshole is a pillar of Reddit culture, a format that has inspired dozens if not hundreds of derivatives like r/AmIOverreacting, r/AmITheDevil, and r/AmItheKameena, a subreddit with over 100,000 members described as “Am I the asshole, but the Indian version.” Posts tend to feature stories about interpersonal conflicts, where Redditors can weigh in on who is wrong (“YTA” means “You’re the asshole,” while “ESH” means “Everyone sucks here”), who is right, and what the best course of action to take is moving forward.

The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1764939629.2510295}

The “overwhelming majority” of the images involved nudity and were “depicted adult content,” according to the researcher who uncovered the exposed trove of data, with some appearing to depict children or the faces of children swapped onto the AI-generated bodies of nude adults. Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos.

When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building.

Once during his time at Google, he extolled the societal benefits of a project only to be met with, “Oh Alex, you'd be a VP by now if you just stopped thinking through the implications of your actions.” Since that 2010s episode, the revenues and valuations in tech have skyrocketed, as has the blithe disregard for users. “It’s disgusting to see the industry as it currently is,” Komoroske says. Now, he’s doing something about it. Today, Komoroske and a loose group of concerned technologists are releasing The Resonant Computing Manifesto , an idealistic set of principles that attempts to recenter Silicon Valley around the values that have been lost in the scramble to hyperscale and maximize shareholder value. Komoroske and his coauthors are inviting anyone who, um, resonates with this jeremiad to sign it and proselytize those values in the products they create. Accompanying the manifesto is a shared doc of “the theses of resonant computing” where the community itself can provide input on shared principles.

Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs. In a post on the Meta platform Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the two would lead the new studio and “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” In his own Instagram post, Sorrentino confirmed the news .

Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface. If they want users to stay on their platform, they’re going to have to fix the UI.” The move comes as Meta continues to go absolutely all in on its AI efforts.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

In a conversation at WIRED’s Big Interview event with former acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration Leland Dudek and David Foote, outside counsel for the US Institute of Peace, Lavingia said, “I'm working at IRS for online accounts.” Lavingia said that he joined as a career employee after Sam Corcos, a DOGE operative and the chief information officer of the Treasury Department, reached out to him after reading an article he'd written about his experience in government, offering to put him in touch with people who could help him find a role in which he could put his talents to use as a federal worker. When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should. Lavingia was previously assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), where he was part of a group of technologists brought into the government in the early months of DOGE’s takeover. In 2015, he had applied to be a part of the US Digital Service (USDS), now the US DOGE Service . Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work. At the VA, Lavignia attempted to use an AI tool to write code for the agency’s systems and suggested the agency move away from paper forms entirely. He built a tool to “munch” data about the agency’s contracts to identify those that could be cut. He was fired from his role at the VA in May after he spoke to a reporter about his work at DOGE.

The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday. The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command’s classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.” The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate , because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security . The IG report notes that Hegseth is the “head original classification authority in the DOD” and therefore decides what information needs to be classified and whether to declassify information. “We concluded that the Secreta", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/signalgate-inspector-general-report-hegseth-change/", "timestamp": 1764939630.7476864}

But prices won’t drop for years, and consumers will spend more on gas in the meantime.", "content": "The Trump administration says its proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, announced officially in the Oval Office on Wednesday, is an attempt to shave dollars off the ballooning cost of new cars in the US. But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change. The Biden administration took a carrot-and-stick approach to vehicles and their effect on the environment. Light-duty cars and trucks alone are responsible for some 15 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The previous administration tried to boost electric vehicle adoption by using tax subsidies for consumers and manufacturers interested in building fuel-efficient vehicles and technologies, including batteries. It also introduced penalties for those unable or unwilling to meet stricter environmental standards. Automakers should be able to hit next decade’s goals by selling more electric vehicles, the government then reasoned.

That’s when women are supposed to start getting mammograms and men are supposed to start paying a bit more attention to their prostates. Over the next decade, you’ll start getting colonoscopies, and from then on out, it feels like a gradual march of doctor’s appointments and tests until your body collapses sometime in your seventies or eighties. But what if modern medicine has the timeline all wrong? What if we’re testing some middle-aged people unnecessarily for diseases they’ll most likely never get, while blindly ignoring twentysomethings who might be prone to colon cancer? Is there a way that, even as we age, we can stay healthy in a way that’s both meaningful and not reliant on taking 12 horse-sized pills every morning? Eric Topol certainly thinks so. The cardiologist, vice president of Scripps Research, and author of Super Agers is convinced that new innovations in AI-assisted medicine, bioengineering, and anti-inflammatory awareness could have potential to revolutionize the way people age. During WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday, Topol told features editor Sandra Upson that while he was working on Super Agers he learned that there’s a difference between lifespan and health span and that neither has much to do with genetics. Someone who’s “wellderly,” or over 65 and generally healthy, has pretty much the same genetic makeup as someone who’s elderly and facing major health challenges, like heart disease, cancer, or a neurodegenerative disorder. Instead, Topol said, there appears to be a correlation between having a healthy immune system and aging healthily. Lifestyle can influence how healthy you are, too, with Topol advocating for eating a diet low in ultra-processed foods, focusing on sleep quality over sleep quantity, and getting out in nature.

The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically. I don't know what it's going to change to, but it's what I'm spending almost every waking hour thinking about.” As a company, Cloudflare’s offerings are geared toward making it faster and safer to access content online. But as the AI industry has exploded and AI giants have emerged, Prince says he’s become increasingly focused on how Cloudflare can leverage its position to discourage consolidation and safeguard the internet as a place where businesses and creators of every size can survive—or, ideally, thrive. “We need to be able to make sure that businesses large and small flourish on a fair playing ground,” Prince said. “That is the future that we're trying to play for.

We have to make the risks manageable. And that's why we talk about it so much.” More than 300,000 startups, developers, and companies use some version of Anthropic’s Claude model and Amodei said that, through the company’s dealings with those brands, she’s learned that, while customers want their AI to be able to do great things, they also want it to be reliable and safe. “No one says, ‘We want a less safe product,’” Amodei said, likening Anthropic’s reporting of its model’s limits and jailbreaks to that of a car company releasing crash-test studies to show how it has addressed safety concerns. It might seem shocking to see a crash-test dummy flying through a car window in a video, but learning that an automaker updated their vehicle’s safety features as a result of that test could sell a buyer on a car. Amodei said the same goes for companies using Anthropic’s AI products, making for a market that is somewhat self-regulating. “We’re setting what you can almost think of as minimum safety standards just by what we’re putting into the economy,” she said.

Chu . At WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco, the onetime YouTuber and Crazy Rich Asians director said that working with acts like Justin Bieber taught him the value of connecting with fans online during the creation process. While directing Bieber’s concert film, Never Say Never , in the late aughts, Chu said the then-14-year-old star used Twitter to introduce Chu to fans. After Bieber posted a clip joking that the director was following him around on set, Chu told WIRED’s senior culture editor, Manisha Krishnan, he began to watch his online followers grow by tens of thousands of people almost instantly, something that really drove home the power of direct connection with a fan base. Working with Bieber, Chu said, made him realize that “the story is being told before you even start shooting, and after you’re done with the movie, you have to continue that story.” That’s why he believes fans have felt so invested in Wicked —and its sequel, Wicked: For Good —and why the movie’s marketing and press tours have leaned so heavily on the relationships built by the cast while filming. Bonds, like the one between stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, came from the immense pressure the crew felt to make something not only great but also bankable. “We only had each other, so we’re very, very bonded,” Chu said, likening the relationship to that of Silicon Valley developers working long hours together to deliver a new product. A Bay Area native, Chu said he has always felt partially indebted to the tech world for his start in entertainment. In the ’90s, when Chu was just a teenager, tech-minded customers at his parents’ Chinese restaurant would slip him computers, video cards, and software when they heard he was interested in filmmaking, giving him a leg up on fellow students when he went to college at the University of Southern California. “I was built by the gen", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-jon-chu-wicked/", "timestamp": 1764939631.5909002}

Authorities identified the man as Brian J. Cole Jr., a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. The arrest marks a major break in a case that has vexed authorities for nearly five years. Cole, 30, is charged with transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, intimidate, or destroy property and with attempting to damage and destroy the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees by means of an explosive device. If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison. According to an affidavit , investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Cole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day. Senior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it. “Though it had been nearly five ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/", "timestamp": 1764939631.8763118}

Today, when Su took the stage at WIRED’s Big Interview conference in San Francisco, she had something else in her sights: the AI bubble . When asked by WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode if the tech industry is in an AI bubble, her response was “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” The AI industry is going to need scores of chips from companies like AMD, and fears of such a bubble, Su said, are “somewhat overstated.” That might sound bold, but boldness is Su’s whole deal. Since she became AMD’s CEO in 2014, she has increased the company’s market cap from $2 billion to $300 billion. Now, Su is betting big on the need for much more computing power for AI, and the data centers needed to provide that. Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead for AMD. One is all of those data centers being built, and another is getting its chips out into the hands of as many customers as possible. During the discussion, Goode asked the AMD CEO about selling chips to China. She confirmed that AMD will pay a 15 percent tax instituted by the Trump administration on MI308 chips it plans to resume shipping to China. The US government previously halted sales of the chips to China, but then began reviewing applications again over the summer. AMD said earlier this year that US export restrictions on the MI308 chips would cost the company roughly $800 million. Earlier this year, AMD made a huge deal with OpenAI, under which the AI company will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct GPUs over the course of several years.

But he would really rather you didn’t call what he’s selling now a “burner phone.” Yes, he dreams of a future where anyone in the US can get a working smartphone—complete with cellular coverage and data—without revealing their identity, even to the phone company. But to call such anonymous phones “burners” suggests that they’re for something illegal, shady, or at least subversive. The term calls to mind drug dealers or deep-throat confidential sources in parking garages. With his new startup, Merrill says he instead wants to offer cellular service for your existing phone that makes near-total mobile privacy the permanent, boring default of daily life in the US. “We're not looking to cater to people doing bad things,” says Merrill. “We're trying to help people feel more comfortable living their normal lives, where they're not doing anything wrong, and not feel watched and exploited by giant surveillance and data mining operations. I think it’s not controversial to say the vast majority of people want that.” That’s the thinking behind Phreeli, the phone carrier startup Merrill launched today, designed to be the most privacy-focused cellular provider available to Americans. Phreeli, as in, “speak freely,” aims to give its user a different sort of privacy from the kind that can be had with end-to-end encrypted texting and calling tools like Signal or WhatsApp . Those apps hide the content of conversations, or even, in Signal’s case, metadata like the identities of who is talking to whom. Phreeli instead wants to offer actual anonymity. It can’t help government agencies or data brokers obtain users’ identifying information because it has almost none to share.

While DJI's continual stream of steadily improving, ever-reliable drones almost always impresses, what Antigravity has done with its first-ever product, the A1 , essentially invents an entirely novel subcategory: the 360 drone. Using the same shoot-first, frame-later technology as the Insta360 X5 (Antigravity is technically a distinct company from Insta360, but the brands have close ties ), the A1 has twin cameras to capture everything around it, allowing the user to reframe the footage later using mobile or desktop apps. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 Each of the cameras uses a 1/1.28-inch sensor and an ultrawide lens to capture a hemispherical view. In-camera software then joins the two views into a near-seamless single spherical video, completely removing the drone and its propellers from view (in much the same way Insta360's cameras remove a selfie stick). The 360-degree clips can be as high as 8K and 30 frames per second in resolution, but 5.2K and 4K options are available for users requiring 60 fps or 100 fps frame rates. When output to a standard \"flat\" video, however, the resolution is limited to 4K or 1080p.

Zanskar, which uses AI to find hidden geothermal resources deep underground, says that it has identified a new commercially viable site for a potential power plant. The discovery, the company claims, is the first of its kind made by the industry in decades. The find is the culmination of years of research on how to find these resources—and points to the growing promise of geothermal energy . “When we started this company, I think the most common message we heard was that geothermal was dead—it was a history of bones, a graveyard of so many failures,” says Carl Hoiland, a cofounder of Zanskar. “To get to this point where, thanks to these new tools and these new capabilities, you can systematically find these sites and systematically derisk them—we just think this is the first full-scale signal that the tide has turned.” In theory, geothermal power is one of the simplest methods of generating renewable energy. Reservoirs of hot water underground, heated by the Earth’s core, produce steam that can then be used to power turbines at the surface, requiring no excessive mining or complex conversions of fuel. Geothermal resources are especially accessible in areas where tectonic plates meet and the Earth’s crust is thinner, making the western US a great candidate for power plants. The world’s largest developed geothermal field, in California, is built on the site of hot springs that humans have used for thousands of years; the first power plant was built there in the early 1920s . But a big part of the geothermal puzzle is actually finding these resources. It’s rare to find hot springs or vents at the surface that lead to a productive spot to put a power plant. Most geothermal systems that are hot enough to make electricity are deep underground, and there is no evidence at the surface. These are known as hidden or blind systems—and identifying where they are is surprisingly challengin", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/startup-found-hidden-source-geothermal-energy/", "timestamp": 1764939632.760627}

Also known as shooting stars, meteors happen when Earth’s orbital path crosses a path of debris left by a comet and that material burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere. Watching a meteor shower is one of the most accessible ways to engage with the night sky. The next shower are the Geminids, a busy and bright shower that peaks in mid-December, offering the chance to see hundreds of shooting stars each hour. This is just one of nine major meteor showers that grace skies throughout the year, and details of when they will appear in the northern hemisphere are listed below—so mark your 2026 calendar for these. You don’t need any special equipment to see a meteor shower—in fact, using devices like binoculars or telescopes actually prevents you from seeing meteors, because they travel too fast to be seen through the lenses of such equipment. All you need are your eyes, a dark sky with little to no moonlight, and a location that’s away from excess light, as moonlight and light pollution can wash out shooting stars. Note that the moon appears (rises) and disappears (sets) in the night sky at different times depending on what time zone you are in. All moonrise/moonset times in this piece are for the eastern US. You can use tools like Time and Date’s moonrise/moonset calendar or this tool from the US Naval Observatory to check the precise moonrise/moonset times in your exact location. You should allow your eyes about half an hour to adjust to the darkness. If you need to use a flashlight while outside, use one with red light instead of white to preserve your night vision. Each meteor shower is named after its radiant, or the constellation that the shower appears to come from. A meteor shower’s radiant usually needs to be above the horizon before you can see the meteors.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism . According to the documents, LDWF signed a memorandum of agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in May, which gives the wildlife agency the authority to detain people suspected of immigration violations and to transfer them into ICE custody. Since then, at least six men entered ICE custody after coming into contact with or being detained by LDWF officers. None of the men were issued criminal charges at the time they came into contact with LDWF officers, the documents show. Two of the men were known by ICE to have been in the country legally at the time the agency took them into custody. The documents also indicate that at least one “joint patrol” took place in a Louisiana wildlife management area in which LDWF agents were accompanied by officers with Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard. The memorandum of agreement between ICE and LDWF makes no mention of CBP or the possibility of working with the agency as part of the agreement. However, the documents indicate that a relationship with CBP may have been facilitated through LDWF’s partnership with ICE. LDWF partnered with ICE under the agency’s 287(g) program, named after the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that enables officers and employees at the state or local level to perform some of the functions of US immigration officers, such as investigating, apprehending, detaining, or transporting people suspected of violating immigration law.

The iX3 is the first of six cars based on BMW’s much-trailed new modular EV platform, the “ Neue Klasse ,” that arrives with new motors, new inverters, new batteries, new charging tech, new interior display wizardry, and, perhaps most importantly, a fancy new central computer brain designed to make these latest electric Beemers drive better than anything on the road right now. The Neue Klasse range uses the sixth generation of BMW eDrive tech, boasting “ cell-to-pack ” batteries with liquid-cooled cylindrical cells consisting of higher nickel and less cobalt content for a 20-percent bump in energy density. A lighter 800-volt electric architecture boosts charging speeds by a third, and at up to 400 kilowatts. This means 200 miles can be added in just 10 minutes in ideal conditions. Efficiency is a claimed 4.1 m/kWh. Now the headline stat: the iX3 has a 500-mile WLTP max-range figure, or 400 in the more realistic US EPA test.

Activists Are Fighting Back", "summary": "Half of the country now requires age verification to watch porn or access “harmful” content. Digital rights advocates are pushing back against legislation they say will make the internet less safe.", "content": "Members of Congress considered 19 online safety bills Tuesday that may soon have a major impact on the future of the internet as age-verification laws have spread to half of the US and around the world . In response, digital and human rights organization Fight for the Future is hosting a week of events —across Reddit , LinkedIn, and various livestreams —to raise awareness of how it believes these bills are setting a dangerous precedent by making the internet more exploitative rather than safer. Many of the proposed bills include a clause for ID or age verification, which forces people to upload an ID, allow a face scan, or otherwise authenticate that they are not a minor before viewing adult content. Fight for the Future says the policies will lead to increased censorship and surveillance. Among the 19 bills considered at the hearing conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed with sweeping bipartisan approval in the Senate last year, and the Reducing Exploitative Social Media Exposure for Teens Act , which would ban tech companies from allowing minors under the age of 16 on their platforms. In addition to age verification, the bills raised concerns over issues of parental controls, consumer research of minors, AI, and data privacy. “We’re seeing this huge wave toward ID checks being the norm in tech policy, and it felt like we needed to capture the already activated communities who are not feeling heard in Congress,” says Sarah Philips, a campaigner with Fight for the Future. “If you look on YouTube, if you see people making content about KOSA or responding to a lot of this legislation, it’s very unpopular with people. But it’s viewed on the Hill as very common-sense.” Missouri’s age-gate law took effect earlier this week, meaning 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

This could have implications far outside gaming.", "content": "The video game Valorant , a fast-paced team-based shooter , has recently become a testing ground for a promising new direction in artificial intelligence research. The game’s developers at Riot Games (a Tencent subsidiary) are using 3D-native AI models to prototype new characters, scenes, and storylines, according to a researcher familiar with the company’s efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. While many AI models can generate text, images, and video, Tencent’s Hunyuan (混元 or “first mix”) family of models can dream up 3D objects and interactive scenes. The source says that Tencent’s models are also being used by the developers of another Tencent game, GKART , and by some independent developers, too. Tencent declined to comment. “The games industry requires a lot of investment,” the source says. “Previously you would need a month to design a character. Now you can just type in some text, and Hunyuan can give you four choices in 60 seconds.” The news is an early signal that models capable of understanding and re-creating the physical world could become a standard ingredient in game design. In addition to generating game content, these models could also enable more advanced virtual and augmented reality and help robots learn to do new things. “There’s a real explosion of 3D vision research nowadays,” says Alexander Raistrick , a graduate student at Princeton University working on novel approaches to generating 3D content. “There are many killer applications: There's content creation, there’s self driving, and there’s a whole stack of problems involved in augmented reality.” Raistrick adds that video games are an obvious application for 3D AI models. “Outputting 3D meshes [a standard way of representing 3D objects] is your typical kind of bread and butter of game development,” he says.

So she decided to self-deport . The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims. Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

Papaya also offers vitamin C and vitamin E which add antioxidant support for the retina. Eat as a mid meal or smoothie.​ Blueberries contain anthocyanins which help counter oxidative stress in the retina. They appear in many clinical nutrition guides for eye support along with other berries.

Rajasthan court weighs in", "summary": "", "content": "An 18 year old woman and a 19 year old man from Kota filed a protection plea after family threats. They voluntarily entered a live in relationship and signed a written live in agreement dated 27 October 2025. Police did not act on their complaint. The State said the man is under 21 so he should not be allowed to cohabit. The court disagreed and said the ability to marry and the ability to choose how to live are distinct legal questions. Adulthood confers autonomy. The court ruled that two consenting adults aged 18 plus can legally live together. Marriageable age is not the test for personal liberty. Live in relationships are not illegal or an offence in India. Choices of adults are protected by Article 21. Article 21 of the Constitution protects the right to life and personal liberty. That includes choosing a partner and where to live. If both partners are 18 plus and consenting, the State should not interfere in their decision to cohabit. The court told district police to assess the threat, act as per law, and provide protection if risk is real. The order underlines the duty of the State to safeguard life and liberty of adults, regardless of marital status. It clarifies that adults can live together without meeting the marriageable age threshold. It reaffirms that live in relationships are legitimate choices and not criminal. Couples facing threats can seek court protection. It does not amend marriage laws or the statutory age for marriage. It does not grant live in relationships the same legal status as marriage in inheritance or spousal rights. It does not validate any relationship involving minors. ​ (With inputs from TOI) Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/can-livein-relationships-start-before-marriage-age-rajasthan-court-weighs-in/slideshow/125789051.cms", "timestamp": 1764939658.2773008}

This one bad habit is undoing all your progress", "summary": "", "content": "Exercise needs oxygen and flexible arteries. Smoking reduces oxygen to muscles and stiffens blood vessels, so the same workout not only feels harder, it delivers fewer gains. The clash is immediate during exercise and lingers into recovery as well. Acute smoking before or after exercise reduces performance and raises central blood pressure. Over time the same mechanisms increase cardiovascular disease risk, which undercuts the long game for fitness.​ Smokers show lower maximal oxygen uptake and poorer cardiorespiratory responses even in healthy adults. That means quicker fatigue and slower pace on runs, rows, and cycles at the same perceived effort.​ Smoking damages the endothelium, which is the lining that releases nitric oxide for vessel dilation. Stiffer arteries limit blood flow during sets and sprints, so pumps are weaker and recovery between efforts is slower.​ Lighting up right after cardio delays heart rate and blood pressure recovery and cancels the usual post-exercise drop in arterial stiffness. It also blunts the temporary boost in conduit vessel function seen after a good session.​ Even one cigarette activates the sympathetic nervous system and reduces heart rate variability, increasing myocardial oxygen demand at the worst time for a recovering heart. That adds avoidable strain.​ Resistance training can raise testosterone and lower cortisol over weeks, but nicotine exposure is linked with lower testosterone and higher cortisol, which undermines muscle growth and repair. Gains feel sluggish and plateaus come early.​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

What it reveals about kidney health", "summary": "", "content": "Creatinine is a waste from muscle activity that kidneys filter out. When blood creatinine rises the kidneys may be filtering less well. Doctors read it with the estimated glomerular filtration rate to judge kidney function.​ A sudden jump can signal acute kidney injury. A steady elevation for 3 months or more points toward chronic kidney disease. Both need prompt evaluation and follow up.​ Creatinine is paired with estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin tests. Together they show how well kidneys filter and whether protein leakage is present.​ Dehydration, infection, certain painkillers called nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and heavy exercise can raise creatinine temporarily. Levels often improve when the trigger is removed.​ Diabetes, high blood pressure and primary kidney diseases can keep creatinine high. These need medical care to slow damage and protect kidney function.​ Less urine, swelling in legs or face, fatigue, nausea, confusion, and irregular heartbeat can appear if kidneys are struggling and electrolytes are off. Seek care urgently for sudden changes.​ Doctors stage chronic kidney disease using estimated glomerular filtration rate from G1 to G5 and urine albumin from A1 to A3. Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albumin mean higher risk.​ See a kidney specialist if creatinine stays high. ​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/creatinine-too-high-what-it-reveals-about-kidney-health/slideshow/125788448.cms", "timestamp": 1764939662.8583856}

Real buttermilk is the light, tangy liquid left after churning butter. Real buttermilk is lower in fat and lactose than milk because the butter and some milk sugar are used up in churning and fermentation. Helpful bacteria, called probiotics, stay in the drink and can support smoother digestion and less bloating for many people.​ There are two practical versions at home. One is traditional buttermilk that comes after you churn cream into butter. The other is cultured buttermilk, where you ferment milk using a small starter that already contains live bacteria. Both give that tangy, easy to digest drink. Boil and cool full fat milk, then skim the malai (cream) into a box in the fridge for a few days. When you have enough, churn the cold cream with a blender or hand whisk until butter separates. You will see lumps of butter and a thin, cloudy liquid.​ Once the butter forms, strain everything through a clean muslin cloth. Tie and squeeze gently so the liquid drips out into a bowl. This light tangy liquid is traditional buttermilk. Chill it, whisk once, add a little salt and drink it the same day for best taste.​ If you do not make butter often, you can ferment milk. Take one litre of pasteurised milk and warm it till it feels slightly lukewarm. Stir in two tablespoons of store bought cultured buttermilk that mentions live active cultures, cover and leave at room temperature for a day.​ Buttermilk is the light liquid left after butter is removed or milk is fermented with a starter. Chaas is usually buttermilk whisked with spices and water. Lassi is thicker, made from curd with more fat and milk solids, often sweetened or flavoured with fruit.

In 2025 the American Cancer Society estimated about 107,320 new colon cancer cases in the United States. Knowing early signs can speed diagnosis and improve outcomes.​ Feeling unusually tired or sleeping more can be a clue. Colon cancers can bleed slowly which causes iron deficiency anemia and low hemoglobin. Low blood levels reduce oxygen delivery and make you feel wiped out. Get a blood count if fatigue lingers.​ Drenching night sweats can occur when tumors trigger inflammatory signals. Night sweats are not specific to cancer but deserve attention if paired with fever or weight loss. Track patterns and see a clinician if persistent.​ New constipation or diarrhea that lasts more than a few weeks needs evaluation. A growing tumor can narrow the colon and alter stool flow. Persistent change, pencil thin stools, or urgency are reasons to book a visit.​ Blood in stool is a red flag. Bright red blood may come from the left colon or rectum while darker maroon stool can signal bleeding higher up. Hemorrhoids also bleed but repeated bleeding needs prompt testing.​ ​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/colon-cancer-in-30s-signs-doctors-want-you-to-spot/slideshow/125787769.cms", "timestamp": 1764939665.2524292}

Dr Rashmi Shetty explains how oxidative stress , lack of sleep , pollution, and UV rays make hair roots weak and disturb the hair cycle in her Instagram reel. When you support your hair cycle with good nutrition and daily scalp care, your hairs grow stronger, thicker, and more resilient naturally. Dr Rashmi Shetty explains that oxidative stress from pollution, UV rays , and free radicals directly damages hair roots. Protecting your scalp from environmental stress is one of the simplest ways to stop hair fall. According to Dr Rashmi Shetty , one of the most underrated causes of hair fall is poor sleep. Late nights reduce repair hormones , increase stress levels, and make your scalp more sensitive. This leads to noticeable shedding. Restorative sleep is essential for healthy, strong hair. Pollution isn’t just bad for skin; it harms hair too . Dr Shetty says that daily exposure to sun and polluted air also weakens hair. Over time hair becomes dull and weak. Protecting your hair outdoors is essential for long-term strength. Your hair is always cycling. Dr Rashmi Shetty explains that hair grows in phases; if your hair keeps falling, it’s because too many strands have moved to the exogen phase. When oxidative stress, lack of sleep, or poor diet hits, hair leaves anagen early and enters exogen sooner. Your food is your hair’s fuel. Dr Rashmi Shetty explains that hair needs protein and fiber, so nutrition directly affects strength. Whole foods, good fats, iron-rich meals, and antioxidants help your strands stay in the anagen phase longer. Your scalp is also skin, so treat it like it matters. According to Dr Rashmi Shetty , most hair problems start on the scalp. Keeping the scalp clean, hydrated , and irritation-free helps hairs to stay strong. Cleanse gently, improve circulation, and avoid heavy products that suffocate the roots. Hair fall doesn’t improve overnight; it improves when daily habits change.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

In a popular Instagram post, Haakenson highlighted everything from food habits to family structures — sparking a lively discussion online. In America, honking signals anger; in India, it’s more like — “Hi, I’m here, please move”. “Spicy” in the US = mild heat. “Spicy” in India = may result in digestive adventures for foreigners. Haakenson says Americans may act like you don’t exist — but in India, people instantly want to know where you’re from and where you’re going. Bins in the US. Wherever is convenient, in many parts of India — according to her post. USA: Follow the rules, drive individually. India: A system of “controlled chaos” only locals understand. US: Four seasons. India: Hot, monsoon and ‘surprise extra heat’. Quiet churches in America vs. temples and festivals that can take over entire cities in India.

As the passengers waited, and waited some more, for the flights to resume, many missed important meetings, lost hope of reaching their loved ones suffering medical emergencies, and had to skip out on some of the most cherished memories of their lives. Among these IndiGo passengers were a tech couple from Karnataka's Hubballi, who had to miss their own wedding reception. However, the couple still managed to be a part of their post-wedding function, just virtually, according to a NDTV report. The newlyweds, both software engineers working in Bengaluru, were scheduled to fly to Gujarat Bhavan in Hubballi, but IndiGo flight cancellations prevented them from travelling. Medha Kshirsagar of Hubballi and Sangama Das of Odisha got married in Bhubaneswar on November 23. A formal reception was arranged at the bride's hometown on Wednesday.

Several of the couple's relatives travelling also faced cancellations. However, with guests already gathered and all preparations in place, the bride's parents stepped in and took the couple's place for the rituals.

This marks the third consecutive day of flight chaos for the airline, triggering widespread anger online over delays, cancellations and lack of communication. Among those affected was Arun Prabhudesai, founder and CEO of Armoks Media, who posted a viral video on X (formerly Twitter) after his repeatedly delayed Pune–Delhi flight left passengers with no clear answers. Calling out the airline’s operations, he wrote: “SHAME ON YOU IndiGo6E. One of my biggest events of the year is in danger of getting cancelled because of your absolute incompetence… Every time we ask the crew if the flight will actually take off or get cancelled, there’s zero clarity. No answers, no accountability.” His flight, first scheduled for 1:05 pm, was pushed to 1:25 pm, then 3:30 pm, and eventually 6 pm. Prabhudesai claimed that the uncertainty put his major event — and lakhs spent on it — at risk. Several other passengers shared similar experiences online, with many pointing to severe crew shortages and new DGCA norms that have stalled operations. On Friday, IndiGo issued an apology to passengers impacted by disruptions on domestic flights departing from Delhi. The statement said: “We will ensure that all refunds of your cancellations will be processed automatically to your original mode of payment.”  The airline added that it has arranged thousands of hotel rooms across different cities, along with surface transport, to support stranded customers and minimise inconvenience.

The Rajya Sabha MP said that this culture forces gig workers to risk their lives, compelling them to meet punishing deadlines under intense pressure. Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Rajya Sabha, Chadha said that delivery personnel are not robots, but individuals who are someone's father, husband, brother, or son. \"I want to tell you that these people are not robots. They are also someone's father, husband, brother, or son. The House should think about them. And the cruelty of this 10-minute delivery should end,\" he said. The AAP leader said while consumers hope their food reaches them in 10 minutes, the House should also think about the welfare of gig workers. Chadha described delivery personnel working for platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, ride-hailing services such as Ola and Uber, and home service providers as the \"invisible wheels of the Indian economy\". \"Every day we press a button on our mobile phone app and get a notification that your order is on its way, order delivered, your ride has arrived. But behind this notification, there is often a person whom we do not acknowledge,\" he said. He noted that while quick commerce and instant delivery have helped companies achieve billion-dollar valuations and become unicorns, the condition of gig workers remains worse than that of daily wage labourers. Chadha highlighted three major challenges faced by gig workers: pressure of speed and delivery time, customer harassment, and hazardous working conditions. On the dangerous trend of 10-minute delivery, he said workers are forced to overspeed and jump red lights, fearing rating drops, incentive cuts, app logouts and ID blocks. \"A delivery boy standing on the red light keeps thinking that if he is late, the rating will fall, the incentive will be cut, the app will log out, and the ID", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/in-rajya-sabha-raghav-chadha-slams-10-minute-delivery-culture-calls-gig-workers-invisible-wheels-of-india-s-economy-11764925347034.html", "timestamp": 1764939683.7057335}

People had to cancel their plans or make alterations at the last moment. Such events are rare. However, in the past as well, there have been instances of air travel disruptions that have caused havoc with people’s plans. Here are five occasions in the past when air travel was left seriously paralyzed. Earlier in this year, a government shutdown in the US led to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) being short-staffed, forcing it to make heavy cuts to air traffic. As many as 40 airports were chosen for a reduction of air traffic, according to Travel Radar. The disruptions reached a crescendo when, on 8 November, the number of flights cancelled or delayed reached 5,000. Almost 13,000 air traffic controllers were working without pay, leading to issues for the authorities as many called in sick or looked for alternative employment. Once the shutdown was over, things went back to normalcy. On 12 June 2025, the Air India Flight 171 going from Ahmedabad to London crashed shortly after take-off, killing all but one person on board. After the tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171, which was en route to London from Ahmedabad, all flights from Delhi Airport Terminal 1 to Ahmedabad were cancelled as a precautionary measure, India Today reported. Services resumed later. In November 2025, aviation giant Airbus was forced to change its schedule due to problems with the A320 planes, the main model used by the company. The issues affected 6,000 flights, as per Politico. “Intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls,” a statement from the company said.

As passengers suffer from operational chaos, let’s find out if they are entitled to refunds for delayed or cancelled flights. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ), it is mandatory for airlines to issue a complete refund when a flight is cancelled. Check the rules. When an airline cancels a flight, it must notify passengers at least two weeks prior to departure. It must offer either a refund or an alternate flight. If the cancellation is informed less than two weeks but at least 24 hours in advance, the passenger can still choose a refund or an alternate flight. The airline must give compensation plus a full refund or an alternate flight: The compensation is ₹ 5,000 for flights of up to one hour, ₹ 7,500 for flights of up to two hours, and ₹ 10,000 for flights exceeding two hours. The airline has the option to pay the basic fare plus fuel charge, whichever is lower. Passengers will also get waiting facilities at the airport. No compensation applies if the passenger did not provide contact details. There will be no compensation if cancellation occurs due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline’s control. Airlines must give support to passengers when a flight is delayed. If you have checked in on time and the airline expects a delay, it must provide basic facilities, such as food and refreshments, to its passengers . Such facilities must be provided if the delay crosses two hours for short flights, three hours for medium flights and four hours for longer flights. If a domestic flight is expected to be delayed by more than six hours, the airline must offer you a choice between an alternate flight within six hours or a full refund.

Fintrekk Capital founder Amit Kumar Gupta detailed how a distant relative’s destination wedding had to be postponed amid the ongoing IndiGo crisis. Speaking to Livemint, Gupta said that 48 guests were booked to travel from Delhi to Goa on the same IndiGo flight, which was repeatedly delayed and eventually cancelled, derailing the family’s wedding plans. With most peak-season bookings in Goa being non-refundable, the family received only a credit note valid for the next 24 months. “The wedding has now been shifted to the NCR next month due to the lack of available venues in December,” Gupta said. He further said that the family had booked a 5-star hotel for four nights—from 4 to 7 December —at roughly ₹ 35,000 per night, and had also paid ₹ 15–20 lakh in event management fees. This pushed the total loss to an estimated ₹ 16.4–21.4 lakh. Calling the situation “astonishing”, Gupta criticised IndiGo for failing to anticipate the disruption or alert passengers in advance. He also expressed displeasure over what he termed a “useless inquiry” by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), arguing it would do little to reduce the “major losses of time, money, and energy” faced by thousands of travellers. Gupta urged the government to step in immediately, impose strict penalties on IndiGo’s management, and hand over operations to an independent professional team, alleging the current leadership has “made a total mess of the travel experience”. He further warned that IndiGo’s widespread operational cuts could affect even non-travellers in the coming weeks, as reduced flight slots may push fares sharply higher. “This will impact everyone in the near term.

Justice Anoop Dhand delivered the judgement while hearing a plea for protection filed by an 18-year-old woman and a 19-year-old man from Kota, who told the court that they were living together out of free will. The couple told the court that they had executed a live-in agreement on October 27, 2025. The petitioners alleged that the woman's family opposed the relationship and had threatened to kill them, and that their complaint to the Kota police went unaddressed. Opposing the petition, public prosecutor Vivek Choudhary argued that because the man had not attained 21 years -- the minimum legal age for marriage for men -- he should not be permitted to be in a live-in arrangement. The court dismissed the argument, saying the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution cannot be denied merely because the petitioners are not of marriageable age. \"The state has a constitutional obligation to safeguard the life and liberty of every individual,\" the judge observed, adding that live-in relationships are not prohibited or criminalised under Indian law. Justice Dhand directed the superintendents of police of Bhilwara and Jodhpur (rural) to verify the facts stated in the petition, assess the threat perception, and ensure necessary protection to the couple if required.

The airline has reportedly asked for relief from some provisions that limit pilot duty hours at night. According to the new aviation rules, DGCA has increased the amount of mandatory rest per week for commercial pilots by 12 hours to 48 hours. In addition, pilots are now only allowed to make two night-time landings per week, down from six under the old rules.

According to a DGCA press release, IndiGo briefed the aviation watchdog on the flight cancellations and provided initial reasons for them, including transitional challenges in implementing the revised Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL) CAR, crew-planning issues, and winter-season operational constraints.

Tom Cotton, who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, as he exited a classified briefing, as per an Associated Press report. At the time of the attack, Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, overseeing coordinated operations between the military's elite special operations units out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace?
