INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction.

Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together. It was not an easy decision, or an easy scheme to devise…not the least because the NEP and the NCF (national curriculum framework) itself talk about three options.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

Elaborating on the educator capacity-building initiatives in the country, the education minister informed that 234 principals and educational administrators have been trained in advanced administrative and academic leadership in Singapore. He said 199 headmasters have honed their strategic and managerial skills at IIM Ahmedabad , and 144 primary teachers have completed an immersive training in Finland so far. He said these teachers, selected on merit, are expected to act as ‘master trainers,’ cascading their acquired knowledge and skills to their peers upon their return, thereby creating a multiplier effect throughout the state’s educational system. “This is not just a training programme.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763903976.407079}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains.

For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do.

Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order. What matters is that you strategically maximize ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/jee-main-2026-right-order-to-answer-jeemains-question-paper-jee-advanced-10361152/", "timestamp": 1763903979.2356944}

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process.

This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion.

As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary.

When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm.

I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better.

The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said. The minister added that the app is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and will encourage skill-based learning while integrating activities under the Fit India initiative.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date. Immigration officials note that not all visa holders are expected to apply immediately for the additional five hours, as some may wait until their next visa renewal or may be nearing the end of their studies.

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete. Germany’s medical qualification, the Staatsexamen is a six-year program conducted in German, requiring at least C1-level proficiency in the language.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra.

The review also recommends cutting the overall volume of exams faced by teenagers by 10 per cent, with the current examination levels seen as “excessive”. “From the fundamentals of reading to the present danger of spotting fake news, as part of our Plan for Change, these landmark reforms will help young people step boldly into the future, with the knowledge to achieve and the skills to thrive as the world around us continues to rapidly evolve,” said Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. “It has been over a decade since the national curriculum was updated, and it’s more crucial than ever that young people are equipped to face the challenges of today, so they can seize the exciting opportunities that life has to offer. “The path to our country’s renewal runs through our schools: they must be an epicentre of the strongest possible foundations of knowledge, and the skills to excel in the modern world,” she said. According to the DfE, primary school-aged children will be taught how to identify misinformation and disinformation, helping them develop the critical thinking needed to challenge what they see and protect them from online harms. They will also learn more about the fundamentals of money, such as mortgages and debt, and also bring in important changes to strengthen children’s reading. “It is essential that every young person finishes their education with the knowledge and skills to move successfully into working life,” said Jane Gratton, Deputy Director of Public Policy at t", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/school-children-in-england-to-learn-about-fake-news-in-curriculum-10349032/", "timestamp": 1763903988.983054}

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

The idea then apparently took on a new form, with the administration reportedly drafting an executive order that would establish an AI Litigation Task Force with a mission to challenge state AI laws through lawsuits. States with contested AI laws would also reportedly be threatened with the loss of federal broadband funding. Now, Reuters reports that the executive order has been put on hold . If signed, the order would probably face significant opposition, including from Republicans who previously criticized the proposed moratorium on state regulation.

He is denying wrongdoing, accusing lenders of misleading the court, and vowing to appeal a ruling that marks a dramatic fall for a onetime poster boy of India’s startup boom. The Delaware bankruptcy judge issued a default judgment after finding that Raveendran had repeatedly ignored court orders and provided “evasive, incomplete” responses regarding about $533 million that Byju’s U.S. unit allegedly transferred in 2022 and never recovered. The judge also cited issues with a separate limited-partnership stake later valued at roughly $540.6 million. The ruling, dated November 20, stems from legal action by lenders seeking to claw back funds linked to the $1.2 billion term loan they extended to the ed-tech startup in 2021. Earlier this year, in April, a group of U.S. lenders led by GLAS Trust sued Raveendran and his wife, Byju’s co-founder Divya Gokulnath, in the Delaware bankruptcy court over the missing $533 million in loan proceeds. The couple denied wrongdoing at the time and accused lenders of attempting a hostile takeover of the company. They later said they planned to pursue a $2.5 billion lawsuit against GLAS Trust and others in India and other jurisdictions, though no such filing has publicly surfaced. This was in addition to the complaint Byju’s filed in the New York Supreme Court challenging the acceleration of the term loan in 2023. The court’s latest order followed a September 29 hearing on the default request, where the judge cited a months-long pattern of noncompliance. The judge noted that Raveendran skipped hearings, missed extended deadlines, and ignored a prior contempt order imposing $10,000 in daily sanctions that remain unpaid.

A new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago , it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation. In 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050. Fast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO 2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040. Today, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time. If the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections? How you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines. When forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time?

While X is not one of the largest social networks in the U.S., it’s still the one to beat within the smaller market of social apps that focus on short, real-time text posts that appear in a vertical feed. This space has seen increased competition since Elon Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it as X in October 2022, as Musk’s changes to the platform’s content moderation policies and the site’s rightward political shift sent some users looking for alternatives. In addition to the growth seen by decentralized, open source networks like Mastodon and Bluesky , other startups launched would-be Twitter rivals like Spill , Post , T2 (Pebble), and Hive .

And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds. Nowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment. For instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.” The app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time. “Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.” Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days. Another notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page.

The shakeup eliminates the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, the Grid Deployment Office, and the Office of Federal Energy Management programs. On the other side of the ledger, the DOE has created a new Office of Fusion and merged geothermal and fossil fuels under the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office. Some of these moves will likely spur legal challenges, E&E News points out , given that at least one office caught up in the reorg, the OCED, was authorized by Congress under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “The authority of Cabinet secretaries to move around major functions and offices is very limited, especially when those offices were established and funded through congressional action. Congress has put tight handcuffs on reorganizations, and plans typically require either congressional approval or the opportunity for congressional review,” Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, told E&E News. The creation of the Office of Fusion was likely spurred to encourage commercialization of the technology. Previously, fusion fell under the Office of Science, which is focused on research rather than commercialization.

Livestreamers who watch SpaceX’s Starbase complex closely caught the explosion in the pre-dawn hours Friday, around 4:00 a.m. local time. Other creators in the area have since captured photos that offer a closer look at the damage. Unlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, according to Ars Technica . SpaceX said in a post on X that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. “The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday. The booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design in October .) It’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. The company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship. That includes demonstrating the ability to transfer fuel to Starship from a “tanker” version of the rocket while in orbit. SpaceX needs to prove that capability to NASA before it can proceed with crewed missions to the moon, which it is reportedly targeting for 2028.

One Democratic commissioner dissented, saying the decision leaves the United States \"less safe\" at a time when threats are increasing.", "content": "The Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 along party lines on Thursday to scrap rules that required U.S. phone and internet giants to meet certain minimum cybersecurity requirements. The FCC’s two Trump-appointed commissioners, chairman Brendan Carr and his Republican colleague Olivia Trusty, voted to withdraw the rules that require telecommunications carriers to “secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.” The Biden administration had adopted these rules prior to leaving office earlier this year . The FCC’s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, dissented. In a statement following the vote, Gomez called the now-overturned rules the “only meaningful effort this agency has advanced” since the discovery of a sweeping campaign by a China-backed hacking group called Salt Typhoon that involved hacking into a raft of U.S. phone and internet companies . The hackers broke into more than 200 telcos, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, during the years-long campaign to conduct broad-scale surveillance of American officials. In some cases, the hackers targeted wiretap systems that the U.S. government previously required telcos to install for law enforcement access. The FCC’s move to change the rules sparked rebuke from senior lawmakers, including Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Peters said he was “disturbed” by the FCC’s effort to roll back “basic cybersecurity safeguards” and warned that doing so will “leave the American people exposed.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the rule change “leaves us without a credible plan” to address the basic security gaps exploited by Salt Typhoon and others. For its part, the NCTA, which represents the telecommunications industry, praised the scrapping of the rules, calling them “prescriptive and counterproductive regulations.” But Gomez warned that while collaboration w", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/despite-chinese-hacks-trumps-fcc-votes-to-scrap-cybersecurity-rules-for-phone-and-internet-companies/", "timestamp": 1763904263.2838433}

Pinterest, however, was excluded, in line with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) rules. Twitch will no longer allow Australians under 16 to create accounts starting December 10, a Twitch spokesperson told TechCrunch. Existing accounts for users under 16 will be deactivated on January 9. Globally, Twitch is open to users 13 and older, and anyone under the legal age of adulthood in their region must have a parent or guardian involved, the spokesperson said. Pinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Australia’s eSafety stated that Twitch is categorized as an “age-restricted social media platform” because the service is built around online social interaction and engagement features like livestreaming. Pinterest, on the other hand, is mainly used for collecting images and ideas, so it isn’t included in the age-restricted rules. Australia has said its underage social media ban, which will go into effect on December 10, will apply to Meta ‘s Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, YouTube (except YouTube Kids and Google Classroom ), Reddit, and the local streaming service, Kick. These platforms will be required to block account access for users under 16, according to a statement by the internet regulator. About a year ago, Australia passed a law banning social media use for children under 16. At the time, major tech companies like Google and Meta called on the government to delay enforcement until the country finished its age-verification trial. The regulator provides a self-assessment tool to help platforms determine if they must follow the SMMA rules.

Helsinki’s annual Slush conference this year showed a venture market that feels like it is on the brink of transformation, one that’s ready for its first trillion-dollar startup. Founders, venture investors and government officials alike acknowledged the hurdles that have traditionally held Europe back from reaching its true scale and potential. For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash. Firms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since shuttered those shops . OMERs, for example, let much of its European team go . Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco . Largely, people think the kinks have been worked out: Multiple venture investors told TechCrunch at Slush that the notion of the market being undercapitalized, or that deeper U.S. pockets aren’t interested, is overblown. One investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London. (Andreessen later closed its office , too, alas.) Though the lure to head to the U.S. remains strong, European companies are also starting to find success in resisting pressure from U.S. investors to move to the Valley to build their companies.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war.

By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need.

Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup.

Mostly what it did was sell out of stock—over and over and over. But of course it did. The Ninja Slushi offers something that feels so rare these days: adult fun. It was the first device that really brought the bar slushie machine into the American home kitchen. It basically just takes whatever flavors you already have on hand and makes it into the kind of boozy slushie that would be sold at the 7-Elevens in heaven. Anyway, it's now on a hefty sale—matching its lowest price for the full-time machine since it first went on sale in July 2024, then sold out almost instantaneously .

I have made cold-brew slushie lattes, mimosa slushies, frosé slushies, daiquiri and margarita slushies, sour-beer slushies, Mike's Hard Mango Lemonade Slushies, and of course slushies made with fruit juice and simple syrup for parties full of children. All things cold and sweet are delicious. The Ninja Slushi was discounted to $300 as recently as October. At the time, this was the lowest I expected to see the price fall this year. Glad to be wrong, I guess. (But note that the smaller, Walmart-exclusive, 72-ounce Ninja Slushi machine is on sale for $250 , a price it's seen multiple times since last year.)

If you knew an intercontinental ballistic missile was heading somewhere in middle America, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead, you'd probably hope that the US government and military would be on top of the situation. At the very least, you'd expect them to know who launched the strike, from where, and how to intercept it. In A House of Dynamite , the most terrifying thing is how much might not be known in such a nightmarish scenario, and how the very systems we think will protect us from nuclear war might not be up to the job. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow ( The Hurt Locker ) and featuring a powerhouse cast including Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts, and Anthony Ramos, this triptych explores the same nightmarish 18 minutes after an unidentified missile is detected from three different perspectives, each chapter likely filling you with mounting existential dread.

It’s not because of my health, or because I dislike the taste of chicken or beef: It’s a lifestyle choice I made because I wanted to reduce my impact on the planet. And yet, twice a day, every day, I lovingly scoop a cup of meat-based kibble into a bowl and set it down for my 50-pound rescue dog, a husky mix named Loki. Until recently, I hadn’t devoted a huge amount of thought to that paradox. Then I read an article in the Associated Press headlined “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The study , led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.” The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions. But mere hours after the AP published its article, its aim had been recast as something else entirely: an attack on people’s furry family members. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one Reddit user wrote. Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals. Goldwert and her fellow researchers watched the reactions unfold with dismay. “If I saw a headline that said, ‘Climate scientists want to take your dogs away,’ I would also fee", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-climate-paradox-of-having-a-dog/", "timestamp": 1763904265.9902117}

Set in late 1800s Japan, Last Samurai Standing follows retired samurai Shujiro Saga (Junichi Okada), who enters the savage \"Kodoku\" tournament in a desperate effort to save his family, struck down by cholera. The problem is, he's one of 292 former samurai aiming to win the ¥100,000 prize, and the only way to progress through the competition is to collect tags from fallen enemies and pass through checkpoints set up by the event's mysterious organizers. It's going to be a bloodbath.

The issue stems from WhatsApp’s discovery feature, which allows someone to enter a person’s phone number to see if they’re on the app. By doing this billions of times—which WhatsApp did not prevent—researchers from the University of Vienna uncovered what they’re calling “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever . Vaping is a major problem in US high schools. But is the solution to spy on students in the bathroom? An investigation by The 74, copublished with WIRED, found that schools around the country are turning to vape detectors in an effort to crack down on nicotine and cannabis consumption on school grounds. Some of the vape detectors go far beyond detecting vapor by including microphones that are surprisingly accurate and revealing. While few defend addiction and drug use, even non-vapers say the added surveillance and the punishments that result go too far. Don’t look now, but that old networking equipment your company hasn’t thought about in years may jump out and bite you.

Designed to sit under your TV as comfortably as it would under a monitor, these are micro PCs —but only because Valve seems shy of branding them consoles . The new Steam Machines are Valve's second attempt at launching a dedicated device to bring the PC into the living room. The first generation Steam Machines launched a decade ago, in November 2015, and while that iteration ultimately flopped , the marketplace in 2025 is much different. The Steam Deck has been a huge success, inspiring a whole fleet of gaming handhelds —with even Xbox joining the party —and PC gaming as a whole is in a much stronger position. So, when the announcement video for this new product family went to great lengths to explain that the new Steam Machine is still a PC and not a console, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. Valve makes and sells PC games; here's a PC to play those games on. Except … c'mon, look at it: in every way that counts, the new Steam Machine effectively is a console—and that's no bad thing. Pop quiz: what defines a games console? Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big screen television. The benefits include fixed specifications meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers knowing that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course). Roughly every half-decade, they might buy a new generation model. What then defines a PC, gaming or otherwise?

Jmail is a website that looks very much like Gmail, except that there is a little hat hanging on the logo and that the profile picture in the top right corner is a grinning Epstein. (Click on it and it says “Hi Jeffrey!”) The inbox lets you click through thousands of emails, formatted to look exactly like a regular message would in your inbox. In the sidebar, you can sort by Inbox, Starred, and Sent. In Gmail, a lower sidebar section reads Labels and separates emails by category. In Jmail, it is a list of people who corresponded with Epstein. The site was created by serial prankster Riley Walz and Luke Igel, cofounder of an AI video editing tool called Kino AI . Igel tells WIRED that he brought the idea to Walz—something Walz confirms—and then the two of them put the website together with Cursor in a single night. Walz revealed Jmail in an X post , writing, “We cloned Gmail, except you're logged in as Epstein and can see his emails.” Jmail is a much more readable way to peruse the huge cache of emails released from the Epstein estate than parsing through tens of thousands of PDFs on a Google Drive. Among its useful features is that it rejiggers Gmail’s starring feature, letting users flag emails they view as important and then ranking them based on how many people do so. By default, the inbox lists the emails in the order of recency; the community starring feature is a way to surfac", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pranksters-recreated-a-working-version-of-jeffrey-epstein-gmail-inbox/", "timestamp": 1763904267.460396}

For the past 10 years REI has shut its doors for Black Friday, suggesting that instead potential customers should get outside and enjoy the world around you.

Both platforms get access to one-touch pairing and the helpful Beats app, while iPhone owners also get the benefits of Hey Siri and Find My Device. The other features are a bit of a mixed bag, with a decent battery life of up to 24 hours with ANC on, or 40 with ANC off, but no auto pause when you take them off, or multi-point pairing beyond Google's Chromebook and Android option. Like most headphones from Beats, the sound profile is decidedly bass-forward, but Apple's ownership has tempered that tendency over the last few years. As a result, this generation is more balanced than previous eras, with our reviewer Ryan Waniata complimenting the expansive sound stage and sharp details. Unfortunately, most Beats headsets don't have any equalizer, and the Studio Pro are no different. For better or worse, you're stuck with how they sound coming out of the box. These at least support high-resolution audio, up to 24-bit/48-kHz, but only in the wired USB-C mode. For the Beats enthusiast looking for an upgrade or a second headset for the gym, these are a solid option at a deeply discounted price. They lack some of the richer and more advanced features found on more expensive headsets, but that may be the right compromise for some folks who just want something simple that works every time.

In China, parents are buying them for children as young as five. Adults want to be able to call their kids and track their location down to a specific building floor. But that’s not why children are clamoring for the devices, specifically ones made by a company called Xiaotiancai, which translates to Little Genius in English. The watches, which launched in 2015 and cost up to $330, are a portal into an elaborate world that blends social engagement with relentless competition. Kids can use the watches to buy snacks at local shops, chat and share videos with friends, play games, and, sure, stay in touch with their families. But the main activity is accumulating as many “likes” as possible on their watch’s profile page. On the extreme end, Chinese media outlets have reported on kids who buy bots to juice their numbers, hack the watches to dox their enemies, and sometimes even find romantic partners. According to tech research firm Counterpoint Research, Little Genius accounts for nearly half of global market share for kids’ smartwatches. Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle. She racked up more than one million likes and became a mini-celebrity on the platform. She said she met all three of her boyfriends through the watch, two of whom she broke up with because they asked her to send erotic photos. High like counts have become a sort of status symbol.

Lucky for you, we’ve been testing the most popular smart bird feeder models, including Netvue’s original Birdfy feeder ($140) and Bird Buddy's Pro ($179) , for over a year—in rain, snow, and heat, and in a yard with persistent squirrels.

This is in conjunction with the standard health and fitness tracking features, plus a more familiar touchscreen interface. However, the downside is the battery life typically lasts a day or two, if not a little more. Fitness trackers , on the other hand, aren't as feature-rich. You typically won't be able to access many other apps. There's the basic ability to read emails and texts, control music playback, or even access tap-to-pay features, but you're generally more restricted.

I was eager to finally outsource some of the cooking by testing two very different robo-chef devices, the Thermomix TM7 and the Posha kitchen robot . Both promise to plan my meals and also do most of the cooking, which sounds pretty good to me. The Thermomix descends from a German device launched in 1968—a time when the best-known robot chef was cartoon Rosie on The Jetsons —that was essentially a blender with a heater.

Some of the criteria we use for evaluating adult headphones simply don't apply for small children (although it's still worth taking a look ). Sound quality matters a little less. We look for ease of use, different colors (Adrienne's daughter won't use anything that's not pink), comfort, and durability. Most headphones that are explicitly for children have a volume-limiting feature called output limitation, which automatically reduces the volume to about 85 decibels. That is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's limit for workplace exposure and about what you'd hear in heavy traffic. However, that's still really high! Even if your child's headphones have volume output limitation, it's a good idea to check on them every so often. To test whether the volume is too high I note whether my kid can hear me when I sit next to them and say, “Time to give your brother a turn.” If she can't hear me, the volume needs to go down.

An at-home nut milk maker, ranging from $25 to over $400, can be a good investment for making plant- and nut-based milks at home. Whether you're vegan like me, vegetarian, lactose intolerant, or just want to cut down on preservatives and additives, a nut milk maker can be a great alternative to buying cow (or other) milk in-store. We've tested some of the best nut and plant milk makers on the market today. These nifty high-tech machines sit on your counter and do all the work for you, giving you supremely fresh, additive-free plant milk. I've tested these nut milk makers with oat, almond, and coconut, and most often use in cereal and coffee. Overall, I've found that they add a fresh nuttiness, especially in coffee, that is missing from the store-bought brands available. Plus, an at-home nut milk maker is a great way to reduce plastic and paper consumption, along with saving money over time. Our reigning champ, the Nama M1 Plant Milk Maker , is the best nut milk maker on the market right now, and the super-simple Chef'n Nut Milk Maker is our favorite budget pick.

His proposal: use :-) and :-( as markers to distinguish jokes from serious comments. While Fahlman describes himself as “the inventor … or at least one of the inventors” of what would later be called the smiley face emoticon , the full story reveals something more interesting than a lone genius moment. The whole episode started three days earlier when computer scientist Neil Swartz posed a physics problem to colleagues on Carnegie Mellon’s “bboard,” which was an early online message board. The discussion thread had been exploring what happens to objects in a free-falling elevator, and Swartz presented a specific scenario involving a lit candle and a drop of mercury. That evening, computer scientist Howard Gayle responded with a facetious message titled “WARNING!” He claimed that an elevator had been “contaminated with mercury” and suffered “some slight fire damage” due to a physics experiment. Despite clarifying posts noting the warning was a joke, some people took it seriously. The incident sparked immediate discussion about how to prevent such misunderstandings and the “flame wars” (heated arguments) that could result from misread intent. “This problem caused some of us to suggest (only half seriously) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously,” Fahlman later wrote in a retrospective post published on his CMU website. “After all, when using text-based online communication, we lack the body language or tone-of-voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone.” On September 17, 1982, the next day after the misunderstanding on the CMU bboard, Swartz made the first concrete proposal: “Maybe we should adopt a convention of putting a star (*) in the subject f", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/a-computer-scientist-invented-the-emoticon-after-his-colleagues-misunderstood-sarcasm/", "timestamp": 1763904269.7853837}

Originally launched as a barebones password manager for the company to bundle alongside NordVPN , there was never much reason to use it. It lacked features, and even with a solid free plan, you could get better functionality elsewhere. Today, however, NordPass is one of the best password managers on the market. It’s still missing some features like Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) storage that help options like 1Password and Proton Pass shoot ahead of the pack, and it could stand to offer more organization. But the core service of storing and autofilling your passwords is excellent, bolstered by additional features like email masking. NordPass has a free plan, which is great to see in a post-LastPass world . I prefer Proton Pass for free password managers, mainly due to the fact that it supports cross-device sync. But NordPass still allows you to store unlimited logins and autofill in your browser or on mobile, and you don’t need to enter a credit card to sign up. Nord Security NordPass Rating: 8/10 The free plan comes with the same backbone as the paid offering, including xChaCha20 encryption and biometric authentication. It technically supports cross-device sync, too, but it’s a little strange. You can access your vault from any device, but unlocking your vault on one device will log you out on another. You can only have one device authenticated at a time. In addition to extra convenience across devices, the Premium plan has a slew of features, including breach monitoring, a password health dashboard, support for attachment and document storage, sharing capabilities, and email masking. Email masking is one of the biggest features that drew me toward Proton Pass for my personal use—it hides your real email address—and I love that it's here in NordPass.

The RAISE Act passed through New York’s legislature in June, and is due to be signed or vetoed by governor Kathy Hochul before the end of the year. It’s one of a handful of state AI safety bills across the country that attempt to regulate AI developers—even as the Trump administration readies an executive order aimed at thwarting state-level AI laws. This effort is what landed Bores squarely in the crosshairs of Leading the Future. In addition to backing from venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, the recently formed PAC is also funded by OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale. Andreessen Horowitz declined WIRED’s request for comment. Brockman and Lonsdale did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. Leading the Future plans to spend millions of dollars to kill Bores’ bid for Congress. “Assemblyman Bores has advanced exactly the type of ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s, ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation,” said the PAC’s leaders, Zac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, in a statement to WIRED.

To combat “con crud,” New Zealand's premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees. To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO 2 monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids’ areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. \"It’s ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry,\" the organizers wrote on the convention’s website. \"What they did is fantastic,\" Jeff Moss, founder of the Defcon and Black Hat security conferences, told WIRED. \"CO 2 is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available. Kawaiicon building something to do this is the true spirit of hacking.\" Elevated levels of CO 2 lead to reduced cognitive ability and facilitate transmission of airborne viruses, which can linger in poorly ventilated spaces for hours. The more CO 2 in the air, the more virus-friendly the air becomes , making CO 2 data a handy proxy for tracing pathogens. In fact, the Australian Academy of Science described the pollution in indoor air as “someone else’s breath backwash.” Kawaiicon organizers faced running a large infosec event during a measles outbreak, as well as constantly rolling waves of Covid-19, influenza, and RSV. It’s a familiar pain point for conference organizers frustrated by massive gaps in public health—and lack of control over their venue’s clean air standards. \"In general, the Michael Fowler venue has a single HVAC system, and uses Farr 30/30 filters with a rating of MERV-8,” Kawaiicon organizers explained, referencing the filtration choices in the space where the convention was held.

That’s what eCoffee Energyband, a Chinese gadget that sells for just over $100, is claiming to do. First released in late 2023, the product is a lightweight wearable with two electrode pads that sit against the inner wrist. WAT Medical , a Canadian company with a Chinese subsidiary making and marketing the device, claims the mild electrical signals sent by the wristband can keep wearers alert by stimulating nerves in the brain. The effect is supposedly about the same as a cup of coffee, minus the risk of caffeine addiction. The only side effect is that your hand could feel numb from the tip of the finger to the inner wrist, the company says, so the makers suggest that it only be worn for three hours a day, and users can switch which wrists they put it on. The gadget would likely have stayed in relative obscurity if the company that makes it had not attended a recent Chinese trade show, whereafter it suddenly went viral. “The purpose of inventing this eCoffee Energyband is not to replace coffee. Coffee is great, but it’s not always suitable for the afternoon or evening. But we still have the need to feel refreshed during those times,” Xu Haojie, the company’s director of operations, told Chinese state media Xinhua at the trade show. After wearing it, the Xinhua reporter said, “It feels like I’m being gently tapped. I can feel the electric pulse.” It immediately became a sensation online. On Chinese ecommerce websites, including JD and Taobao, the device appears to be sold out as of now, with hundreds of mixed reviews from buyers. The device is also sold and shipped to markets around the world. The website lists its normal price at $130, with a holiday promotion going on right now that knocks 30 percent off the price.

These three brews offer anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial kickbacks that ease congestion, soothe throat irritation, and shore up your immune defenses without pharmaceutical side effects.​", "content": "A stubborn cough or runny nose doesn't always need pills. Herbal teas harness plant compounds that calm inflammation, thin mucus, and fortify immunity. Steep, sip, and let these remedies do their work steadily over days. These won't cure overnight, but they're comforting and genuinely helpful. Slice fresh ginger root, boil it for ten minutes, strain, then add honey and lemon. Ginger's bioactive compounds reduce throat swelling and open clogged nasal passages. Drink twice daily. It tastes peppery, warms you up, and genuinely eases that scratchy feeling that makes coughing worse. Heat milk (dairy or plant-based), stir in half a teaspoon turmeric powder, add honey after cooling slightly. Turmeric contains curcumin, a potent anti-inflammatory compound that soothes irritated respiratory passages. Drink before bed. The creamy base coats your throat and supports deeper healing during sleep cycles. Steep eight to ten fresh holy basil leaves in hot water for five to seven minutes. Tulsi, revered in Ayurveda, acts as both antimicrobial and adaptogenic, meaning it steadies your body's stress response while fighting infection. It tastes slightly peppery and clears congestion remarkably well without tasting medicinal. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

{"id": "90263b7d0eadaef0cf41d9be2c49c8cc", "title": "5 fibre-rich dinners for balanced glucose level and blood sugar control", "summary": "", "content": "Fibre slows carbohydrate digestion, letting your body absorb sugar gradually instead of in one spike. Add protein to any meal and you'll genuinely feel fuller longer. These recipes do exactly that without fussing around with impossible ingredients. Kidney beans are protein powerhouses. Mix them into a simple curry with tomatoes, onions, and spices. Pair with almond flour rotis instead of regular wheat. The combination tackles insulin sensitivity from two angles, preventing sharp glucose jumps. Daliya (broken wheat) absorbs less water than rice, making it inherently lower on the glycaemic index. Toss in carrots, peas, and beans. This humble one-pot meal delivers sustained energy without the afternoon slump that white rice causes. Chickpeas are essentially fibre wrapped in protein. Fenugreek leaves add bitter compounds that genuinely help with glucose metabolism. Cook them together with minimal oil and serve with a small helping of millet roti for the complete metabolic effect. Quinoa contains all nine essential amino acids, making it rare among plant foods. Mix with mixed vegetables and cook like regular khichdi. The combination creates a complete meal that stabilises blood sugar without needing extra protein sources. Barley has more fibre than most grains and contains beta-glucan, which actively improves cholesterol alongside blood glucose control. Roast your vegetables separately for texture. This is genuinely satisfying despite being exceptionally gentle on pancreas function. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

It was weird. It was expensive. And it sparked the revolution we carry in our pockets today. It was IBM Simon/ The magic was simple: Simon combined a phone with what folks called a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)—basically a mini computer that fit in your hand. Nobody had done that before. It was the first of its kind. Simon had something rare for 1992: a monochrome touchscreen display. You could tap with your finger or use a stylus to navigate. Revolutionary. No buttons meant more screen space than competitors. Address book, calendar, calculator, world clock, notepad, sketch pad, email, faxing. Tasks that once meant carrying five different devices now lived in one. Convenience redefined in black and white pixels. Simon ran on a tweaked DOS operating system, (disk-based operating system) , the backbone of desktop computers back then. This wasn't just a phone masquerading as smart; it genuinely borrowed computing architecture to stay nimble. Weighing 1.1 pounds, Simon was clunky. Heavy. Honestly, it looked like a brick someone dropped. Modern phones are featherweight by comparison, but back then, this felt like a miracle squeezed into something portable. One hour. That's all the battery gave you. An hour of calls, calendar checks, sketching. Today's phones last a full day. Back then, that one-hour lifeline felt cruel. Business users got frustrated fast. August 1994: Simon hit shelves via BellSouth for around 899 dollars with a two-year contract. In today's money, that's over 1,900 dollars. Expensive gamble for unproven technology no one truly understood yet. Only 50,000 sold before Simon vanished after six months. High cost plus that dreadful battery life meant only the tech-obsessed and ultra-wealthy kept one. Market rejection stung, but the seed was planted. Simon didn't survive, but its DNA lived on.

Edwin Hubble had just shown the world that those fuzzy nebula patches weren't mist inside our galaxy. They were entire galaxies themselves, sitting unfathomably far out in the void. It's the moment everything changed. Scientists genuinely thought the Milky Way was it. The whole show. Everything visible, everything that mattered. Spiral nebulae looked like clouds to them—gas and dust swirling around inside our own cosmic neighborhood. Nobody suspected they were separate universes teeming with billions of stars. The idea would've sounded outlandish. Mount Wilson's 100-inch Hooker was cutting-edge weaponry for astronomy then. Hubble used it to spot Cepheid variable stars, a specific type that blinks predictably. By measuring their brightness and rhythm, he calculated distances. Andromeda wasn't close. It was incomprehensibly, staggeringly far. A different island altogether. That fuzzy patch people had studied for centuries wasn't misty gas around us. It was two trillion stars arranged in a spiral, orbiting a supermassive black hole, drifting 2.5 million light-years away. Andromeda was kin to the Milky Way but utterly, irrevocably separate. We had a cosmic neighbor. Humanity had just been evicted from the center of everything. We weren't the universe's whole story anymore. Suddenly there were other island universes out there, cold and indifferent, full of their own mysteries. It felt smaller and larger simultaneously. The ground beneath human certainty shifted. Hubble's work didn't just expand the map. It let scientists ask new questions. If other galaxies exist, are they moving? How far does the universe actually stretch? What's its shape? These questions kicked off the entire field of modern cosmology. Hubble himself would spend the next decade answering them. Within a few years, Hubble noticed those distant galaxies were moving away from us.

Pixar's audacious gamble paid off spectacularly, launching an era where pixels became the primary medium for storytelling dreams. Ed Catmull and Steve Jobs acquired the Graphics Group from George Lucas, known for the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, in 1986, establishing Pixar as an independent entity. Initially focused on hardware, the company pivoted toward animation after financial headwinds. Tom Hanks as Woody confronts his obsolescence when Buzz Lightyear arrives, forcing a reluctant friendship through wild misadventures. Released November 22, 1995, it grossed approximately 375 million dollars globally, ranking as the year's second-highest grossing film and fundamentally altering animation's trajectory forever. Adjusted for re-releases, it accumulated over 401 million dollars, validating computer animation's commercial viability decisively. Woody faces toy kidnapping when a collector targets him, requiring rescue from fellow toys. Earning 246 million dollars worldwide, this installment demonstrated sequels could match originals. The franchise's trajectory proved sustainable, contradicting skeptics who doubted CGI animation's staying power and market appeal. Facing daycare relocation instead of attic storage, toys confront abandonment fears reflecting protagonist Andy's college transition. This film grossed 415 million dollars globally, resonating across generations. Its thematic sophistication proved animation transcended juvenile audiences, reaching emotional depths comparable to live-action cinema. Forky's introduction throws Woody's identity into question as existential themes deepen. Grossing over 1 billion dollars worldwide, this became animation's highest-grossing installment. The franchise's sustained cultural relevance across 24 years d", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/toy-storys-first-ever-premiere-and-how-steve-jobs-pixar-revolutionized-the-animation-industry-with-cgi/slideshow/125518627.cms", "timestamp": 1763904301.6849964}

Freddie Mercury, the legendary Queen frontman who'd conquered the world with Bohemian Rhapsody and electrifying performances, publicly confirmed his Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome diagnosis just twenty-four hours before he died from a respiratory illness triggered by the disease that had haunted him for years. Mercury’s press office issued his statement just after midnight on November 23. Through a publicist, Freddie spoke: \"I wish to confirm that I have been tested Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive and have AIDS.\" HIV is the virus that weakens the immune system. AIDS is the late stage when the body cannot fight infections well. Friends hoped his statement would end tabloid speculation and reduce stigma while bringing attention to the epidemic.​ Exactly one day later, his lungs betrayed him. Freddie died at 6:48 p.m. on November 24, 1991. The official cause was bronchial pneumonia due to AIDS. At his Kensington home, Garden Lodge, he surrendered peacefully. The flamboyant voice that could hold twenty thousand people silent went quiet forever. Born Farrokh Bulsara in Stone Town, Zanzibar, to a Parsi family, he studied in India and later moved to England after unrest in 1964. He grew up with piano lessons and school bands before forming Queen in London.​ After moving to England, he joined local bands, then teamed with Brian May and Roger Taylor to form Queen. Their layered vocals, theatrical shows, and studio innovation defined a new arena rock sound in the 1970s.​ Queen scored multiple UK number ones and best‑selling albums. Their singles topped charts for weeks, with “Bohemian Rhapsody” achieving an unprecedented UK run in 1975.​ Recorded across five studios with about 180 vocal overdubs, the song pushed analog tape to its limits. It topped charts worldwide and became one of rock’s most celebrated recordings.

The clarification followed an article published by Islamabad's Geo TV on November 21, which claimed that a French naval commander had affirmed Pakistan's air superiority and stated that Indian Rafale jets were shot down during border skirmishes. The Navy said the report not only misquoted French officers but even published the wrong name, referring to the officer as \"Jacques Launay\" instead of his real name, Captain Yvan Launay. In a statement released on its official X account, the Marine Nationale said all the remarks attributed to Captain Launay were fabricated. \"These statements were attributed to Captain Launay, who never gave his consent for any form of publication. The article contains extensive misinformation and disinformation,\" it said. The disputed article had sensationally claimed that a French commander told an Indo-Pacific conference that the Pakistan Air Force performed \"much better\" during the May 6-7 confrontation involving over 140 fighter jets. It also alleged that he confirmed that Indian Rafales were shot down and linked the outcome to supposed Chinese support. The French Navy said none of this was true.  According to the Navy, Captain Launay's actual role is limited to commanding the naval air station at Landivisiau, where Rafale Marine aircraft are stationed, contrary to the Pakistani portrayal of him as a senior operational authority involved in the India-Pakistan conflict. His presentation at the conference, France said, was purely technical: he described the missions of the Rafale Marine, the carrier strike group concept, and general challenges pilots face in high-intensity air combat.

The TV personality from Hunan suffered a sudden illness that changed her life. Liang joined Hunan TV in 2001 and had a promising future. But, only four months into the job, she collapsed backstage. She later came to know that she had a rare spinal cord vascular malformation. The condition ruptured and compressed her central nervous system. It left her paralysed from the chest down at age 22. Even though she regained movement in her upper limbs after surgery , she was put in a wheelchair. Liang initially struggled with anger and frustration during her hospital stay. She felt her career and future had been taken away. Her perspective gradually shifted when she encountered kindness from strangers. She started spreading positivity to other patients. She later met renowned writer Shi Tiesheng, who was also paralysed young. Yet, he inspired millions with his optimistic work. Liang rebuilt her confidence and identity. Eventually, she returned to television as a wheelchair anchor. Now, she has become a symbol of resilience in China. “We are unaware of the despair we will encounter when we are young. The only thing we can do is read and think, so that we can fight the despair when we encounter it,” the South China Morning Post quoted Shi as telling her. Liang Yi rebuilt her career through strong will and discipline. In 2011, she studied intensely for three months and was admitted to a master’s program in broadcasting and hosting at the Communication University of China. The following year, she returned to Hunan TV and made her historic comeback on screen as a wheelchair anchor. For over 10 years, she has hosted TV and radio shows, written books, and participated in events to motivate people with disabilities. Liang leaves home three hours early for recordings even though the studio is only 20 minutes away. She uses a cushion to support her back.

The man has demanded strict legal action against “Vijay Guruji,” the owner of Vijayalaxmi Ayurvedic Shop. An FIR was filed on Saturday under multiple sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), and the investigation is ongoing.  As per the FIR, the victim started facing sexual health issues after his marriage in 2023 and was receiving treatment at a multi-speciality hospital in Kengeri. Earlier in May, the man came across the advertisement, “quick solutions for sexual problems”. He met a man who directed him to \"Vijay Guruji,\" claiming he could provide a cure. Guruji allegedly examined the victim and recommended an Ayurvedic medicine called Devaraj Booti, claiming it was only available at his store and cost ₹ 1,60,000 per gram. The victim was instructed to pay in cash, avoiding online transactions. Trusting the healer, the victim purchased the medicine and was later given another product, Bhavan Booti oil, priced at ₹ 76,000 per gram. Over the following weeks, he spent ₹ 17 lakh on various medicines as directed by Guruji.  According to the FIR, Guruji later insisted that the victim needed to buy more Devaraj Booti, warning that the previous treatment wouldn't work otherwise. To comply, the victim took a ₹ 20 lakh loan from the bank to buy 18 grams of the medicine.

Carney added that consensus reached by leaders at the G20 meeting this weekend is significant, even without US participation, as per the report. According to the report, Donald Trump said that US would stay away from this year's G20 meeting repeating a debunked claim that White Afrikaner farmers in South Africa are being subjected to a genocide. Washington said only a chairman’s summary could be released from the gathering in the absence of the US.

The DJ, who goes by the name ‘Krispie Kristina’, asserted that they were “choking on power” and even told them to “go to their country”. The woman further stated that the police officers who stopped them at midnight did not even have a “female officer” with them. According to an Indian Express report, the Goa Police said they have contacted the complainant and that a probe has been initiated. In a post on Instagram , Kristina detailed the incident and wrote: “From the very beginning he was very very rude. It was immediately obvious that this wasn’t his first time. He was already choking on his power and impunity. And from many friends I have heard that it is a normal situation there,” she said in a post on social media. She said the police officer “spoke very aggressively, rudely and started saying ‘Go to your country, you’re not in your country’.” “When we showed him our driver’s license, he said, ‘okay go’. And when my friend started to drive away, he called her a ‘bitch’ and said ‘fuck off’,” she claimed. “Can you imagine? In a tourist state, a state that functions only thanks to tourists, the police allow themselves to be so lawless and literally kick tourists out. It’s a shame we didn’t film it, but I was afraid to even take out my phone because he was so aggressive,” she said.

Full details here.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "More than 300 students and teachers were abducted from a Nigerian school in one of the country's largest mass kidnappings, a Christian group said on Saturday, adding to growing concerns about security in Africa's most populous nation. The early Friday raid on St Mary's co-education school in Niger state, western Nigeria, followed another attack just days earlier, when gunmen stormed a secondary school in neighbouring Kebbi state and abducted 25 girls. It was earlier reported by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) that 227 people have been seized in the attack, but a subsequent “verification exercise” concluded that 303 students and 12 teachers were kidnapped. The missing boys and girls, who were aged between eight and 18 years, make up almost half of St Mary's total student population of 629, AFP reported. The Nigerian government has not yet commented on the exact number of students and teachers abducted from the school. However, Niger state governor Mohammed Umar Bago said on Saturday that the intelligence department and police are conducting a “head count.” Governor Bago immediately ordered the closure of all schools in Niger state, with the government now focusing on rescuing the students and teachers. Nearby states have also implemented similar precautionary measures. Furthermore, the national education ministry has also mandated the shutdown of 47 boarding secondary schools across the country. In a significant sign of the crisis's gravity, President Bola Tinubu cancelled his international engagements, including his plans to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg, to focus on the domestic security situation. The latest wave of abductions, including a separate assault on a church that left two people dead and dozens kidnapped, comes after US President Donald Trump threatened military action over what he described as the killing of Christians by radical Islamists in Nigeria.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture.

This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart.
