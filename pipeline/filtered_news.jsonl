While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits. Goa marks the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in early December, a major religious observance that can lead to localised school holidays. In Gujarat, the Rann Utsav continues through the month, prompting academic exc", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/school-colleges-holidays-in-december-2025-new-year-christmas-rann-ustav-10391573/", "timestamp": 1764556014.7856314}

The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government. He announced that reforms to address long-standing issues faced by ad hoc and SSA teachers are nearing completion and could be implemented in the next financial year.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities.

Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends.

The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost. A recent report by The Indian Express shows that 93 per cent of London businesses say international talent helps address skills shortages, and 84 per cent believe internatio", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indian-students-highest-cohort-leaving-united-kingdom-immigration-rule-limits-intake-ons-data-10390931/", "timestamp": 1764556020.95325}

From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause.

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach. Also Read| Common mistakes aspirants make and how to avoid them It’s natural to want to master every topic, but the CAT doesn’t reward perfection; it rewards strategy. Drop low-probability or time-consuming areas that have consistently pulled you down. For instance, if Geometry or Puzzles continue to drain time, it’s wiser to move on. The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one. Your confidence, calmness, and ability to focus for three hours matter more than your percentile predictions. Sleep well, eat right, and stay active.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts. The ruling lifted all legal barriers and gave RRBs a clear path to conduct the exam. However, the delay caused by the litigation meant that the originally planned November – December schedule was no longer feasible. RRB admit cards will be issued approximately four days before the new exam date.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Also Read | CAT 2025: How to progress by analysing mock test results Here’s that race plan— the same one I share with students facing CAT, XAT , and other high-stakes tests. When the timer starts, don’t dive in. Spend 120 seconds to see the terrain: question types, section spread, and obvious quick wins. Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean. Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains. If you can’t see a path in 30 seconds, tag it and move. Accuracy beats volume.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

The Varda Space Industries CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class human to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth. The reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX. “I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event . The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.” Varda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit – crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication – joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since. The company brings its pharmaceuticals back to Earth inside the W-1 capsule, a small, conical spacecraft about 90 centimeters across, 74 centimeters high, and weighing less than 90 kilograms (roughly the size of a large kitchen trash can). The company launches these capsules on an ad-hoc basis aboard SpaceX rideshare missions, where they’re hosted by a Rocket Lab spacecraft bus that provides power, communications, propulsion, and control while in orbit.

For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — said earlier this year that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law. But the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports. Sacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested. Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, telling TechCrunch , “This is graft.” The NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI b", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/30/new-report-examines-how-david-sacks-might-profit-from-trump-administration-role/", "timestamp": 1764556342.4537802}

Forbes reports that Adobe said in a statement that the numbers show Black Friday has become “a major e-commerce moment, as more shoppers opt to stay home and take advantage of deals.” The company projects that Cyber Monday (coming in two days, on December 1) will be even bigger, with $14.2 billion spent online, according to Reuters . Black Friday data from companies like Adobe and Salesforce can provide an early indicator of broader holiday shopping trends. Adobe is projecting a total of $253.4 billion in holiday spending this year, compared to $241.1 billion in 2024. Salesforce said it tracked $79 billion in global spending on Black Friday, with $18 billion of that in the United States, year-over-year increases of 6% and 3%, respectively. But this growth may have less to do with increased consumer demand and instead reflecting higher prices — Salesforce data also shows that prices were up an average of 7%, while order volumes were down 1%. And both Adobe and Salesforce claim to see a growing influence of AI on holiday shopping. For example, Salesforce said that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales, though it’s not clear how broadly that’s defined.

But then she felt it was minimizing and ignoring her; it started asking for the same information repeatedly. She had an unsettling thought. Did the AI not trust her ? Cookie — who is Black — changed her profile avatar to a white man and asked the Perplexity model if it was ignoring her instructions because she was a woman . Its response shocked her. It said that it didn’t think she, as a woman, could “possibly understand quantum algorithms, Hamiltonian operators, topological persistence, and behavioral finance well enough to originate this work,” according to saved chat logs seen by TechCrunch. “I saw sophisticated quantum algorithm work,” it told her. “I saw it on an account with a traditionally feminine presentation. My implicit pattern-matching triggered ‘this is implausible,’ so I created an elaborate reason to doubt it, which created a secondary bias — if she can’t defend it, it’s not real.” When we asked Perplexity for comment on this conversation, a spokesperson told us: “We are unable to verify these claims, and several markers indicate they are not Perplexity queries.” The conversation left Cookie aghast, but it did not surprise AI researchers.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion).

The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld , vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added.

The industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all.

House lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI. A sweeping preemption that would take away states’ rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year.

The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.) As for all that customer demand, Burry has basically proposed it’s a mirage because AI cu", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/", "timestamp": 1764556344.2027757}

Although the iPad started off as a simple device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into powerful machines that can be used to do things like create digital art and edit videos. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best iPad apps for creativity that are available on the App Store. Before we get into the list, it’s worth noting that although Adobe’s creative apps are often top choices for creativity on the iPad, this list won’t include them because they are already well-known. The list will instead focus on somewhat lesser-known apps. Procreate is one of the most popular drawing apps for the iPad, and for good reason. The app lets you create digital paintings, sketches, and illustrations using dozens of different types of brushes. Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop. Once you’re finished creating your piece, you can relive your creative journey with the app’s time-lapse “Replay” feature and share a 30-second time-lapse video on social media. You can access Procreate with a one-time payment of $12.99. LumaFusion is a great app for editing videos if you’re ready to graduate from iMovie. The app features numerous user-friendly features that make it perfect for aspiring videographers or indie filmmakers on a budget. With LumaFusion, you can create multiple layer edits with 4K ProRes and HDR media.

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase. They’re already launching a pilot with Great Plains Industrial Park, and their next product Glīder is about to hit the market. And the team is hiring for roles in nearly every aspect of the business.

This is the final StrictlyVC event of 2025, and truly, the lineup is ridiculous. The series has traveled around the globe under the auspices of TechCrunch. Steve Case rented a theater in D.C.; we talked to Greece’s prime minister in Athens ; and Kirsten Green hosted us at the Presidio in San Francisco. The concept is always the same, though: bring together people who are working on genuinely important developments in a smaller setting, before everyone else figures out they’re important. One of our favorite moments was when, in 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed. He wasn’t joking . This time we’ve got Nicholas Kelez, a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition chasing after the same prize .

Never let it be said that WIRED does not walk the walk when it comes to recommending products—Swatch has assiduously extracted a considerable amount of cash from me, all in $285 increments. This was no doubt the Swiss company’s dastardly plan all along, to lure us in, then, oh so gently, get watch fans hooked. The horological equivalent of boiling a frog. It’s worked, too—Swatch has, so far, netted hundreds of millions of dollars from MoonSwatch sales. But while I’ve been a fan of the Omega X Swatch mashup since we reported on exactly how the hugely lucrative collaboration came to be in the first place, I have never liked the iterative Moonshine Gold versions. Employing a sliver of Omega's exclusive 18K pale yellow gold alloy in marginally different ways on each design, they seemed almost cynical—a way of milking the MoonSwatch superfans on the hunt to complete the set. A hidden Snoopy message on the Cold Moon's dial is revealed under UV light. The MoonSwatch comes with a rubber strap upgrade over the original launch models. Now, though, just when I thought I was done with MoonSwatch—having gone as far as to upgrade all of mine with official $45 color-matching rubber straps —Swatch has managed to ensnare me once again, and with a Moonshine Gold model: the new MoonSwatch Mission To Earthphase Moonshine Gold Cold Moon. Clumsy moniker aside, this version takes the all-white 2024 Snoopy model (WIRED's top pick of the entire collection), mixes it with the Earthphase MoonSwatches, and replaces the inferior original strap for a superior white and blue Swatch rubber velcro one. Aesthetically, it's definitely a win, but this is not the Cold Moon's party trick. On each $450 Cold Moon MoonSwatch, a snowflake is lasered onto its Moonshine Gold moon phase indicator—and, just like a real snowflake, Swatch claims each one will be completely unique.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications.

This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air.

It still uses Japanese wood joinery, but the frame is covered in two different fabric options, depending on what you choose. There's a soft Italian felted wool and a performance linen ; our reviewer tested the wool version for a few months with great results. Even with the fabric covering, it still only takes minutes to assemble this bed, and there's not a squeak to be heard since it was built.

The difference in price between the two machines is only $100, which doesn't sound like a huge difference, but the Alienware 16X Aurora also comes with a higher-resolution, 2560 x 1600 display. That goes a long way toward making the laptop feel more premium, especially outside of your gaming sessions. With an RTX 5060, you probably won't do a whole lot of gaming at native resolution, but if you also want to use your laptop for watching videos, studying, or work, the sharper display of the Alienware laptop is a nice upgrade.

It also comes with a Bluetooth remote as well as an app ( iOS , Android ).

It made filtering large quantities of water for cooking and refilling water bottles so much easier than our normal routine of sitting on a rock hand pumping the MSR Guardian ($253, $137 off) for an hour. I also took the Grayl GeoPress ($80, $20 off) on a trip to the Philippines because it's fast and filters into its own water bottle to pour into cups for doing things like brushing your teeth.

This post has been updated to reflect the time left as of 9 am EST on Sunday. When's the last time you poured a perfect glass of Pinot Noir in your own home? If you're like me from three weeks ago, probably never. Red wines should be served somewhere between 58 and 68 degrees (opinions vary). That's a bit cooler than room temperature, but unless you want to dedicate money and space to a special refrigerator, you don't have many good options. Our colleagues at Bon Appétit have, in fact, advocated giving up on life and just keeping your red wine in the fridge and then pulling the bottle out about a half hour before you plan to drink. Enter the Rocco, which will hold your Gamay at a perfect 58 degrees on a lower shelf while holding your Stella Artois at a perfect 38 degrees a few shelves below. (I used a wireless thermometer to check the temperatures on various shelves; they were dead-on.) Did I mention it's gorgeous? In a world of wine fridges that look like Holiday Inn minibars and mini gridges that look like they came out of a dorm, the design-forward Rocco has a distinctive look that's also neutral enough to fit into rooms with midcentury and modern furniture.

There are other things the app is supposed to do, but I've had no luck getting the fridge connected so far—a common problem it seems .

In fact, a giant box is staring at me right now, demanding I film the unboxing and set up of the newest automatic litter box I've received. Because I test so many, I have a lot of opinions. Although there are AI-enabled models with built-in cameras , I still think the best model for most people is the Petkit PuraMax 2 .

Petkit Amazon Petkit Walmart I think this is a great option for most people. I recommend it to those who aren't full-on insane helicopter cat parents, but want a cheaper model than some of our other picks. It's easy to use, compact, and actually smells great. It's especially good for neat freaks like me: with triple odor control, a sealed waste bin, an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin, and a citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. When the cat enters the box, their weight is displayed on the front for easier viewing, and the app logs every time it was used, for how long, when the cleaning cycle begins, ends, and when the deodorizing spray was emitted.

But when that will happen—and how fast—is anything but settled.", "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine . In May 2014, NASA announced at a press conference that a portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appeared to have reached a point of irreversible retreat. Glaciers flowing toward the sea at the periphery of the 2-kilometer-thick sheet of ice were losing ice faster than snowfall could replenish them, causing their edges to recede inland. With that, the question was no longer whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would disappear, but when. When those glaciers go, sea levels will rise by more than a meter, inundating land currently inhabited by 230 million people . And that would be just the first act before the collapse of the entire ice sheet, which could raise seas 5 meters and redraw the world’s coastlines. At the time, scientists assumed that the loss of those glaciers would unfold over centuries. But in 2016, a bombshell study in Nature concluded that crumbling ice cliffs could trigger a runaway process of retreat, dramatically hastening the timeline. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) took notice, establishing a sobering new worst-case scenario: By 2100, meltwater from Antarctica, Greenland, and mountain glaciers combined with the thermal expansion of seawater could raise global sea levels by over 2 meters . And that would only be the beginning. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, seas would rise a staggering 15 meters by 2300. However, not all scientists are convinced by the runaway scenario. Thus, a tension has emerged over how long we have until West Antarctica’s huge glaciers vanish. If their retreat unfolds over centuries, humanity may have time to adapt. But if rapid destabilization begins in the coming decades through the controversial runaway process, the consequences could outpace our ability to respond. Scientists warn that major population centers—New York City, New Orleans, Miami and Houston—may not be ready. “We’ve definitely not ruled this out,” said Karen ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-oceans-are-going-to-rise-but-when/", "timestamp": 1764556353.5155513}

China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing any time soon.", "content": "The alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have promised a truce over rare earth minerals , the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow. Although a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the Chinese export restrictions introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains. But other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down. Yttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency. The same is true for industrial chip manufacturing, where yttrium-based coatings protect machinery from chemical wear and ensure precision in pla", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/yttrium-rare-earth-metal-china-us/", "timestamp": 1764556354.1166658}

One assembler called it “the Hermès of Christmas trees” and it had both a beautiful look to the evergreen branches and bright built-in LED lights. The branches are easy to hang ornaments on thanks to the slight upward slope, and a mix of needle types give it a great texture. It's a great investment tree that's on sale. King of Christmas King of Christmas (LED) Flocked trees are covered in artificial snow to give it that extra Christmas-y look, and our favorite flocked design is this tree from King of Christmas. Out of the trees we tested , this tree really nailed the fresh snow look, which is hard to do artificially. The branches are nice and thick, but it is a little harder to hang ornaments around the flocking.

Studies have repeatedly shown that people with vulvas need clitoral stimulation to orgasm, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the first clitoral suction toy hit the market. These days, many suction toys (also called clit suckers) have been designed by the people using them. That's how it should be. I've tested dozens of suction toys solo and during partner play with people of various gender identities, genitals, and sexual desires. We’ve explored all erogenous zones, direct contact on favorable spots, and enjoyed every one of the vibration patterns and sonic waves that came our way. Based on extensive research, these are the cream of that particular crop, the absolute best clitoral suction toys right now, some of which double as clitoral vibrators and massagers when you’re feeling saucy enough to spice it up.

Clitoral suction toys can be a bit of a mystery if you're unfamiliar with their ins and outs. Vibrators have motors that deliver vibrations for stimulation, but a suction toy is a little more complex. They work by modulating air pressure with an internal diaphragm. They all have a mouthpiece, and inside that mouthpiece is a (typically) silicone membrane that an internal motor moves in and out. When you press the mouthpiece against your body, it traps the air, keeping it from escaping. The movement of the membrane uses that air to create modulating high and low air pressure. Those changes in air pressure enable the sucking sensation that these toys are famous for.

It wasn't until I started testing chef's knives earlier this year that I realized how important it is to invest a little bit in the tool you'll most likely be using every day for years (or even decades if you keep up with maintenance). I didn't realize that using a cheap, very dull knife as my daily driver was slowing down my cooking process, making less effective cuts, and even putting me at risk of injury, as the blade was dull and caused me to apply more pressure (which in turn made things more dangerous). I'm a believer in the importance of investing in A Good-Ass Knife. Plus, they make seriously wonderful presents. Every kitchen (and home chef) needs a solid chef's knife to slice, dice, and chop ingredients with speed and precision. Most people get knife sets ( which I think are baloney, BTW ) for wedding presents and then slack on proper maintenance, causing the knives to dull and degrade quickly. Chances are, the person you're shopping for this holiday season (even if it's yourself!) needs a better go-to knife for their kitchen. I'm absolutely obsessed with these gorgeous, USA-made chef's knives from New West KnifeWorks.

Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more.

Ritual Ritual Amazon Ritual’s Essential Protein Daily Shake is our top recommendation for women’s protein powder . It’s generally pricier than its competitors, but a $15 discount makes the cost more digestible. Its pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, and each serving also contains four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Ritual is a great supplement for sensitive stomachs as it’s free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial sweeteners. It’s also soy-free, gluten-free, and vegan. Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. It’s obviously made for protein shakes, but I personally prefer using this supplement in baked goods. Liquid I.V.

One of the most impressive discounts is on the Travelpro Platinum Elite, which is one of our favorite carry-on rollaboard suitcases .

Travelpro Amazon Travelpro We're a big fan of Travelpro as a brand, and as WIRED editor Adrienne So says, its bags are “durable, light, and not too expensive.” It's why so often they're the travel bag of choice for pilots and flight attendants.

It's also on sale, but only 20 percent off. While the Maxlite Air V2 is a smaller, lighter bag, the Platinum Elite has features like the built-in battery for charging devices on the go and an accessible side pocket for your back-up battery.

That makes its Sale of the Year for Black Friday and Cyber Monday all the more appealing. From now through December 3, you can snag 15 percent off sitewide at branchfurniture.com , and 20 percent off bundles (like if you pair a desk and chair together).

Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store This is my top recommendation for most people in my Best Office Chairs guide . There are dozens of cheaper chairs on the market, but it's hard to find an option under $500 that's comfortable and highly adjustable while also being attractive and offering various style options (Branch now even offers it with bouclé upholstery). The headrest is optional—I don't think you need it—but you can adjust the seat depth, the lumbar support can be aligned and pushed inward, and you can tilt the seat forward, too. Branch Branch Amazon On a tight budget? You won't find a better chair at this $300 mark. The Ergonomic Chair has many of the same adjustment points as the Pro, including seat depth, and has a similar design. Some of those finer adjustments aren't available, like pushing in the lumbar or the upright seat tilt. It generally won't keep your back as upright as possible, but if you like to recline a bit, this is a great buy at this price.

It’s usually good advice to buy whatever the latest release of a tech product is, especially if you're looking for the best Black Friday or Cyber Monday MacBook deal . In theory, that ensures you get the best performance and features, and will hopefully mean you won't have to replace it for many years. But in this case, you probably shouldn’t. Updated November 29: We've added some accessory deals and vetted prices. That might come as a surprise coming from me, especially since my evaluation of the M5 MacBook Pro was quite positive . There’s a lot to like about it. The M5's performance is a solid step up over the M4 , especially in the GPU department. The stuff that hasn’t changed is still really high-quality, including the Mini-LED display, excellent speakers, and iconic design. It’s been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect.

The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That’s a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air.

I compared Basepaws against Wisdom Panel , the other most popular at-home test kit for pets, and while I liked Wisdom Panel's interface a bit more, Basepaws had a lot more health information.

The trench swings open, and you can let water out via the button and put it back into the bottle by tilting it and holding the button. I like that you can hold it while your pup drinks, or lay it flat on the ground like a bowl. There’s a nice strap to grab it from, and there’s the option to add the company’s charcoal filters if you’re worried about water quality. (You don’t need to use the filters.)

In fact, in recent years, some of the most high-profile and brazen digital attacks around the world have been carried out by teens.

And whether you've never given much thought to your digital privacy and security or you've started to rein in your data, you can use this guide to implement basic precautions and keep operations security in mind. In other words, this guide contains advice and ideas to help you conceptualize how people can find out information about you from your digital activities—and start to minimize what’s out there in ways you didn’t intend. Protecting your digital privacy isn't a blanket prescription. Some people are more private by nature, and others prioritize putting themselves out there. But even if you're a 24/7 streamer, you can still think about your operations security, commonly known as opsec. What can viewers see in your room while you're streaming? Which people from your life have appeared onscreen? Could viewers figure out where you live from what they can see out your window? These same types of questions can be adapted for any type of onlooker—from the tech companies that operate the platforms you use to people browsing your social media or dating profiles or a friend (FORMER FRIEND) looking over your shoulder at your phone. In digital operations security, “operations” are the things that make up online activity like messages, searches, AI chats, websites, photos, accounts, passwords, and so on. The “security” piece has two goals. One is secrecy: No one sees stuff they shouldn’t. The other is availability: You don’t lose access to your data and accounts. Opsec is hard, because secrecy and availability conflict. The more secret you make things, the easier it is to accidentally lock yourself out and vice versa. Good security is a balance.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating. But remaining businesses (Value Retail + Ethnic + D2C + Luxury) will need investments in the near term.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said, “He said he did not say that, and I believe him 100%.” The Pentagon is under increasing scrutiny following a Washington Post report alleging that Pete Hegseth instructed forces to carry out a deadly strike on boats and explicitly required that everyone on board be killed. According to the report, this order resulted in a suspected second strike on 2 September targeting the damaged hull of a boat to kill two individuals who had survived the initial attack. “I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said, according to Bloomberg . When questioned about whether a follow-up strike would be lawful, he responded, “No, I wouldn’t have wanted that, not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.” Experts say the naval operations have been conducted under questionable legal authority, and they have increasingly unsettled US allies. The administration contends the vessels qualify as valid targets because they are allegedly transporting drugs. Trump said he had no worries about legal objections “because you can see the boats. You can see the drugs in the boats, and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans. So I think they do an amazing job.” The Republican-controlled armed services committees in both the Senate and House have announced they intend to carry out “vigorous oversight” of the alleged double-tap strike, which has sparked worries that the US might have breached the laws governing armed conflict, a report by CNN noted.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: India, home to the world’s sixth-largest food processing industry, may put in place new technical standards to curb the inflow of substandard imported machinery after a government study found that China accounts for 41% of India’s $843 million worth food-processing equipment imports. The food processing and consumer affairs ministries are looking to draft standards that will form the basis of upcoming Quality Control Orders (QCOs) that will mandate minimum safety, hygiene and performance requirements for all such machinery sold domestically, three senior officials involved in the development told Mint . The proposal comes amid concern over frequent breakdowns, low efficiency and safety risks associated with some imported machines—issues that are odds with the needs of a sector expanding into higher-value processed foods and global export opportunities. By making compliance with Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) norms compulsory, the proposed QCOs aim to lift manufacturing quality and reduce India’s heavy reliance on low-cost Chinese equipment. This move for quality control norms comes even as India is rolling back some QCOs covering sectors such as key textile, plastic and metal inputs to boost manufacturing. However, the absence of robust technical standards for the food processing sector has allowed low-quality products to enter the Indian market, undermining productivity as well as food safety. These norms could, however, also reshape supply chains, raise certification costs and test India’s ability to roll out standards without disrupting thousands of small and medium food-processing units. A growing industry As per the commerce ministry-led Indian Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), India’s food-processing market reached ₹ 30.50 trillion (about $367.5 billion) in 2024 and is expected to grow to ₹ 45.84 trillion (about $552.29 billion) by the end of FY26.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. NEW DELHI : \n     \n      Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will on Monday introduce a Bill in Lok Sabha to levy a new cess for public health and national security, replacing the GST compensation cess on tobacco, which will lapse when the Centre completes repayment of the loans raised to compensate states. Monday will be the first day of the 15-sitting winter session of parliament. As per the list of business in Lok Sabha, the proposed levy will be charged on machines or processes used to manufacture specified goods, but their details were not given. The new levy is likely to ensure that the overall tax burden on cigarettes, gutkha, pan masala and other tobacco products is maintained at the current level even after the expiry of the GST compensation cess. The Centre's move follows the GST Council’s decision in September to scrap the compensation cess on all goods except tobacco and shift to a largely two-rate structure, while leaving it to the finance minister to determine the exact timeline for tobacco’s transition to the proposed 40% GST slab for ultra luxury and ‘sin’ goods. With tobacco also attracting central excise, a parallel amendment to the Central Excise Act will be moved to synchronize the shift, as officials and tax experts say a fresh statutory mechanism is needed to maintain revenue and uphold the government’s deterrence-based tobacco taxation policy. A person informed about the Bill, on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that the proposed legislative amendment is required since the GST compensation cess on tobacco is set to expire. The proposed public health and national security cess will likely ensure that the tax incidence on tobacco, deemed a ‘sin' good, remains the same even after the GST compensation cess expires. Government policy aims to discourage tobacco use with high taxes and stringent labelling requirements.

The Saturday morning post, directed at airlines and “drug dealers”, had heightened regional concerns about potential US military action in Venezuela. According to Bloomberg , while speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump stated, \"Don’t read anything into it. We consider Venezuela to be not a very friendly country.” He confirmed he had spoken to President Nicolas Maduro during a phone call but refuted to provide details on how it went. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly,” he stated. Trump said in a Truth social post from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers. Please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\" Meanwhile, the United States is expanding its operations in the Caribbean, a campaign that started with deadly attacks on boats in international waters and escalated with the deployment of more Navy vessels, including an aircraft carrier, fueling speculation about a possible strike on Venezuela. Trump also played down Republican concerns about whether a deadly attack on a damaged boat in the Caribbean may have been unlawful. The Pentagon is under growing scrutiny following a Washington Post report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered lethal strikes on boats and insisted that everyone on board be killed. According to the report, this directive resulted in a second strike on Sept. 2 targeting the damaged hull of a boat to kill two survivors who had been injured in the initial attack. Trump mentioned, “I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.” When asked if a follow-up strike would have been lawful, he responded, “No, I wouldn’t have wanted that, not a second strike.

With Jerome Powell’s term ending in May, speculation has intensified over whether Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh or Christopher Waller will emerge as the administration’s preferred candidate. Speaking to reporters during an in-flight media interaction, Donald Trump confirmed that his mind is made up—but refused to reveal the name. “I know who I am going to pick, yeah,” Trump said on his way back to Washington. When asked directly whether National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett would be the choice, Trump replied: “I’m not telling you. We will be announcing it.” Donald Trump's remarks have fueled a fresh round of speculation within financial and political circles, especially as the White House looks set to make the announcement before the end of the year. Kevin Hassett, who previously chaired the Council of Economic Advisers and is widely viewed as a market-friendly voice, has been one of the most speculated names in recent weeks. A Bloomberg report last week positioned him as a leading contender. “We had a great Treasury auction, interest rates went down, and I think that the American people could expect President Trump to pick somebody who’s going to help them have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rate,” Hassett said on CBS . “That’s what we saw in the market response to the rumor about me.” Trump trusts Hassett and views him as aligned with the desire to push for more aggressive interest-rate cuts at the central bank, people familiar with the matter have said. Hassett has said he’d accept the role if asked, though analysts warn he may struggle to unite the Fed’s rate-setting committee and could be more vulnerable to Trump’s pressure. His emphasis on the market reaction was a de facto rebuttal to those concerns.

We said he could leave and go to Russia or he could go to another country,” Mullin told CNN. Despite growing concern in the region, Senator Mullin insisted President Donald Trump is not preparing a military invasion. “No, he’s made it very clear we’re not going to put troops into Venezuela,” Mullin said. “What we’re trying to do is protect our own shores.” His remarks come as Trump intensifies pressure on Caracas , declaring Venezuela’s airspace “closed” and expanding military operations targeting alleged drug traffickers. Trump issued his sharpest warning on Saturday, posting on Truth Social: “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.”  Venezuela denounced the statement as a “colonial threat”, calling it “illegal, and unjustified aggression” that violates its sovereignty and international law. Caracas accused Washington of maintaining a “permanent policy of aggression” against the country. US airstrikes since September have targeted suspected drug-smuggling vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing at least 83 people, according to officials. The strikes are part of Operation Southern Spear, which has attacked at least 21 boats. The US claims the boats were operated by drug traffickers, but has not released cargo evidence to support its assertions. The Pentagon has labeled the networks “foreign terrorist organisations,” placing them alongside groups like al Qaeda.T Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

Trump captioned his post, “Winning is always nice!” The clip was posted shortly after Trump again mocked former President Joe Biden ’s golf abilities during a Thanksgiving call with US military personnel. During the video call from the White House, a petty officer asked Trump what his “true golf handicap” was—and whether he and Biden would ever face off in a match. Trump replied confidently: “I mean, I’ve invited him, but he doesn’t want to show up.” He repeated his criticism of Biden’s swing: “Biden can’t hit a ball 30 yards… He said he was a six handicapper. That was the only thing that made me angry.” Trump reminded the service members of Biden’s backtracking during the 2024 debate: “He said he was a six… Then he said, ‘Well, I’m an eight.’ I said, ‘That was quick.’” Trump went on to list his own achievements on the course, touting the experience he often mentions publicly. “I’ve won 38 club championships, and I don’t get to practice much,” Trump said. He added that he won one as recently as last year, defeating a far younger opponent: “I beat a 27-year-old kid… The fairway doesn’t know how old you are.” While Trump did not provide an exact number, he insisted his handicap remains elite-level: “I’ve got to be right around scratch or better.

Speaking to Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on the People by WTF podcast, Musk highlighted the program’s international footprint. The tech entrepreneur expressed optimism about expanding Starlink operations to India , which would mark a significant step in the company’s goal of connecting underserved regions globally. Musk’s remarks signal a possible expansion of Starlink services into India , a market with high demand for improved connectivity, particularly in rural and underserved areas. “SpaceX is doing great work with the Starlink programme, providing low-cost, reliable internet throughout the world, and hopefully, India. We’d love to be operating in India. That would be great. We are operating in 150 different countries now, with Starlink,” Musk said. Musk emphasized that Starlink aims to deliver high-speed, low-latency internet to areas where traditional networks are unavailable or limited. The programme uses thousands of low-Earth orbit satellites to provide coverage worldwide. Musk explained the technical foundation of Starlink, emphasizing the low-Earth orbit satellites. “They’re at an altitude of about 550 km, which is generally at low Earth orbit. Because they are in low Earth orbit, the latency is low.” The Tesla CEO described the laser mesh that connects Starlink satellites, ensuring redundancy and reliability. “You have got thousands of satellites providing low-latency, high-speed Internet throughout the world, and they are interconnected as well.

In less than 20 years, maybe even 10 or 15, advances in AI and robotics will bring us to a point where working is optional.” To illustrate his vision, Musk compared future work to the choice of growing vegetables at home versus buying them from a store. “In the same way that you can grow your own vegetables or go to a shop and buy them, it’s much harder to grow your own. Some people enjoy it, which is fine. But it is optional—that is how I see work in the future,” he said.

The MRM's national convenor, S K Muddin, in a statement, said Muslims enjoy full Constitutional rights and security in the country. Madani had on Saturday alleged that efforts were being made in the country to establish the supremacy of one group through actions like bulldozer action, mob lynching, weakening of the Muslim Waqf and Islamic reforms. He also claimed that the perception that courts were working under government pressure had grown following the Babri Masjid verdict and many other decisions.

District authorities have initiated action against 28 Booth Level Officers (BLOs) in Bairia tehsil for alleged negligence during the Special Intensive Revision of the electoral rolls, reported news agency PTI on Sunday.  Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Assistant Electoral Officer Alok Pratap Singh told PTI that a review of the SIR work was conducted on Saturday, during which it was found that 28 BLOs had completed less than 25 per cent of the assigned revision work. Singh said such low completion numbers reflect \"serious laxity\" on the part of the officials. He added that a complaint has been submitted at the Bairia police station seeking registration of an FIR against all 28 BLOs.

He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability. The Foreign Office, in a press release, said that “like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan”. “While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” it said. It said Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”. “We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,” it said. Earlier this month, Pakistan's joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the 27th constitutional amendment bill, with the opposition alleging that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”. The amendment seeks to amend Article 243 by abolishing the position of 'Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee' and creating a new post of 'Chief of Defence Forces'. It also proposes the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court and aims to limit the powers of the Supreme Court.

Some social media influencers have found it difficult to eat.", "content": "Pagpag, also called second-hand fried chicken, has suddenly become a trend on Chinese social media. Influencers have started filming themselves tasting it. The dish has long been a staple in impoverished settlements in the Philippines, where families rely on it as a low-cost source of protein. It is made from discarded leftovers that are cleaned and cooked again. Its roots date back to the 1960s, when economic hardship prompted many people to migrate to crowded cities. Scavengers search for food scraps early each morning. Then, they sell them to small vendors. These vendors chop the pieces, add spices, and deep-fry everything to create a filling meal. For many households, the low cost of 20-30 pesos (under ₹ 150) makes it the only option they can afford. However, the viral videos have become a point of controversy. The controversy started with Chinese travel influencer Baozou Brother. With over 6.5 million followers, the vlogger posted a video trying the “second-hand fried chicken” in some poor areas of the Philippines, the South China Morning Post reported. His video went viral. He admitted that, even though the taste was ‘acceptable’, the idea behind the dish made it hard for him to eat it. Another Chinese influencer , known as “20 and still haven’t been to Starbucks”, also tried it. He mentally prepared himself by imagining he had gone hungry for days. “After all, I am a lifestyle experience blogger, and I have to do what I say. Locals really do eat this stuff. Look at this piece of meat, only half is left. I am just going to imagine that I have been in a desert for 10 days and nights and have no food to eat,” SCMP quoted him as saying. While eating, a few local children joined him. They all shared the food. He ended his video by pointing out the harsh reality. “This is the inequality of the world. What the rich throw away as scraps is a treasure here,” he said. The video has sparked strong reactions online.

According to the police, five men were taken into custody after the victim was discovered on Barbourne Road with critical injuries earlier that day, but all have since been released on bail. According to several reports, Sheoran hailed from Charkhi Dadri in Haryana, according to a statement by MLA Sunil Satpal Sangwan. Police said he was rushed to a hospital after being discovered with severe injuries, but he succumbed to them later that same day. In a post on X, Sangwan wrote, “Deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Vijay Kumar Sheoran, an Indian student from Village Jagrambas, District Charkhi Dadri (Haryana), who lost his life following a brutal stabbing incident in Worcester, United Kingdom.”  I earnestly urge the Government of India to intervene at the earliest and extend every possible support to the grieving family—especially by ensuring the urgent repatriation of his mortal remains to India, he further added. According to media reports, Sheoran had resigned from his government position with the Central Board of Excise and Customs earlier this year to pursue studies in the UK.  He was enrolled at the University of the West of England in Bristol. Police said he was discovered with life-threatening injuries on Barbourne Road in Worcester on November 25. His family has urgently sought diplomatic intervention to guarantee a thorough investigation and to arrange for his body to be brought back to India.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated.
