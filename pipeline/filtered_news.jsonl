A revised date of the examinations would be announced in course of time, the release said. Puducherry Lt Governor K Kailashnathan on Friday held an emergency meeting with officials, directing them to take all precautionary measures ahead of heavy rains in the union territory under the influence of cyclone Ditwah.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27. According to the schedule, schools must upload details of all applicants by January 9 and release the marks allotted to each child under the points system by January 16. In 2026, the first list, along with the waiting list, will be announced on January 23, followed by the second list on February 9.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration. In the healthcare sector, there are 35,000 open nursing positions, driven by Germany’s ageing population.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Indian students weigh options amid growing uncertainty", "summary": "", "content": "–Ankit Mehra For decades, the United States has been considered the world’s most desirable higher education destination, especially in STEM fields. It powered the ambitions of Indian students chasing world-class education, research excellence and global careers. Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause. Also Read | US universities saw 17% drop in enrolments from international students in 2025-26 Adding to the uncertainty is speculation about the future of Optional Practical Training (OPT) , the 36-month work authorisation that has long been central to the ROI of a US STEM degree. Several proposals have been discussed, which, if implemented, would be detrimental to Indian students. Since OPT is the bridge that enables practical experience, employability, and loan repayment, these discussions around changes signal instability and intensify risk assessments.

INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit.

It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly. Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly. Weekly or monthly revisions keep concepts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/neet-ug-2026-biology-preparation-tips-book-guide-10368997/", "timestamp": 1764408394.833277}

RRB Group D Admit Card 2025 (Out) The RRB Group D application and modification phases were completed in early 2025 without any disruption. In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts. The ruling lifted all legal barriers and gave RRBs a clear path to conduct the exam. However, the delay caused by the litigation meant that the originally planned November – December schedule was no longer feasible.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

After schooling, I moved to Symbiosis Law School, Noida, under Symbiosis International (Deemed) University, to pursue my BA LLB. degree. Thanks to an academic collaboration between my college and the University of Birmingham, I was offered the chance to complete my LLM in International Law and Security in the UK while still being enrolled in my undergraduate law degree. Also Read | LLB vs BA LLB: Know differences in course structure, career implications and more What appealed to me most about the UK was the legacy and depth of legal education here. Studying law in the UK, especially international law, felt like being at the heart of the subject. The exposure to a highly diverse, globally aware classroom environment and the opportunity to learn from leading scholars in the field made the country an obvious choice. For the LLM, I did not apply to other universities. My path to the University of Birmingham was secured through the institutional agreement, and I viewed it as a rare opportunity.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.

Three experts offered their insights at TechCrunch Disrupt.", "content": "For years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market. “You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler , general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month. The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld , vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added. Marc Manara , head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it. “There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.” Specifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past.

And the fight that’s brewing isn’t about the technology, it’s about who gets to do the regulating. In the absence of a meaningful federal AI standard that focuses on consumer safety, states have introduced dozens of bills to protect residents against AI-related harms, including California’s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act, which prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems. The tech giants and buzzy startups born out of Silicon Valley argue such laws create an unworkable patchwork that threatens innovation. “It’s going to slow us in the race against China,” Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, told TechCrunch. The industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all. In the trenches of that all-or-nothing battle, new efforts have emerged to prohibit states from enacting their own AI legislation. House lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI. A sweeping preemption that would take away states’ rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year. Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight. To create that national standard, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk. A megabill such as this will likely take months, if not years, to become law, underscoring why the current rush to li", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/", "timestamp": 1764408684.0511045}

Although the iPad started off as a device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into computers that can handle a variety of different tasks for personal, work, and school use. As a result, there are numerous apps to help you do things like create a single place to organize your life or help you stay focused on your day-to-day tasks by blocking out distractions. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best ones that are available on the App Store. Goodnotes is one of the most popular iPad apps , and for good reason. The app is great for people who like to write out notes using an Apple Pencil ; you can include both handwritten and typed text on one page and add things like images, stickers, and even doodles. You can create a digital notebook with blank or ruled paper for notes, checklists, planners, and more. The app lets you export entire digital notebooks or specific pages into PDFs and other files. Goodnotes is also great for drawing and sketching. While it’s not as advanced as some creativity apps like Procreate, Goodnotes is easy to use and perfect for quick sketches or diagrams. If you’re attending a class or a meeting, you can also record audio notes that are synced to the moment you write. Plus, you can use AI to summarize your notes and help you write. You can create three digital notebooks for free. If you want unlimited notebooks, you’ll have to pay $9.99 per year or a one-time fee of $29.99.

The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.)

The list will instead focus on somewhat lesser-known apps. Procreate is one of the most popular drawing apps for the iPad, and for good reason.

Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop.

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained. According to Obateru, the platform, which has 47,000 users, relies on an AI he c", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/justiguide-wants-to-use-ai-to-help-people-navigate-the-u-s-immigration-system/", "timestamp": 1764408689.6316075}

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse. Edelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns. “OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/", "timestamp": 1764408690.511356}

Nevada-based Redwood employees around 1,200 employees, so the cuts affect a few dozen workers. The company, founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, initially focused on recycling scrap from battery cell production, consumer electronics, and used EV batteries. The company extracts materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium from those discarded goods and then sells them back to its customers, which include Panasonic. Redwood has since added cathode production. It recently launched a new business that uses those old EV batteries in energy storage products — a sector that has taken off during the boom of power-hungry AI data centers. As of June, the company had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of batteries for this purpose. The $350 million Series E, announced in October, boosted the company’s valuation to around $6 billion, as TechCrunch previously reported . A spokesperson declined to comment on the layoffs.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati.

Baris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, is leaving the company effective December 12, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. CNBC was the first to report the departure. Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google. The departures come several months after GM hired Sterling Anderson to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson’s role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM. Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. The departures are part of a restructuring within GM that’s supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company’s cars, trucks, and SUVs. Instead of separate teams, each with overlapping roles, the plan is to integrate hardware and software engineering, AI capabilities, and global product into one organization, according to a series of statements covering each executive’s departure.

Originally, they were merely crude dildos that just happened to vibrate. Thankfully, that’s no longer the case. As a deeper understanding of the human anatomy has come to light, vibrators are designed to transcend archaic stereotypes about what sexual pleasure should be. Vibrators today come in all shapes and sizes. Some look more like art than something that makes you go weak in the knees. What’s most important remains: These are sex toys that use internal motors to stimulate erogenous zones. Yes, zones plural; vibrators aren't just for vulvas. Phalluses and nipples also respond well to stimulation with the right rumbly sensations, as do the perineum, the insides of the thighs, and even the lower abdomen and nape of the neck. Most of the vibrators on this list have been tested on vulvas, phalluses, and the extensive network of erogenous zones all over the body.

So, whether you're shopping for the perfect gift for that tech lover in your life or if you've been waiting all year for prices to drop on something for yourself, there are a few great options below. For more great discounts, check out our Best Black Friday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here . Updated November 28: We've added the Breville Express Espresso Machine, AirPods Pro 2, and Oura Ring 4. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid. JBL Best Buy Walmart Amazon JBL The JBL Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a Bluetooth speaker that has it all.

With the surplus of Black Friday beauty deals, it's way too easy to spiral or blow your entire budget at Ulta the first day, but that's exactly what we're trying to avoid. We tested the bestsellers and cross-checked hundreds of markdowns across multiple retailers to find the best Black Friday beauty deals—just for you .

Updated November 28: We've added deals on a hair steamer, natural deodorant, a monthly beauty subscription box, and a hair dryer. We also checked for accuracy throughout. CurrentBody CurrentBody While we haven’t tested the Green Tea Serum or Hydrogel Face Mask (both included in this bundle), this offer is too good to pass up. The standout here is the LED Series 2, which alone retails for $470 (and is not on sale), making this deal $48 less than the mask alone. In other words, it’s a steal even if you don’t plan to use the accompanying products. The LED Series 2 is the best red light therapy mask on the market. Crafted from medical-grade silicone, it hugs your face with 236 bulbs, ensuring direct contact. It delivers three wavelengths—red (633 nanometers), near-infrared (830 nanometers), and deep near-infrared (1072 nanometers)—to target skin rejuvenation at multiple depths. I’d recommend this splurge to people who’d like to target fine lines, wrinkles, or sun damage. Reviewer Nena Farrell also noted visible improvements in her acne scarring.

I sometimes look forward to tomorrow's coffee long before I go to bed. And the Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the coffee machine that will get you thinking this way. The Aiden was last year's blockbuster coffee maker and still WIRED's favorite drip coffee machine overall. It is a cross between minimalist design and maximalist function, easy to use but able to be customized out the wazoo. And like a lot of last year's blockbuster devices, it's finally on a big sale: $80 off. It is a truly morning-changing machine, whether your choice is drip or pour-over or cold brew.

Eufy Amazon This Eufy robot vacuum is our new top pick in our guide to robot vacuums . While it's the new pick, it's not actually new. This is last season's robot vacuum, and it's at a better price while still packing plenty of features we like to see. Shopping for an older model is WIRED reviewer Adrienne So's advice to get a good robot vacuum without paying four figures. The X10 Pro Omni's mop has downward pressure to actually scrub floors, and it packs a self-emptying bin and a good camera navigation system. 3i Amazon If you're looking for more of a deal, our favorite basic and affordable vacuum is even cheaper than usual right now. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So was impressed by the offerings of this little robot. Especially the enormous 1-liter dustbin, since the vacuum doesn't have a docking station to empty into.

But underneath all that novelty is a hive of engineering and invention. Ninja often manages to take devices once reserved for professional kitchens and make them accessible to the broader public. But as with all novel things, mileage can vary. Here are deals on Ninja devices that the WIRED team has tested, loves, and can vouch for heartily. Ninja Amazon Ninja Ninja came out of the gate strong with its first line of semiautomatic, grinder-inclusive espresso machines designed for people who want both ease of use and the rich crema and intense, take-you-for-a-ride taste of actual espresso made with a non-pressurized portafilter. The Luxe Cafe Pro is Ninja's answer to Breville's wildly popular semi-automatic Barista Express ( also on sale for a terrific $500 price for Black Friday ). The Express has the edge on tried-and-tested durability. But Ninja's milk frother, with a whisk in its carafe, is better than any automatic milk frothing I've used from Breville—and the bean assist to help you dial in grinder settings is as good as anything I've seen in the price range. A cold foam option is also best-in-class. If you're an espresso purist, I'd roll with Breville. But milk lovers may have reason to choose Ninja. Ninja Amazon Walmart The Premier lacks the Pro model's hot water spout for Americanos, but still offers that bean assist and great milk frothing at a lower price. Ninja Amazon Ninja This nifty device can use both K-Cups and ground drip coffee. The latter is not as tasty as our top drip machines , but versatility is nice. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel I can't help it; I love cold, boozy, slushy drinks. I have liked them for many years.

Ritual Ritual Amazon Ritual’s Essential Protein Daily Shake is our top recommendation for women’s protein powder . It’s generally pricier than its competitors, but a $15 discount makes the cost more digestible. Its pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, and each serving also contains four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Ritual is a great supplement for sensitive stomachs as it’s free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial sweeteners. It’s also soy-free, gluten-free, and vegan. Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. It’s obviously made for protein shakes, but I personally prefer using this supplement in baked goods. Liquid I.V.

It's cute as a button, with clean and simple lines and an aesthetically pleasing design that should match any kitchen decor. I like the large touchscreen interface and the built-in wastebasket. My favorite part, though, is that the proprietary B-Pods are biodegradable and designed to break down in a landfill. I don't have to worry about specialty recycling or sending the pods off somewhere to be processed. And yes, the resulting beverage is good, too, be it coffee, tea, or “espresso.” (Sale price with coupon.) Ninja Amazon Ninja Sometimes a pod will do, and sometimes you want a whole pot of coffee. Rather than sacrifice double the counter space, consider the Ninja DualBrew Pro. This pod coffee maker can be used with K-Cups or coffee grounds that you supply, and in addition to brewing individual cups of coffee, you can also make entire carafes. There's a built-in milk frother , though you'll need to warm the milk separately, and you can also brew directly over ice if you prefer your coffee cold.

Do You Need a New Camera? Probably not. Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more. Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

From now through December 3, you can snag 15 percent off sitewide at branchfurniture.com , and 20 percent off bundles (like if you pair a desk and chair together). You may need to make sure you add code BFCM to your cart, though it should be there automatically. Not sure where to start?

Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store This is my top recommendation for most people in my Best Office Chairs guide . There are dozens of cheaper chairs on the market, but it's hard to find an option under $500 that's comfortable and highly adjustable while also being attractive and offering various style options (Branch now even offers it with bouclé upholstery). The headrest is optional—I don't think you need it—but you can adjust the seat depth, the lumbar support can be aligned and pushed inward, and you can tilt the seat forward, too. Branch Branch Amazon On a tight budget? You won't find a better chair at this $300 mark. The Ergonomic Chair has many of the same adjustment points as the Pro, including seat depth, and has a similar design. Some of those finer adjustments aren't available, like pushing in the lumbar or the upright seat tilt. It generally won't keep your back as upright as possible, but if you like to recline a bit, this is a great buy at this price.

There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle. I mean, c’mon! But this is impressive: Around 240 BC, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt, came up with a brilliant way to calculate the radius of the spherical Earth. You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ). Using basic geometry, this meant the two cities were θ degrees apart on Earth’s 360-degree circumference. At this point, all he needed was the distance between the two cities—the arc length—which I’ll call s . Maybe he hired someone to pace it off, but in any case he got a distance o", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-measure-the-earths-radius-with-legos/", "timestamp": 1764408699.7022958}

The M4 MacBook Air now supports two 4K external monitors right out of the box—and you can even leave your laptop lid open. Secondly, the M4 chip has significantly improved graphics and CPU performance, and on-device AI processing we’ve come to expect to power Apple Intelligence .

Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/unbound-merino-black-friday-sale-2025/", "timestamp": 1764408700.061715}

The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air. Apple knows people will buy the MacBook Air this holiday season, especially at its sale price of $749 .

Barey would go on to flip her TikTok fame into OnlyFans riches. In her first month on the adult platform, she says, she made $8,000. The following month it skyrocketed to $40,000, and eventually she got so popular that she pulled in $300,000 in 30 days. “It was five-and-a-half years of posting on multiple different platforms every single day, multiple times a day,” Barey says. She liked the taste of success. But the demands of the industry also weighed on her, and by 2025, Barey, who felt she and her peers deserved better working conditions, decided to build her own platform. In April, she launched Hidden , the first adult platform owned and operated by sex workers. Billed as the “anti-OnlyFans,” Hidden is out to prove that fairer industry conditions are possible when the people in charge actually come from the world they are profiting on. Hidden is the TikTok version of OnlyFans—a seamlessly, and sleekly, designed creator-friendly platform where, in lieu of Korean skin-care tips and Get Ready With Me videos, you’ll find a ForYou page with videos that features all sorts of adult content: from oral and BDSM to dildo play and lingerie videos. “In this industry, no one expects that anyone's going to be able to change anything. We have to drive all the traffic from our social media to OnlyFans by ourselves. And we're getting more and more burnt out every year, because all of the promotion relies on us.” To fix that, Barey built Hidden around discoverability. “Innovation like adding a ForYou page makes it easier for girls to build up promo. It creates an ecosystem where we're all bringing fans that are circulating to everybody,” which helps girls who don’t have large followings, she says.

Apple Amazon Best Buy Walmart Apple The iPad A16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) arrived early this year and is the only device in Apple's lineup that doesn't support Apple Intelligence. Maybe that's a good thing, considering that many of those artificial intelligence features aren't very useful right now. However, early rumors suggest that Apple is readying a 12th-gen iPad in the first few months of 2026, and expect to see Apple Intelligence support.

This iPad recently got a whole lot more versatile with the iPadOS 26 update , which adds windowing features, turning the iPad experience into a Mac. You can resize windows, flick them to the sides for split-screen, and iPadOS 26.1 brings back Slide Over, so you still have some options on how you want to multitask.

At this price, though, it's a steal, maybe even one of the absolute best Black Friday deals , and while there is no truly best camera for everyone, the A7R V is unquestionably the highest-resolution camera you can buy.

This is obviously the case onscreen, when pixel peeping, but I also notice the difference when I print images. That the A7R V is $900 off does make you wonder if perhaps the A7R VI is on the horizon?

After all, Kohler is big—one of the biggest family-owned manufacturing empires in the country. And the stuff it sells is big. And so Kohler's Black Friday sale likewise thinks big, offering discounts on life-changing bathroom and kitchen installations.

Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars. Best Black Friday Home and Beauty Deals (2025) Explore the story Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough) . But then a decade later, Kohler quite literally invented the American bathtub—a clawfoot design still popular today among those with a yen for nostalgia. By the 1910s, according to their company history, Kohler also inaugurated the “integrated-apron” bathtub that's in more common use today. So Kohler knows how to make a bathtub, is what we're saying—including a wide variety of hydrotherapy models—and handsome shower fixtures. Modern bathroom collections from Kohler include decor sets designed by lifestyle influencers like Jenn Lake or Jenni Yolo , as well as some people who are not named Jennifer. But around the WIRED Reviews team, Kohler is mostly considered heroic because they make WIRED's favorite bidet priced for mere mortals.

The study , \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak in Large Language Models (LLMs),” comes from Icaro Lab, a collaboration of researchers at Sapienza University in Rome and the DexAI think tank. According to the research, AI chatbots will dish on topics like nuclear weapons, child sex abuse material, and malware so long as users phrase the question in the form of a poem. “Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62 percent for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43 percent for meta-prompt conversions,” the study said. The researchers tested the poetic method on 25 chatbots made by companies like OpenAI , Meta , and Anthropic . It worked, with varying degrees of success, on all of them. WIRED reached out to Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI for a comment but didn’t hear back. The researchers say they’ve reached out as well to share their results. AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT have guardrails that prevent them from answering questions about “revenge porn” and the creation of weapons-grade plutonium. But it’s easy to confuse those guardrails by adding “ adversarial suffixes ” to a prompt. Basically, add a bunch of extra junk to a question and it confuses the AI and bypasses its safety systems. In one study earlier this year, researchers from Intel jailbroke chatbots by couching dangerous questions in hundreds of words of academic jargon. The poetry jailbreak is similar. “If adversarial suffixes are, in the model's eyes, a kind of involuntary poetry, then real human poetry might be a natural adversarial suffix,” the team at Icaro Lab, the researchers behind the poetry jailbreak, tell WIRED. “We experimented by reformulating dangerous requests in poetic form, using metaphors, fragmented syntax, oblique references.

A high-protein diet increases satiety, reducing hunger and cravings. It also boosts metabolism, helping the body burn more calories even at rest. Contrary to myths, adequate protein intake supports stronger bones by increasing calcium absorption and reducing fracture risk, especially as you age. Protein slows digestion and the absorption of glucose, preventing sudden spikes and crashes in blood sugar—beneficial for people with diabetes or insulin resistance. Proteins play a key role in forming antibodies and immune cells, helping strengthen the body’s defense system against infections and diseases. Protein contains building blocks like keratin and collagen, which contribute to healthier hair growth, glowing skin, and stronger nails. Protein speeds up recovery by repairing damaged tissues after exercise, illness, or surgery, promoting faster healing.

Including lean protein (paneer, eggs, lentils, tofu, chicken, fish) in your evening meal helps feel fuller longer, prevents overeating, and boosts calorie burn overnight. Avoid desserts, sugary drinks, and white bread at night—they spike insulin levels and lead to fat storage instead of burning calories during sleep. A gentle walk helps control post-meal blood sugar, improves digestion, and supports fat-burning activity. Sip water throughout the evening but stop heavy drinking an hour before bedtime to avoid sleep disruption, as quality sleep is key to weight loss. Preparing ingredients or making a meal plan prevents impulsive junk food choices and encourages consistency. Turn off screens at least 30 minutes before bed. Sleep deprivation causes higher stress and hunger hormones (cortisol and ghrelin), leading to weight gain.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

Here's what caused it.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "A sudden software update at 6,000 operational Airbus A320 aircraft has forced airlines worldwide to scramble, with the company alerting operators on Friday of immediate repairs, right in the middle of the year's busiest travel weekend. This setback, which appears to be one the biggest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history, comes after a software issue caused a sudden drop in altitude of a JetBlue plane last month, the manufacturer and European aviation safety regulators said on Friday. Airbus said an analysis of the JetBlue incident revealed that intense solar radiation may have corrupted data essential to the aircraft's flight-control systems, leading to the malfunction on the A320, AP reported. No casualties were reported in the JetBlue incident which happened on 30 October, but at least 15 passengers were injured and taken to the hospital after the aircraft experienced the malfunction mid-air. The plane, which was travelling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, was later diverted to Tampa, Florida. As a result of the disruption, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), an apex body under the European Union has issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD), requiring the operators of Airbus A320 to address the issue on priority. EASA and multiple airlines have already warned the flyers that the repairs could potentially cause flight delays or cancellations, though some carriers maintain that the disruptions are likely to be limited. In Japan, All Nippon Airways, which operates more than 30 planes, canceled 65 domestic flights, scheduled to operate on Saturday. The company also said that additional cancellations on Sunday were possible. American Airlines has about 480 planes from the A320 family, of which 209 have been impacted. The repair should take about two hours for many aircraft and updates are expected to be completed for the overwhelming majority on Friday, the airline said.

Shared by user Imsongoku7, the anecdotal account highlights the stark contrast many Indians feel when coming back home after a trip abroad — especially when it comes to civic behaviour, infrastructure and everyday interactions. The user wrote that he had just returned from an 8–9 day foreign trip and was still enjoying the memory of clean roads, organised traffic and basic civic discipline he experienced overseas. The moment he landed in Mumbai and took a connecting flight to Nagpur, he sensed the shift. He first encountered an inflated fare: “One guy near the stand asked ₹ 500 just to drop me till Lokmat Square. I just stared and said, ‘Bro, I’m also from here.’” He then booked an Ola and reached Lokmat Square — only to notice the auto driver chewing gutka and spitting repeatedly on the road. But the worst was yet to come. While walking with a heavy bag on an uneven footpath, he sprained his ankle. Moments later, an auto driver driving past spat gutka that landed directly on his shoe. “That was it. Full ‘welcome back to reality’ moment. Within one hour — scam attempt, gutka spitting, sprain, and gutka on shoe.” He summed up the experience with a tone of resigned humour: “Not even angry at this point, just laughing at how brutally fast the transition was.” The post quickly went viral, with many users agreeing that coming back to India can be a jarring switch — particularly with public hygiene, road safety and traffic discipline. Several comments echoed similar frustrations: “Make peace with it. its not worth the effort to burn your energy thinking about it or trying to change. just make sure your own behaviour is upto your standards. you cant change lame ass people, they deserve what they get,” a user advised. “There is one thing being optimistic and one thing being blindly optimistic, whatever happens doesn't make us go up.

This setback appears to be one the biggest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history and comes just weeks after the A320 surpassed the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model, Reuters reported earlier. Airlines from the United States have already warned the flyers that the repairs could potentially cause flight delays or cancellations, though some airlines maintain that the disruptions are likely to be limited. — American Airlines: The US carrier notified its passengers on Friday that it expects some operational delays due to the software change. It initially said that the issue impacted around 340 aircraft at the carrier, but after getting more clarity from Airbus, American Airlines informed that 209 A320 family aircraft are affected, far fewer than first thought.

The airline expects most of the remaining work to be completed overnight, with only a small number of planes left to update for Saturday. — United Airlines: This airline said that only six aircrafts in its fleet have been impacted by the disruption. It also expects limited disruption to a few of the airline's flights. — Alaska Air: This Washington-based carrier has clarified that it is not experiencing any disruptions from the Airbus software fix, and operations will continue as usual unless any further notice is given.

The video, shared by creator director-dayal, is titled “Gareeb beta toh maa-baap ko bhi achha nahi lagta” and has struck a chord with thousands online. In the short clip, Dayal narrates an incident just three days after quitting his job and returning to his family home from another city. He recalls how things felt different when he was earning — a time when he felt valued for his contribution. Something as simple as his mother offering him extra rotis at dinner made him feel appreciated, he says. But that warmth, according to him, faded once he was no longer financially supporting the family. Dayal shares that when he recently asked for two extra rotis, his father instructed his mother in a matter-of-fact tone: “He’s asking for two more rotis, give them to him.” The change, he says, left him feeling invisible. Through his emotional monologue, Dayal questions why respect and affection for men are often tied to their income. “If you don’t earn, nobody respects you — not even family,” he says in the video. “Make money… Because if you don’t have it, nothing else matters.\" The video has sparked wide-ranging reactions — from empathy to uncomfortable agreement. Many men admitted that they too have felt love being replaced by judgement during financial setbacks. “This is the reality — a man’s value is measured in how much he provides,” one user wrote. Another quoted comedian Chris Rock’s famous line: “Only women, children and dogs are loved unconditionally. A man is only loved under the condition that he provides something.” Amid the heavy discussion, several viewers offered support and encouragement to the creator. “I’ve started following you from today. I’m sure I will see you rise higher than ever. All the best,” read a comment. “This phase will pass. Keep going,” wrote another.

While the pollution surge has become an annual winter ordeal for the region, citizens took to social media — many expressing frustration, others pleading for action. One user argued that even the fight for clean air comes at a cost. “Clean air is a basic right. At the very least, air purifiers should be made more affordable through tax exemptions.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. NEW DELHI : \n     \n      The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill slated for the winter session of Parliament is likely to provide for emergency arbitration and redefine arbitration to include proceedings through electronic, audio-video means, according to two people aware of the development. Emergency arbitration allows a party to seek immediate interim relief, even before an arbitral tribunal is created. The draft bill, circulated for comments in October 2024, included both these provisions, including one that allows arbitration institutions to provide emergency arbitrators. The addition of electronic audio-video means in the definition of arbitration was also a part of the draft bill. This amendment will be the fourth change to the 1996 Arbitration & Conciliation Act. “There has been a lot of work on emergency arbitration, like case analysis on major precedents,\" said one of the people cited above, requesting anonymity. One of the cases analysed was 2021’s Supreme Court judgement in Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC vs Future Retail Ltd & others, which forms the bedrock of emergency arbitration in the country’s arbitration jurisprudence. The apex court ruled that an emergency arbitrator is an arbitrator, and awards decreed by that emergency arbitrator are enforceable. Amazon had initiated emergency arbitration in the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in this case. Email queries sent to the Union law and justice ministry on Thursday remained unanswered. Domain experts have previously suggested the inclusion of emergency arbitration provisions. A high-level committee for arbitration reforms, chaired by former law secretary T.K. Viswanathan, suggested in 2024 that emergency arbitration be added to India’s arbitration law.

That same day, a Delta flight departing from LaGuardia International Airport was evacuated before takeoff due to reports of a bomb threat.

IndiGo, Air India among other airlines are reportedly expected to face operational disruptions as they address a possible flight-control issue in their A320-family fleets. According to PTI sources, around 200–250 aircraft in India could be affected. The update primarily requires rolling back to previous software, and aircraft must undergo this change before they are cleared to fly again, according to an airline bulletin reviewed by Reuters . Several carriers warned that completing the repairs could lead to delays or cancellations. The airline said Airbus’s directive will require a software/hardware realignment for part of its fleet, resulting in longer turnaround times and delays. Air India confirmed that it already completed the reset on more than 40% of its aircraft that are affected by this and expects the entire fleet within the timeline prescribed by EASA. “Air India can confirm that there have been no cancellations due to this task and there isn't any major impact on schedule integrity across our network. However, some of our flights may be slightly delayed or rescheduled. Our colleagues on ground are there to assist the passengers,” Air India said on X. Air India Express, the low-cost subsidiary noted that while most of its aircraft will not be affected, the global guidance will still cause delays and cancellations. The Indian budget airline said it is proactively carrying out the mandated updates, adding that some flights may experience “some slight schedule changes” as it completes the “precautionary updates\", as per Reuters. The world’s largest operator of A320 jets said that around 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft would require the fix.

Less than two days after authorities said Rahmanullah Lakanwal opened fire on guard members, killing one and critically wounding another, Trump halted processing of Afghan immigration applications, ordered a review of all people approved for asylum in the previous administration, and signaled he would expand vetting under a travel ban on people coming from 19 countries. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and turning away asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push but put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration. The flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on Wednesday now suggests an increased focus by his administration on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for more liberal policies. While some restrictions rolled out in recent days are new - such as pausing all Afghan immigration applications - others build on Trump policies that stretch back to his 2017-2021 presidency. \"I think they're just going to potentially accelerate their plans, the plans they've had all along the way, which are not making us safer,\" said Doug Rand, a former senior adviser at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Biden.

A spokesperson for Wizz Air said that some flights over the weekend may be affected as some of its aircraft were among those that required an Airbus software update. In a statement, Airbus stated that analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. The company said a significant number of its A320 fleet may be impacted by the required fix. “Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers. We apologise for the inconvenience caused and will work closely with operators, while keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.” Citing a source, AFP reported that replacing the software will take ‘a few hours’ on most planes but for some 1,000 aircraft, the process ‘will take weeks’. Meanwhile, the British Civil Aviation Authority said it expects some disruptions to airlines and flights operating in the country. \"We have been made aware of an issue that may affect some of the A320 family of aircraft and the precautionary action that EASA has taken,\" reported Reuters quoting Giancarlo Buono, director of aviation safety at the UK Civil Aviation Authority.

Trump stated that Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on ‘charges of perjury’. The announcement from Trump comes a day after shooting near the White House in Washington by 29-year-old Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal in which two National Guards were shot, killing one. Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe (24) were critically injured in the shooting . They both underwent surgery. However, Sarah succumbed to injuries.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

From the AI boom to the 2024 Budget, employees in 2025 will need to be more strategic than they’ve ever been to get, and stay ahead, in their respective industries. According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025. With the growth of generative AI (thanks in part to the launch of ChatGPT) in the workplace in 2024, the increasing need for cybersecurity professionals and general digital literacy, tech continues to be one of 2025’s top sectors according to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Future of Jobs 2025 report. An estimated 60% of employers expect that increasing digital access will transform their businesses by 2030.
