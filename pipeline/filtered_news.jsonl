The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763594038.975657}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion. European and East Asian universities are also in negotiations,” he said. As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared. Recognising that reading lengthy passages on screens differs from paper, test-makers deliberately reduced passage lengths. Everything now fits on one screen, doing-away with the need for excessive scrolling. For years, XAT has carried a reputation for being one of the “toughest” MBA entrance examinations.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763594074.5472443}

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete. Germany’s medical qualification, the Staatsexamen is a six-year program conducted in German, requiring at least C1-level proficiency in the language.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic. They influenced a well-known mathematician named Al-Khwarizmi, who lived in present-day Iraq.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive.

In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

READ MORE| India’s top IITs rank slip as universities from China, Singapore surge ahead in QS Asia Rankings 2026 The ranking of Asian universities, released on Tuesday, reflects an eastward concentration of top performance, QS said. Indian institutions retain strong reputations but face stiff competition from those in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, which are outperforming them on metrics like ‘citations per paper’, which is a measure of the impact of research, faculty-student ratio, and international student ratio. Reacting to the rankings, Prof Chakraborty said: “The QS rankings are one of several reference points in a very broad and complex global higher education ecosystem. A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/qs-world-rankings-asia-universities-2026-ranks-indian-institutes-drop-rank-iit-kharagpur-director-reacts-suman-chakraborty-10347239/", "timestamp": 1763594085.9846916}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Nearly half of them believe their roles AI can make a switch in their jobs within the next three to five years. According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations. Among those worried that artificial intelligence could replace their roles, at least 40% are actively considering an exit.

Watching SpaceX build reusable rockets and develop space robotics sparked in me a dream to be part of such innovation. I wanted to be in a place where I could explore similar ideas and be surrounded by people who shared the same curiosity and drive. I first appeared for JEE Advanced right after Class 12 and managed a decent rank, but I wanted to improve. I decided to take a drop year and give it one more serious attempt. That decision changed my life — the following year, I secured admission into IIT Mandi. Preparing for JEE Main and JEE Advanced was not easy. During my drop year, I joined a coaching in Kota and studied nearly six to eight hours a day. I never enjoyed inorganic chemistry, but my biggest challenge wasn’t the syllabus – it was maintaining consistency under pressure. There were moments of burnout and self-doubt, but my parents and teachers encouraged me to push through. But now, when I look back, I feel it was all worth it. I am doing Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Mandi . My hometown is Bhind, Madhya Pradesh. I completed my schooling at a CBSE school. My father is a businessman, and my mother a homemaker — both have been my strongest support system. What I miss most about Bhind is the sense of belonging that only home can bring. When choosing a branch, I initially leaned toward Aerospace Engineering and Robotics. However, with my background in biology, I found Bioengineering fascinating because it connects biology, computation, and robotics – fields that can truly impact society. In JoSAA counselling, I also considered Aerospace and Electrical Engineering, but the thought of studying in a serene, hilly campus drew me to IIT Mandi.

An “infamous mystery hacker” known as the Puppet Master is wreaking havoc on the internet, breaking into the so-called cyber-brains of several humans as well as “every terminal on the network.” As it turns out, the Puppet Master is a creation of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In other words, the Puppet Master is what we would call today a government-backed hacker, or advanced persistent threat ( APT ). In this case, however, the “phantom” hacker goes rogue and is wanted for “stock manipulation, spying, political engineering, terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.” That is the basic premise of the Japanese anime cult classic “ Ghost in the Shell ,” which marked its 30th anniversary this week since its debut, and was based on the chapters titled “Bye Bye Clay” and “Ghost Coast” from the first volume of the eponymous manga, released in May 1989. To say that the story of the Puppet Master was ahead of its time may be an understatement. The World Wide Web, essentially what flourished from the internet as we know it today, was invented in 1989, the same year that the first volume of “Ghost in the Shell’s” manga — including the story of the Puppet Master — hit newsstands in Japan. (The World Wide Web publicly launched in 1991.) In the manga, when the Puppet Master gets caught, an official from Public Security Section 6, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explains that they had been after the hacker “for a long time,” and they “profiled his behavioral tendencies and code/tech patterns.” “As a result, we were finally able to create a special anti-puppeteer attack barrier,” the official says in the manga. At the risk of extrapolating too much from a couple of sentences, the reality is that what the official is describing is basically what cybersecurity companies, such as antivirus firms, do everyday to stop malware. Not only do they create so-called signatures based on the malware’s code, but also based on its behavior and prope", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/how-the-classic-anime-ghost-in-the-shell-predicted-the-future-of-cybersecurity-30-years-ago/", "timestamp": 1763594372.0505817}

Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new. “Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same. “Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said. Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.” Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox. “So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox.

For instance, the company said moderation times for submissions would be sped up, the site will be able to remove display ads in the weeks ahead, and its mobile apps will become free downloads with free subscriptions. “Through our recent discussions with Spotify, it became clear that we share a strong belief in the power of musical context — and a vision for helping listeners go deeper into the songs they love,” the post penned by the WhoSampled team reads. “Spotify has shown a genuine commitment to our mission, and we couldn’t have found a better home for WhoSampled,” it stated.

Suno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix. The company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal . It previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024 , led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. But Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission. Those types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material.

Across North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. Data centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News. The report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. At the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.) This year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up. Still, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. Most of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work.

However, Kiki’s model violated local short-term rental laws, leading to its shutdown this past June. The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay more than $152,000 to settle charges. Backed by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences. However, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. When the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data. Additionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower. According to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. “This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/subletting-startup-kiki-paid-over-152k-to-settle-charges-after-violating-nyc-short-term-rental-laws/", "timestamp": 1763594373.1501818}

The moderation changes are rolling out with the latest version of the Bluesky app (v. 1.110), which also includes a dark-mode app icon and a redesigned feature for controlling who can reply to your post. The company says the moderation updates are a result of Bluesky’s rapid growth and the need for “clear standards and expectations for how people treat each other” on the platform. “On Bluesky, people are meeting and falling in love, being discovered as artists, and having debates on niche topics in cozy corners. At the same time, some of us have developed a habit of saying things behind screens that we’d never say in person,” the company shared in an announcement, explaining the changes.

At launch, it’s giving 100GB of storage to users on its free tier. This is Poly’s second inning from a product perspective. The company was started by founders Abhay Agarwal and Sam Young in 2022. Young has since left the company. At that time, the startup, which had participated in the startup accelerator Y Combinator, allowed users to create 3D assets using prompts . Agarwal, who is a research fellow at Microsoft and worked on vision AI to help the visually impaired, said the company didn’t predict that the AI image and asset generation industry would blow up and competitors would raise large sums rapidly. That’s when the team decided to pivot. “We interviewed our users and asked them what the pain points of their workflows were that could be solved by AI. Turned out that one big unmet need for users was organizing their file system. As a user, you have a lot of files on your computer, and it is hard to find stuff. We wanted to solve for that,” Agarwal said. He said that the startup shut down the previous iteration of Poly in 2023, went into stealth, and started building the new cloud-based file organizer.

TechCrunch reported in October that Spotify was developing the SongDNA feature as a way to help users discover music through a song’s credits, after references to the feature were spotted in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong. With SongDNA, Spotify users could explore the other projects that the artists, musicians, and others who worked on a track are involved with.

Synthesis is the creation of new molecules by using chemical reactions. It’s like a recipe or Lego pieces, where small pieces, ingredients, molecules, come together to form a wider puzzle picture, a food dish, a larger molecule. As one might expect, it’s quite hard to create those small molecules that go on to build bigger ones. For Boiko, a PhD candidate studying machine learning in chemistry at Carnegie Mellon (he received his bachelor’s and master’s in organic chemistry from a university in Russia), that meant realizing that drug hunters — the scientists who oversee drug discovery and development — were skipping promising ideas just because the chemical molecules to create the drugs seemed too hard to make. “The compounds never even got a chance to be tested,” Boiko told TechCrunch. For Tyrin (who received his bachelor’s in computer science at MIT), his time working on drug discovery computational pipelines made him realize how behind the world of drug discovery was. “The models could generate ideas in hours, but it could take months for the lab to catch up,” he told TechCrunch. “We both saw that the world was throwing money into molecular design and almost ignoring the harder problem of actually making the molecules,” Boiko said. But there was a geopolitical angle too, he continued, global supply chains are becoming vulnerable, and the U.S. is entering a trade war and innovative competition, once again, with China. “It was clear,” Boiko said. “Small molecule synthesis needed to be rebuilt from the ground up in the United States.” Boiko and Tyrin came together to create Onepot, a company that is home to the small-molecule synthesis lab POT-1.

Aaron Saunders, who is partly responsible for giving the world backflipping and dancing machines, joined as the VP of hardware engineering earlier this month. The hire is a key part of CEO Demis Hassabis’ vision for Gemini to become a sort of robot operating system, similar to how Google supplies its Android software to an array of smartphone manufacturers. “You can sort of think of it as a bit like an Android play [...] We want to build an AI system, a Gemini base, that can work almost out-of-the-box, across any body configuration,” Hassabis said in an interview with WIRED. “Obviously humanoids, but non-humanoids too.” Boston Dynamics is famous for developing legged robots, including four-legged dog-sized systems and humanoid machines, capable of impressive acrobatic feats. Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company Alphabet in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years.

When it debuted at CES early this year, the Brisk It Zelos-450 was advertised as being \"the first grill with generative AI.\" That AI comes in the form of \"Vera,\" an in-app feature that “creates customized recipes based on your input\" and then sets the grill's temperature to cook them. The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice. Here's why.

It's already a great screen at the full price, but Best Buy currently has it marked down to just $600 . That's a significant markdown for this TV, which can typically be found between $1,000 and $1,200. LG Amazon Walmart LG Costco The star of the show is LG's OLED panel, the type typically found on TVs twice the price. If you're curious why that's so important, we have a great explainer that breaks down the difference between all the different panel types . The important takeaway here is that the pixels emit their own light, allowing individual spots of the screen to be perfectly black. The result is impressive, with incredible contrast between the brightest and darkest spots that's best understood by seeing it in person. The other areas of the screen are excellent as well. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata opined that “there's a sumptuous touch to images of all sorts,\" and liked the colors as well, which were accurate and sharp without any adjustment. The screen has a natural and vivid performance to it that feels all the more impressive when you consider the price point. It has the chops for some gaming too, with feature support that meets or beats higher-end screens. With four proper HDMI 2.1 inputs, your consoles won't need to fight for the good ports, which is a nice surprise for the price point. It can reach a refresh rate of up to 120Hz, which is just fine for most console gamers, and has both AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync to make sure everything is smooth, plus Auto Low Latency Mode for quick response times.

Interactions with AI tools are often mundane, but they can also lead to dire outcomes. Users sometimes experience mental breakdowns during lengthy conversations with chatbots or confide in them about their suicidal ideations . “We need to have really big conversations across society about what role we want AI to play in our future as humans who are interacting with each other,” says Ryn Linthicum, head of user well-being policy at Anthropic . At the event‚ organized by Anthropic and Stanford, industry folk intermingled with academics and other experts, splitting into small groups to talk about nascent AI research and brainstorming deployment guidelines for chatbot companions. Anthropic says less than one percent of its Claude chatbot’s interactions are roleplay scenarios initiated by users; it’s not what the tool was designed for. Still, chatbots and the users who love interacting with them as companions are a complicated issue for AI builders, which often take disparate approaches to safety . And if I’ve learned anything from the Tamagotchi era , it’s that humans will easily form bonds with technology. Even if some AI bubble does imminently burst and the hype machine moves on, plenty of people will continue to seek out the kinds of friendly, sycophantic AI conversations they’ve grown accustomed to over the past few years. “One of the really motivating goals of this workshop was to bring folks together from different industries and from different fields,” says Linthicum.

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763594377.8460572}

I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again.

This initiative is called “FIFA Pass.” “FIFA Pass is a prioritized appointment scheduling system,” Infantino said from the Oval Office. “So if you have a ticket for the World Cup, you can have a prioritized appointment to get your visa. Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States. Then, the user must enter a FIFA portal, which will indicate the steps to follow in order to proceed with the visa application. To expedite these procedures in the face of the anticipated increased demand for tourist visas, Rubio noted that the State Department has dispatched more than 400 additional consular officers around the", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-will-prioritize-visa-processing-for-fans-with-world-cup-tickets/", "timestamp": 1763594379.8485835}

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108. Oddly, photo-based translations work with 113 languages. Lastly, real-time call translation has suppo", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/vasco-translator-q1/", "timestamp": 1763594380.0655174}

It's also put out one of the better stick-drift eliminating Hall effect grips for PC and Xbox players in recent memory with 2024's H.E.A.R.T. controller . So what happens when they get thrown into a blender? Out pours the ESWAP X2 H.E., combining all the customization of the ESWAP range but finally delivering the pro-tier precision of Hall effect . It outperforms both its parents—but has also inherited some of the family's worst traits. When I reviewed the H.E.A.R.T. Controller, I termed it \"an entry-level pro controller\". By extension, the ESWAP X2 H.E. is what you might graduate to. Compared to that predecessor, it feels like a massive upgrade—from the overall build quality to the almost daunting versatility of its swappable components, everything about it feels like it's giving you more . However, for those coming from previous generation ESWAP pads , it's unlikely to seem quite so revolutionary—in fact, it's essentially the same, bar the addition of Hall effect tech. Out of the box, the X2 H.E. looks suitably impressive, a monolith of black broken up only by the copper tones of the D-pad and triggers, subtly matched by the lettering on the face buttons and dragon \"2\" of the logo. The LED color bar of the H.E.A.R.T. is gone, making this look and feel far more mature, although the mix of matte black for fixed features and glossy removable modules does make for a degree of visual inconsistency. In the hand, it's definitely better suited to those with larger grips, thanks to a chunky overall size of 160 x 120 x 60 mm and the unusual height of the default thumbstick modules. These sit about 12 mm from their base, compared to the approximately 8 mm of a standard Xbox controller, and you can immediately feel the difference. Thrustmaster ESWAP X2 H.E.

The 32-year-old Michigan engineer, who did not want to use his real name due to privacy concerns, first watched porn at the impressionable age of 12, but never realized he had a problem until just after his father’s funeral three years ago. “I didn't shed a single tear,” he says. “I didn't know how to react happily or sadly to anything.” That’s when his porn consumption spiraled—combined with stress, anxiety, and depression—and he locked himself in his room “all day.” The only thing that seemed palpable, he recalls, “was that rush of dopamine” delivered by an intense session of hardcore porn viewing. But for Jamie, who is Christian, those fleeting moments of porn-fueled transcendance were followed by far deeper lows, including suicidal ideations. This past March, Jamie says his partner angrily confronted him over his compulsive porn consumption, accusing him of lying and committing adultery. Jamie’s “entire world came down.” He admitted he felt that he was addicted, begged for her forgiveness, temporarily moved back in with his mother, and renounced porn. That’s when he found Relay , an app created by a pair of Mormon college students that claims it can help people “take back control from porn, one day at a time.” Jamie promised his partner he would never watch porn again—and she gave him one chance. The app provides a comprehensive plan to stop watching porn, with videos by therapists, daily journal prompts, live group sharing sessions, and a function to address serious urges. Users even keep track of each other’s porn-free streaks, with a “Live Milestone” ticker. This is all in an effort to help customers, who pay $149 per year for full access, unpack their underlying issues like loneliness and trauma to help prevent relapse. The app has been downloaded over 110,000 times, with company data showing that 89 percent of its users are male.

The Great Meme Reset of 2026, as it’s being called on TikTok , demands that on January 1 all memes revert to their 2010s glory days. Bland “ brain rot ” and AI -looking memes are out; Big Chungus is in. As with anything on the internet, the origin of the Great Meme Reset is hard to place. Most sources point to a March post from TikTok user @joebro909 that called for a whole new generation of memes to save the platform from the “ drought ” that had engulfed it in the spring. The post said nothing of a January 1 launch date, or a return to the memes of the last decade, but the idea was planted. Now hundreds of posts are discussing the reboot—and a return to the internet’s “dank” era. Which implies, of course, that memes lack dankness these days. If anything, Gen Z– and Gen Alpha–fueled internet culture has prided itself on somewhat meaningless content like “ 6 7 ” and absurdist, seemingly AI-generated “ Italian brain rots ,” but after nearly a year of memes with little humanity or depth, a backlash has begun. “Because of just how unrecognizable memes have become,” TikTok creator Noah Glenn Carter ( @noahglenncarter ) said in a recent video, “everyone has come to an agreement that on January 1, 2026, we are going to completely reset all memes and go back to the originals.” When I reach Carter via email, the creator seems pretty convinced the reset idea could take off, and he plans to make more videos promoting it. “The memes we have now are called ‘brain rot’ for a reason,” Carter says. “The ones 10+ [years older], most of the time, had a story behind them. Or they at least made sense. Now it just seems like the more random and incoherent something is the more likely it is to become a meme.” Even if you’re in the camp that understands memes like “6 7” have more significance than they’re given credit for, there’s still a sense amongst the Great Rese", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-great-meme-reset-is-coming/", "timestamp": 1763594381.829944}

It also removed one: Launchpad. The feature, which gave Mac users an iPhone-like grid of applications complete with support for folders, is missing from macOS 26. Now, to be fair, a lot of people didn't really use Launchpad. Many people keep their most-used applications on their dock and turn to Spotlight, or other launchers like macOS's new Apps window, to quickly access the rest. But Launchpad had a few die-hard users, many of whom are mourning the loss of the feature on social media. What are they supposed to do? The good news: There are a few decent replacements. I tried out several, and here's the one I think is best (followed by a few other suggestions).

But there is a crucial Launchpad feature it offers: folders. Organization gets a lot more useful when you slot things into folders. I, for example, made a folder for all of my games. You can create folders within your launch grid. There are a few settings you can tweak, such as whether the launcher should take over the full screen or open in a window. You can also configure the appearance, decide whether the app should open when your Mac does, and set a keyboard shortcut for opening the launcher. Customize the look. As I said, it’s not a perfect replacement, but take some time setting up folders and tweaking the settings and I think you'll find it works well. And you can't complain about the price.

The first drag from a friend’s vape several years ago offered the shy teenager a new way to escape. This article was copublished with The 74 , a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here . She quit cutting but got hooked on nicotine. Her sadness got harder to carry after her uncle died, and she felt she couldn’t turn to her grieving parents for comfort. Bumming fruity vapes at school became part of her routine. “I would ask my friends who had them, ‘I’m going through a lot, can I use it?’” Gutierrez, now 18, told The 74. “Or ‘I failed my test and I feel like smoking would be better than cutting my wrists.’” It worked until she got caught. Like students across the country, Gutierrez got dragged into a nicotine-fueled war between vape manufacturers—including a company that leveraged online advertisements on the websites of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to hook kids on e-cigarettes —and educators, who’ve turned to digital surveillance tools and discipline to crack down on the youngest users. Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour. An in-depth investigation by The 74 reveals how nicotine-addicted teens, who often begin vaping under social pressure or, like Gutierrez, to cope with hardship, are routinely kicked out of school instead of receiving meaningful services that could steer them away from tobacco and help them break free of their vape pens. Candid interviews with a dozen high schoolers and recent graduates from across the country reveal how vaping has become ubiquitous in schools.

The world, and especially Hallmark movies, is full of holiday disaster stories: burnt turkeys, failed desserts, steamed hams . But I'm not bragging when I say that the first Thanksgiving dinner I prepared for my extended family—a little early, this year—was an unmitigated success. My aunt couldn't stop talking about the black pepper in the biscuits and the sage on the carrots. My uncle went in for the turkey and the apple-sausage stuffing. My father didn't speak at all, unless prompted. He just ate and ate. This was a compliment. But of course, I had cheated. I had ordered my Thanksgiving in the mail—one of the new breed of Thanksgiving meal kits. The meal was genuinely home-cooked, of course, prepared mostly from scratch. But the entire seven-platter feast—its ingredients and recipes—had arrived two days before, in a box large enough to house a primal cut of beef. It was Thanksgiving in a box: a $200 “Chef's Table Thanksgiving” meal kit available from sister meal delivery plans Sunbasket and Gobble . The spread from Sunbasket was vast and generous. The table contained a nearly 3-pound roast of turkey, mounds of mashed potato, pebbled cranberry compote, roasted carrots dressed in miso-sage butter, brussels sprouts dappled with pecorino romano and pancetta, an endless platter of fennel-apple-sausage-stuffing, Gruyère black-pepper biscuits caked more than an inch tall, a tureen of deep brown turkey gravy, a ginger apple crisp waiting in the wings. Sunbasket is among a new bounty of meal kit companies that aim to ease the stress of the holidays by doing the planning and the shopping for you—big meal boxes tailor-made for those who still want to make a home-cooked meal but for whom the prospect of planning a vast and complicated feast is prohibitive.

That's quite the deal on a product that doesn't often see major discounts, and you can use that gift card to accessorize your new headset. Meta Best Buy (Walking Dead Bundle) Amazon Walmart Meta Meta's lineup of stand-alone headsets has slowly improved over the last few years, with frequent updates adding functionality and growing the library of games. You don't need a computer or console to power them, which makes it easy to just toss the headset on and start playing without any extra steps. With object and hand tracking, sometimes you don't even need controllers, and the pass-through camera lets you blend the real world and the virtual one for awesome mixed reality experiences. While the Quest 3S is the more budget-friendly offering in the current generation of headsets, the compromises aren't as major as you might be thinking. The screen is slightly lower resolution, and the pass-through isn't quite as sharp, but otherwise the Quest 3S plays the same games and experiences as the more expensive Quest 3 . Both headsets suffer from limited battery life, so don't expect more than a couple of hours of play at a time. I haven't had a chance to play the included game, Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, but it's described as a survival action game set in a zombie-ridden version of New Orleans. You'll have to make tough decisions about how to deal with other survivors, and it looks like there are plenty of opportunities to slay zombies.

Heavy sleepers know how easy it is to snooze through the overly genteel alarms on your phone. For people who can’t get out of bed without a bigger jolt, extreme alarms have popped up in recent years—from relatively simple puzzle-alarm phone apps to alarms on wheels to alarms that shake the bed. Not only are these an innovative way to get chronic snoozers out of bed, but they can be great for those who are hard of hearing, utilizing different frequencies and pitches as well as movement through vibration. I’m a very heavy sleeper, so I tried one of these nontraditional extreme alarm clocks every day for a full week (at least). I chose the extreme alarms that were the most rated or reviewed online, found most often on online retailers like Amazon and in the app store, and tried to get a versatile range of options that focused on different areas, whether it be sound or activity.

Agent 365 is not a platform for making enterprise AI tools; it’s a way to manage them, as if they were human employees . Companies using generative AI agents in their digital workplace can use Agent 365 to organize their growing sprawl of bots, keep tabs on how they’re performing, and tweak their settings. The tool is rolling out today in Microsoft’s early access program. Essentially, Microsoft created a trackable workspace for agents . “Tools that you use to manage people, devices, and applications today, you'd want to extend them to run agents as well in the future,” says Charles Lamanna, a president of business and industry for Microsoft’s Copilot , its AI chatbot. Lamanna envisions a future where companies have many more agents performing labor than humans. For example, if a company has 100,000 employees, he sees them as using “half a million to a million agents,” ranging in tasks from simple email organization to running the “whole procurement process” for a business. He claims Microsoft internally uses millions of agents. This army of bots, with permission to take actions inside a company’s software and automate aspects of an employee’s workflow, could quickly grow unwieldy to track. A lack of clear oversight could also open businesses up to security breaches . Agent 365 is a way to manage all your bots, whether those agents were built with Microsoft’s tools or through a third-party platform. Agent 365’s core feature is a registry of an organization’s active agents all in one place, featuring specific identification numbers for each and details about how they are being used by employees. It’s also where you can change the settings for agents and what aspects of a business’s software each one has permission to access.

As talk of an AI bubble grows, the company is keen to stress that its latest release is more than just a clever model and chatbot—it’s a way of improving Google’s existing products, including its lucrative search business, starting today. “We are the engine room of Google, and we're plugging in AI everywhere now,” Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind, an AI-focused subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told WIRED in an interview ahead of the announcement. Hassabis admits that the AI market appears inflated, with a number of unproven startups receiving multibillion-dollar valuations. Google and other AI firms are also investing billions in building out new data centers to train and run AI models, sparking fears of a potential crash. But even if the AI bubble bursts, Hassabis thinks Google is insulated. The company is already using AI to enhance products like Google Maps, Gmail, and Search. “In the downside scenario, we will lean more on that,” Hassabis says. “In the upside scenario, I think we've got the broadest portfolio and the most pioneering research.” Google is also using AI to build popular new tools like NotebookLM , which can auto-generate podcasts from written materials, and AI Studio which can prototype applications with AI. It’s even exploring embedding the technology into areas like gaming and robotics, which Hassabis says could pay huge dividends in years to come, regardless of what happens in the wider market. Google is making Gemini 3 available today through the Gemini app and in AI Overviews , a Google Search feature that synthesizes information alongside regular search results.

Binoculars are usually listed with two number specifications; for example, our top pick, the Nikon Monarch M5 are 8x42 binoculars. Here's what that means: The number 8 refers to the magnification power . Objects seen through these binoculars will be eight times bigger than when you look with your naked eye. Newcomers should stick with 6X or 8X. They have enough power that you'll see things clearly, but they don't magnify so much that you'll struggle to find what you want to see or have trouble following fast-moving objects (though all binoculars take some practice). The 42 refers to the size of the front lens in millimeters . The larger the front lens (also called the objective lens), the more light reaches your eye. That means the image will be bigger, brighter, and clearer. A pair of 8x42 binoculars should be significantly brighter and offer a better viewing experience than a pair of 8x32 binoculars, even though both provide the same magnification. But the larger you get, the more glass they will use—so they'll weigh more. The weight difference between an 8x32 pair and a 10x42 pair is significant if you're wearing them all day.

The result is a sprawling exposure of personal information for a significant fraction of the world population. One group of Austrian researchers have now shown that they were able to use that simple method of checking every possible number in WhatsApp's contact discovery to extract 3.5 billion users’ phone numbers from the messaging service. For about 57 percent of those users, they also found that they could access their profile photos, and for another 29 percent, the text on their profiles.

Your only job as a parent is to nurture their creativity … and clean up the mess afterward. Between us—WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson, editor Adrienne So, and I—we have seven kids. This, honestly, is the most fun part of my job—calling in STEM toys for my kids and me to test together and recommend to you. It hardly feels like work at all. Wrap up a few of these STEM toys (also called STEAM toys; we love you too, arts!) and books for your future scientist to bake, squish, or dismantle. Hopefully, they'll thank you for the early encouragement when they're older.

Updated November 2025: We've added Qubitunes, Linkki, and Tosy. Qubs Amazon We’re in love with this screen-free play stage and speaker for kids . The cute wooden design includes a slot to insert a cartridge and a circular sound stage divided into four sections where you can pop characters on top to change the audio it plays. This basic functionality allows for a clever variety of add-on packs, from stories about quirky characters in the Groblies ($20) to a cooking game called Bernard’s Kitchen ($20) with different ingredients. My favorite is the Little Maestro set ($20) featuring players in an orchestra covering Mozart, Vivaldi, Beethoven, and Bach. The stereo speakers are quite good, it has a headphone port, and the Qubitunes can be recharged via USB-C for up to six hours of play. My wife has this in the reward area of her classroom, and it’s the most popular option with 7 and 8-year-olds. —Simon Hill For kids aged 3 years and up.

Here’s how to choose between the Bartesian and Barsys cocktail machines.", "content": "The machine on my kitchen table is a holy device, if your definition of “holy” is that it looks like a glowing halo and it’s filled with spirits. The machine has taken up a task I consider sacred: making me a cocktail. In advance of holiday party season, I have been testing a pair of devices that promise an indulgent future, a life where machines can make you a passable old-fashioned. The best-known cocktail machine on the market is almost certainly the Bartesian, the easy-peasy Keurig of cocktail makers. The circular device on my table is the Barsys 360, a Day-Glo device with a bit more flair for the dramatic. Right now the Barsys is making me an Oaxaca old-fashioned, but it could have been any of literally 2,000 other drinks, if I only had the ingredients. Among “Oaxaca” drinks alone we potentially also have a “Flower,” a “Gold,” and a “Tail.” The Barsys promises nearly 50 takes on an old-fashioned, and more than 70 versions of the mule. (A third cocktail machine option, the Bev by Black + Decker , uses Bartesian’s capsules with a different device design. It is likely being discontinued according to reps, but is still available on Amazon .) It’s all very ridiculous, my friends assure me, when I send them videos of the Barsys aggressively spitting ingredients into a glass whose magnetic bottom spins the liquid inside into an icy, frothy whirlpool. “I am embarrassed to be watching this,” wrote my editor at WIRED. “That is so dumb,” echoed a friend, before adding, “You should definitely bring it over.” No one really needs a machine to make a decent cocktail, of course. But you might want one anyway. I have a theory, the kind of big idea you hear sometimes in small bars. The promise of an automatic cocktail machine is not ease, nor necessity, nor even usefulness. It is, instead, excitement. It is fun. It is whatever will make today different from yesterday.

On this episode of The Big Interview podcast, Odd Lots cohost Joe Weisenthal breaks down why AI’s impact on finance goes beyond billion-dollar investments.", "content": "If you read any of WIRED’s recent AI edition , you know that lots of people are spending lots of time talking about how the technology is revolutionizing pretty much everything—from coding to writing to accounting. You’ve also probably heard by now, from us or somebody else, that we might very well be in an economic bubble of AI origin , one wherein the billions and billions of dollars being funneled into the industry is creating an untenable economic scenario that could turn catastrophic. Of course, you may also have read that I’m really sick of being asked about AI . I’m still not sick, though, of asking other people about it—especially when they’re much smarter about this stuff than I am. Enter Joe Weisenthal, the cohost of Bloomberg’s fantastic Odd Lots podcast and a former coworker of mine. Trust me: As someone who spent a year listening to Joe lose his mind in the office—loudly!—anytime the economy hiccuped, few people think more about our country’s, and our planet’s, financial circumstances than Joe does. And right now, Joe’s concerns aren’t strictly about what happens if or when that AI bubble bursts. His worries are more focused on what’s going right and wrong with the US economy writ large. For this week’s episode of The Big Interview , Joe and I talked about weird market indicators, US competition with China, and whether or not we should all prepare for an AI economic apocalypse. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Joe Weisenthal, welcome to The Big Interview . JOE WEISENTHAL: Thrilled to be here. Nice to see you again. It's been too long. We were just talking about how you and I worked together—what was that, like nine years ago? I think you were there 2014, 2015, so maybe 10 years ago or something? Yeah, I worked at Bloomberg.

It’s not just a dual-ended vibrator , offering up G-spot stimulation on one end and clitoral stimulation on the other, but it also features something you don’t see every day: a pussy pump . It's not the friendliest-looking sex toy. Unlike traditional vibrators that can be easily categorized as wands or rabbits, the suction cup and the flicking tongue make it look like nothing else that came before. But who cares if it looks like a probe from a sci-fi flick—does it do the job? First up: the vibrating dildo. It’s here you’ll find five extremely powerful vibration intensities packed into the textured shaft, ideal for G-spot or P-spot stimulation. Because this part of the toy also doubles as an ergonomic handle, it has some weight to it and is more girthy than many internal vibrators. That allows the G-spot stimulator to cover more area, making those rumbles feel more intense than they normally would. I typically like stronger vibrations, but I didn’t feel the need to turn things up past the third level on the Lick to find the sweet spot. Le Wand Lick 3-in-1 Rechargeable Double-Ended Vibrator Rating: 8/10 When you flip the Lick around, things look more complicated—especially if you’re new to suction play—but if you take your time to understand these features, you’ll be a happy camper. On this end, you have a suction cup and a tongue-shaped clitoral stimulator. Remove the cup—just a quick twist and it’s off—you can easily access the flicking tongue. The tongue has three speeds that, with a bit of water-based lube , are meant to mimic the sensation of oral sex. It didn’t feel much like oral sex to me, which probably says more about my partners than the Lick, but it felt great against my clitoris. So much so that this was my favorite function of the Lick. However, I want to stress the importance of lube .

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency. HDFCLI is being very selective in tier-2/3 cities and is focusing only on top quartile of customers, based on various filters. Outlook HDFC Life (HDFCLI) has successfully worked its way to improve bancassurance as well as agency while focusing on SURU markets (semi-urban and rural) in FY24. This has led to 13% YoY growth in tier 2/3 locations while overall NoP has grown 11% YoY in FY24.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

His defense claims the case is vindictive, influenced by Trump.", "content": "The prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey encountered a new hurdle on Wednesday (November 19) as the Justice Department acknowledged a potential procedural error in how the case was presented to a federal grand jury. The issue arose during a hearing where Comey’s attorneys asked US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff to dismiss the case, claiming the government’s actions were vindictive and improperly influenced by President Donald Trump. Comey’s lawyer, Michael Dreeben, argued that the failure to present the final two-count indictment to the full grand jury could be grounds for dismissal. “That would be tantamount to a bar of further prosecution in this case,” Dreeben told the court. US Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick had earlier reviewed a transcript of the grand jury proceedings and questioned whether all jurors saw the final indictment. Justice Department prosecutor Tyler Lemons confirmed that only two jurors, including the foreperson, were present when the revised indictment was submitted. James Comey, dismissed by President Donald Trump in 2017 and a longtime critic since, is seeking to have federal charges dismissed that stem from his 2020 testimony. He is among several individuals seen as Trump’s opponents who have faced recent investigations or indictments. Comey faces charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress, linked to sworn testimony about whether he authorized an FBI colleague to serve as an anonymous source to the news media. Comey has pleaded not guilty. Dreeben contended that the indictment was influenced by political pressure from Trump. “The president’s use of the Department of Justice to bring a criminal prosecution against a vocal and prominent critic in order to punish and deter those who would speak out against him violates the Constitution,” he said. Trump had publicly demanded action against Comey, posting in September: “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation.

The defense lawyer for 49-year-old Serhii Kuznietsov said that his client would be turned over to German authorities within the next few days, after the Cassation Court rejected a final defense appeal. Defense lawyer Nicola Canestrini expressed confidence that his client would be acquitted at trial. The explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which carried Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea until Russia cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. They also damaged the parallel Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered into service, because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia went to war with Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Kuznietsov was detained on a European arrest warrant on Aug. 21 at a campground near the Adriatic coastal city of Rimini, where he was vacationing with his family. German prosecutors say that Kuznietsov organized and carried out the detonation of at least four bombs between 14 and 27 kilograms (around 31 to 62 pounds) at a depth of 70 to 80 meters (230 feet to 263 feet) in the Baltic Sea near the Danish island of Bornholm on Sept. 26, 2022, according to extradition documents.

The BLS will incorporate those payrolls figures into the November report, which is due in a couple of weeks, as it could not complete a calculation of the unemployment rate and some other key numbers. The Labour Bureau's ‘employment situation’ report usually comes out on the first Friday of the month. This month, the report got delayed due to the government shutdown , which affected data collection. The September jobs report was originally due on October 3. It will now be out on Thursday. The job report, which measures job creation, wages and other measurements of the labor market , is composed of two surveys: — A survey of households that is used to determine the unemployment rate, among other things. — The ‘establishment' survey of companies, nonprofits and government agencies that is used. Last week, the advocacy group Friends of BLS, which is led in part by two of the agency’s former commissioners, told Bloomberg that because of the long shutdown, October 2025 will permanently remain a partial blind spot in America’s official record. “In some cases, BLS will be unable to retroactively collect consistent information about Americans’ experiences during this period.” Wednesday's announcement means the September jobs numbers will likely get extra scrutiny Thursday.

The latest data represents the narrowest gap as compared to $58.3 billion in October 2023. It marks a 24 per cent fall from the $78.2 billion deficit seen in July.  The notable contraction was primarily driven by a 5.1 per cent decline in imports, the largest dip in four months, while exports rose marginally 0.1 per cent, the BEA reported. The data arrives in the context of the far-reaching tariffs announced by President Donald Trump in April on ‘Liberation Day’ and subsequently expanded in August. These actions raised the effective tariff rate imposed by the US to 18 per cent. The tariffs implementation was twice paused until 1 August. Trump signed an executive order setting revised rates for 68 countries and the European Union, with some of his original levies adjusted following agreements with nine countries.  The Atlanta Federal Reserve currently anticipates that the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will increase by 4.2 per cent in the third quarter, with exports predicted to contribute up to 0.78 percentage points of that growth. This follows a 3 per cent rise in GDP during the second quarter, which exceeded a Dow Jones consensus of 2.3 per cent, a period where both exports and imports fell, as reported by Forbes. The report on the August trade deficit was delayed by over a month due to the recent government shutdown , which concluded last week. The BEA has yet to confirm a release date for the September data.

She welcomed her first child at 36 and is now expecting twins at 39. “Throughout my journey, I have given equal importance to building my career and nurturing my marriage, because a happy, stable environment matters deeply when raising a family,” Upasana posted. “For me, marriage and career are not competing priorities - they are equally meaningful parts of a fulfilled life. But I decide the timeline! That's not privilege, it's my right!!!” she added. While sharing the post, she wrote, “I’m happy to have sparked a healthy debate & thank you for your respectful responses. Stay tuned as I voice my opinions on the pleasures/pressures of privilege - that u all have been talking about.” Upasana Kamineni Konidela’s clarification comes after the outrage over her comments at IIT Hyderabad . “The biggest insurance for women is to save your eggs because then you can choose when to get married, when you want to have kids on your own terms when you are financially independent,” she said while hosting a session.

In a post on Truth Social, the US President posted a link to a Fox News article from August which was titled 'President of peace': Trump tapped for Nobel Prize amid talks to end Russia-Ukraine war — when the House Representatives Andy Ogles of Tennessee and Marlin Stutzman — urged the Nobel Committee for the most serious consideration of Trump for the Peace Prize. Trump, who has repeated his claim that he has solved several wars since his return to office in January, reshared the post amid the Trump administration reportedly quietly working out a new peace plan with Russia to end its war with Ukraine. In a letter, the representative stated that Trump's decisive leadership in securing landmark diplomatic agreements, de-escalating global conflicts, and actively pursuing peaceful resolutions to some of the world’s most entrenched disputes has led and continues to lead to a more peaceful world. This year, the president, who repeatedly insisted he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize , missed out on his chance as Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado won it. Ahead of the peace prize announcement, Trump had said that not winning the Nobel would be a big insult to our country. “I will tell you that. I don't want it, I want the country to get it.” A few months ago, Trump also got nominated by Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet during his trip to the country. Whereas, new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had told the US President that she was nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize.

In an interaction with the BBC, Pichai was asked about the H1-B crackdown by the US government, to which he replied, \"If you look at the history of technology development, the contribution of immigrants to the sector has been nothing but phenomenal.\" “I think the government understands it. I think there's a framework by which we all can still bring our talented individuals, and I think they're making changes to address some of the shortcomings in the current programme, and I think we'll be able to continue investing,” Pichai added. Notably, ever since the return of Donald Trump to power in the US, there has been a resurgence of \"America First\" immigration policies and growing fear that there could be drastic changes in the H1-B policy that could impact highly skilled professionals and students from countries like India, China and the Philippines. Some US lawmakers have even proposed legislation to completely end the H1-B visa programme or drastically reduce the number of applicants accepted. Meanwhile, there has been stricter scrutiny of visas and a suspected higher denial rate. The US administration has also hiked the H1-B visa fee paid by employers to $100,000, up from the previous fee of around $2,000 to $5,000.

Steyer, 68, announced his candidacy on Wednesday (November 19) through a video released on YouTube and a post on X. “I’m running for governor because Californians deserve a life they can afford,” Steyer wrote on X. “Sacramento politicians are afraid to change this system. I’m not.”  Steyer launched his 2026 California governor campaign with a strikingly populist message—one that targets the ultrawealthy, despite being among them himself. In his campaign ad, Steyer criticizes America’s richest individuals for exploiting the system and benefiting at the expense of ordinary Californians. “The richest people in America think that they earned everything themselves,” Steyer says in the video . “Bullshit, man. That’s so ridiculous. They come here to rip off the people of California and think they’re going to get away with it.” Steyer built his fortune after founding Farallon Capital Management in San Francisco in 1986, growing it into a multibillion-dollar hedge fund. In 2012, he stepped away from the firm to focus entirely on political and philanthropic work. “I wanted to build a business here. Now, it’s worth billions of dollars. And I walked away from it because I wanted to give back to California,” he said in his announcement video. Although he has never held elected office, Steyer is one of the most influential Democratic donors in the country.

He became a national figure during his 2020 presidential run, spending more than $340 million before dropping out after a weak showing in South Carolina.

New Delhi: Budgetary support for the Indian Railways is poised to hit a new high in 2026-27 as the government prepares an ambitious plan to upgrade the national transporter with faster, modern trains and better safety systems, two people aware of the matter told Mint . Capital expenditure is expected to rise about 12% next year to roughly ₹ 2.76 trillion, which would be the highest-ever allocation for the Indian Railways, the people said. Indian Railways operates with a two-pronged financial structure: its capex is primarily funded by the Union budget, while its operational expenses are mostly met through its own internal revenues. The planned increase comes on the heels of unusually rapid spending this year, with the railways having exhausted more than 78% of its 2025-26 budget as of mid-November. This is its highest mid-year utilization on record, underscoring the pace at which large projects have moved to execution. “An allocation in the range of ₹ 2.76 trillion will be a new high, but it’s in line with the scale of projects already underway, from dedicated freight corridors and higher-speed routes to a full overhaul of rolling stock,\" said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity. “The railways has now asked the ministry of finance for a further step-up in FY27, after allocations remained flat for the past two years,\" this person added. Budgetary support for the railways held steady at about ₹ 2.52 trillion in both FY25 and FY26 as the Centre balanced fiscal consolidation with competing expenditure pressures. But a surge in project execution has altered its plans.

In an interview with Fox Business, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) participants will need to reapply for benefits in an effort to prevent fraud. \"SNAP is a broken program. SNAP is full of corruption,\" she told CNN. SNAP provides monthly benefits — averaging around $190 per person — to about 42 million people nationwide.

Each account would be seeded with $1,000 from the US Treasury, with parents able to contribute up to $5,000 annually. Bessent explained, “One of the things that's going to happen next year is the start of ‘Trump accounts’ to save for kids.” President Trump indicated that the $2,000 checks could start going out in mid-2026 . “It will be next year. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend. We’re going to do a dividend and we’re also going to be reducing debt,” he said aboard Air Force One en route to Mar-a-Lago. Bessent cautioned that legislation would be required to actually authorize the payments , which remains uncertain. An estimate suggests the program could cost as much as $450 billion. Bessent said the administration is considering limiting the dividend to households earning under $100,000 . “Well, there are a lot of options here that the president’s talking about a $2,000 rebate and those — that would be for families making less than, say, $100,000,” he told Fox & Friends previously. He added that no final decision has been made: “We haven’t.

AP in another report said that American think-tank, the Center for American Progress (CAP) on 18 November confirmed that Summers was “ending his fellowship at CAP.” A spokesperson for the Budget Lab at Yale also told AP that Summers is no longer a member of the organization's advisory group. “ Larry has decided to resign from the OpenAI Board of Directors, and we respect his decision. We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,” the board said in a statement. A statement was also issued by Summers' spokesperson, Kelly Friendly a day earlier, which said: “In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI . I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress.” According to a Bloomberg report, Summers statement also said that he was “deeply ashamed” of continuing to communicate with Epstein.

Before signing an executive order in March 2025, Trump said that they have to get their children educated. “We’re not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven’t for a long time.” US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that the administration is taking bold action to break up the federal education bureaucracy and return education to the states. The functions that the department currently performs would go to the Labor, State, Interior, Health and Human Services departments. The six new interagency agreements (IAAs) with the four departments will streamline federal education activities on the legally required programs, reduce administrative burdens, and refocus programs and activities to better serve students and grantees, said the education department said in a statement. “Together, we will refocus education on students, families, and schools – ensuring federal taxpayer spending is supporting a world-class education system,” said Linda McMahon.

This year, it’s the 108th birthday for the former prime minister. Here are 10 little-known facts about the Iron Lady of India. Indira Gandhi showed her early nationalism in a striking way. She came to know that her favourite dolls had come from Britain. She built a small bonfire and burned them. The act upset her deeply, yet she remained firm because she wanted to protest the import of foreign goods. At just 12, Indira Gandhi formed a youth resistance group called the Vaanar Sena. It was inspired by the mythological army that helped Shree Ram. The group included thousands of children. They supported the freedom movement by carrying messages, putting up posters and running errands. They also secretly moved important documents past British police, who rarely suspected kids. Indira Gandhi spent a year studying at Visva-Bharati University in Shantiniketan. During this time, Rabindranath Tagore , the Nobel-winning poet who founded the institution, is believed to have given her the name Priyadarshini, meaning “beautiful to behold”. Indira Gandhi was mocked as “Gungi Gudiya” or “dumb doll” by political opponents like Ram Manohar Lohia. It was when she first became Prime Minister and was expected to be a puppet. She later proved them wrong by asserting strong leadership and building her own political authority. Indira Gandhi, despite her public secular image, was personally devoted to Shiva. She is believed to have chanted the Gayatri Mantra and practised yoga every morning. Spirituality was once an integral part of her daily routine. Indira Gandhi secretly approved India’s first nuclear test , called Smiling Buddha , in 1974. Only a few close advisers were aware of the plan. Even the Defence Minister was reportedly informed later. The successful test marked India’s entry into the group of nuclear-armed nations. Indira Gandhi reportedly believed that the CIA wanted to assassinate her after India’s 1971 war vict", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/indira-gandhi-s-birthday-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-iron-lady-of-india-gungi-gudiya-shiva-devotee-and-more-11763552779196.html", "timestamp": 1763594466.9778337}

According to a report by 8 News Now, officers found Anunay Sood's dead body in a room at the Wynn Las Vegas on 6 November. Police also found narcotics in the room along with Sood’s body, reported the outlet. Sood was in Las Vegas for the Las Vegas Concours 2025, a car show, according to posts on his Instagram account. A woman who was staying with Sood told police that around 4 am that day, she and Sood had purchased what they believed was cocaine from a man on the casino floor. She said that she, Sood, and another woman used the substance and then fell asleep. When the two women woke up about an hour later, they found Sood unresponsive, mentioned the report by 8 News Now. Officers reportedly also found a small bag with an unknown white substance in the hotel room and other evidence that the group snorted the powder. Anunay Sood featured in Forbes India’s Top 100 Digital Stars list for three consecutive years—2022, 2023 and 2024.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated.
