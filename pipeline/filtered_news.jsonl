The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers.

Other Backward Classes (OBCs) reservation continues to remain at 32 per cent, which takes over all reservations in the state to 56 per cent. The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters. The government had earlier argued that halting ongoing recruitments would disrupt administrative functioning due to manpower shortages. The petitions also contend that the increased reservation breaches the", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/karnataka-hc-restricts-fresh-recruitment-under-states-enhanced-sc-st-quota-law-10397327/", "timestamp": 1764800843.3734515}

As mandated under NEP-2020 , the SSSA will oversee separation of regulatory, academic, examination and administrative functions, and will be entrusted with responsibilities related to standard setting, monitoring and ensuring compliance with norms concerning safety, infrastructure, teacher qualifications, governance and financial probity. The order also takes note of the recommendation of PARAKH – the national assessment centre under NCERT – which suggests that state examination boards be designated as SSSAs to ensure equivalence of standards across different school boards. Several boards, including the CBSE at the national level, and the boards of Himachal Pradesh and Mizoram, have already been notified as SSSAs by the respective governments.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season.

In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost. A recent report by The Indian Express shows that 93 per cent of London businesses say international talent helps address skills shortages, and 84 per cent believe internatio", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indian-students-highest-cohort-leaving-united-kingdom-immigration-rule-limits-intake-ons-data-10390931/", "timestamp": 1764800851.2862713}

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021.

At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

Out of 720 marks, a massive 360 marks come from Biology alone. That’s half the paper, making it the most decisive and scoring subject in the exam. But here’s the truth: Biology isn’t just about memorising lines from a textbook. It’s about understanding life itself. And when you truly understand it, cracking NEET becomes much easier. NEET UG 2026 Physics Preparation Tips to Score 180 Marks Biology beautifully unfolds into two fascinating branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany lets you explore the world of plants, their structure, diversity, colours, and the incredible processes that keep our environment balanced. It helps you understand how genes pass from one generation to another and how biotechnology enhances human life. NEET UG 2026 Chemistry Preparation Tips Zoology brings you closer to the inner workings of living beings, such as respiration, blood circulation, and reproduction. It’s a deep dive into how the human body maintains harmony every single second. Together, these branches not only help you score well but also allow you to appreciate how life thrives in every form around you. If you want to master NEET Biology, strategy matters as much as study hours. Here’s how you can prepare smartly: –Make NCERT your foundation. It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly. Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly.

In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts.

Maybe not entirely, but Amazon is already making big bucks trying.", "content": "Can any company, big or small, really topple Nvidia’s AI chip dominance? Maybe not. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those that can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week. As expected, the company announced during the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is four times faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip. He said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.” Bedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models. Jassey said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there in the market. That is, of course, Amazon’s classic MO , offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices. Additionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight, in an interview with CRN , about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic. “We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said. Project Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October.

With CEOs from Ford and Stellantis in attendance, President Donald Trump proposed rolling back fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. The regulation change also reclassifies crossovers as cars instead of light trucks, and it eliminates automakers’ ability to trade electric vehicle credits. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates fuel economy rules under Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. Those rules, first enacted by Congress in 1975, dictate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations. Trump also said he would authorize the Department of Transportation to allow automakers to manufacture “really small cars” like the kind found in Japan and South Korea. The White House claims that existing regulations would have caused automotive prices to increase by $1,000 per vehicle. The previous Trump administration made the same argument in 2020, when it last rolled back fuel economy standards. Since that rollback, though, the price of a new vehicle has climbed to new heights , topping $50,000 on average, as automakers discontinued low-end models to capitalize on consumers’ preferences for SUVs. Larger vehicles use more material , thus costing more to make, while also getting lower fuel economy. Consumers’ choices appear to run counter to the administration’s contention that lower fuel economies are in the car-buying public’s interests. For instance, hybrid sales are up significantly this year over last and momentum continues. Hybrid sales grew 6% in October over the previous month.

At the company’s annual “ State of the Word ” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among examples. Telex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website. While the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. In the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something that a developer used to have to custom build but could now be created in a few seconds. In another demo, a developer used Telex to add real-time store hours, a phone number, and a link to get directions to the header block of their WordPress site.

The company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. However, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.” Even so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” This approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance. Kingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically. “Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners. This early aggressive funding contrasts with the last investment cycle. “The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures.

Anticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.” The company’s use of the expression “ end-to-end encryption ” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. By reading Kohler’s privacy policy , it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. Using the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. A Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.” The security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.” The Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.

This is the final StrictlyVC event of 2025 , and truly, the lineup is ridiculous. The series has traveled around the globe under the auspices of TechCrunch: Steve Case rented a theater in Washington, D.C.; we talked to Greece’s prime minister in Athens; and Kirsten Green hosted us at the Presidio in San Francisco. The concept is always the same, though: Bring together people who are working on genuinely important developments in a smaller setting, before everyone else figures out they’re important. One of our favorite moments was when, in 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed. He wasn’t joking . This time, we’ve got Nicholas Kelez , a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition chasing after the same prize . Then there’s Mina Fahmi , who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and turns them into text . Before you roll your eyes, know that he and co-founder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired.

Details of the cyberattack emerged this week after Marquis filed data breach notices with several U.S. states confirming its August 14 incident as a ransomware attack. Texas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States. At least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed. Texas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people. Marquis said in its notice with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state. The number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states. Marquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers. According to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a zero-day , meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers.

AWS announced new capabilities in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI at its AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers. The cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch. To access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview. “If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said. This capability is available for customizing Amazon’s own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama. AWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish. Frontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year’s conference.

Everything to know about Eventbrite’s acquirer", "summary": "Bending Spoons remains largely unknown, even as its portfolio of products has served more than a billion people.", "content": "Milan-based tech conglomerate Bending Spoons this week acquired Eventbrite for $500 million, adding the event ticketing platform to its growing portfolio of recognizable consumer tech brands. The deal, announced Tuesday, marks the latest acquisition for the 12-year-old company that has quietly become one of the tech industry’s most prolific buyers — despite remaining largely unknown to the general public. So what exactly is Bending Spoons? Despite its catchy name, the company has stayed remarkably under the radar, and it typically makes headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — which now includes Evernote, WeTransfer, Meetup, and StreamYard, among others. But Bending Spoons isn’t a traditional private equity firm or a pure financial investment vehicle. Its focus is on acquiring underperforming but popular tech brands, then transforming them to serve millions of users more efficiently. The company tends to make news when it restructures these acquired companies, often through significant layoffs , or makes controversial changes to beloved products — as it did with both Evernote and WeTransfer. Still, Bending Spoons remains largely unknown, even though its roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here’s what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet’s most recognizable brands. Bending Spoons describes itself as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 employees (whom the company calls “Spooners”), its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created. However, it didn’t start that way — Bending Spoons’ founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus. The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/", "timestamp": 1764801156.9089522}

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) said Tuesday that Republican leaders would look for “other places” to include the measure — an effort that President Trump has supported — according to The Hill . The proposal to preempt states from enacting their own AI regulation came months after GOP lawmakers sought to include a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws in Trump’s tax and spending bill earlier this year. The provision failed then due to strong resistance from both parties. Silicon Valley has supported such measures, arguing that state regulations create an unworkable patchwork of rules that could stymy innovation. Critics argue that most state AI legislation is focused on safety, transparency, and consumer protections, and in the absence of federal AI laws that perform those tasks, blocking states from regulating would be effectively handing over control to Big Tech with no oversight. Scalise reportedly acknowledged that the defense bill was not the place to include such a provision, and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as a separate bill. A leaked draft executive order signals Trump is considering taking matters into his own hands, though those efforts have reportedly paused for now. Topics Tonight!

Like other annual reviews, the Google Photos Recap lets you look back on your past year in photos, offering a combination of memorable highlights enhanced with graphics and other effects, plus photo stats and more. U.S. users will also gain access to a new feature powered by Google’s AI, Gemini, which will showcase your hobbies and other top highlights, the company says. First introduced in 2024, Google Photos Recap aims to capitalize on the data-powered review trend, popularized by services like Spotify Wrapped, and, in past decades, by time-traveling apps like Timehop . However, this year, the Google Photos Recap also serves as a testing ground for Gemini, as the company unleashes the AI on your photo archive to help surface more of the moments you might like to review. Google says that Gemini models can understand the context of your photos to pull out more details. Specifically, the models were used to identify things like your “one true passion” and the other top four highlights that “made your year” in the Recap. In addition, the recap will offer photo stats from the year, like total photo count, top people, and, new for this year, a total selfie count. The feature also now lets you hide specific people or photos. After doing so, you can then regenerate your Recap for an updated version. The photos and memories from the Recap can be easily shared on social media and elsewhere. A new integration with CapCut will add a button at the end of the Recap to export it to the photo and video editing app, where you can use other Google Photos templates to customize the Recap further. There’s also a new carousel at the end of the Recap containing short videos, photos, and collages designed for sharing to group chats or social media.

That includes driverless taxi rides, sure, but also headier ideas like sending an autonomous vehicle to fetch groceries or pick up dry cleaning. If those things are ultimately going to happen, navigating the handoff moments — like where exactly a vehicle should stop to receive the groceries — will be a crucial piece of the puzzle. Palo Alto-based Autolane is trying to build that layer of infrastructure, and it now has $7.4 million in fresh funding to take on that goal. Backed by VC firms like Draper Associates and Hyperplane, Autolane said it will start by coordinating pickup and drop-off points for companies that want to let robotaxis come onto their private property. The startup has signed a deal with Simon Property Group to coordinate driverless vehicle arrivals and departures at shopping centers owned by the real estate company in Austin, Texas and San Francisco, California. This deal will include creating simple, physical infrastructure like signage (think: the many kinds of Uber and Lyft pickup and drop-off stanchions that decorate modern hotels and airports) and also software. “I believe we are one of the first, let’s say, ‘application layer’ companies in autonomy,” Autolane co-founder and CEO Ben Seidl told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. “We aren’t the fundamental models. We’re not building the cars. We’re not doing anything like that. We are simply saying, as this industry balloons rapidly and has exponential growth — as is already occurring this year and will occur for the next 10 years straight — someone is going to have to sit in the middle and orchestrate, coordinate, and kind of evaluate what’s going on.” Autolane is starting with robotaxis in mind, but Seidl is clearly focused on the bigger-picture idea of applying his company’s tech to all kinds of tasks au", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/autolane-is-building-air-traffic-control-for-autonomous-vehicles/", "timestamp": 1764801159.1904583}

The company announced Wednesday it has begun testing its autonomous vehicles (with a safety monitor) in Philadelphia, and that it will start manual driving to collect data in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh. Waymo did not offer a timeline for when it plans to launch commercial services in those locations, nor do we know whether the Alphabet-owned company will partner with other companies to operate robotaxis in each one. That has been the move in cities like Atlanta and Austin, for example, where Waymo has partnered with Uber to advance its robotaxi rollout. But the new locations join a list of over 20 cities where the company is either offering rides, prepping a commercial launch, or testing. Waymo is also now offering rides on freeways in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The company plans to be doing one million rides per week by the end of 2026. Waymo has done all this while claiming to be operating at a level five times safer than humans, according to data the company recently released. But the expansion has not come without its issues. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating how the company’s vehicles operate near school buses, after a Waymo was filmed driving around a stopped bus in Atlanta in September. This week, Austin news outlet KXAN published a report showing Waymo’s vehicles have driven past school buses that were in the process of unloading or loading children multiple times — including after Waymo claims to have shipped software updates to address the problem.

After last year’s widely criticized flop that included an AI podcast as its highlight, the streamer’s highly anticipated annual review feature has returned to its roots. This year, Spotify is doubling down on what it knows works best: deep dives into your streaming data, creative experiences, messages from favorite artists, and other social features. The company claims that Wrapped 2025 is its biggest, as it’s introducing nearly a dozen new features in addition to its old standbys, like top songs and artists. Plus, it’s offering more visibility into users’ data than in years past. For the first time, Spotify Wrapped is adding a live multiplayer feature to compare your listening data with friends. Wrapped Party, Wrapped’s first live interactive experience, allows you to invite up to nine friends to compare listening stats. Also new this year, your Top Songs Playlist will include the play counts for each of the top songs, so you can actually see how much time you spent with your favorite tracks. Other standout features this year include an interactive Top Song Quiz, a Listening Age feature, and Wrapped Clubs, which match you to one of six unique listening styles. The company believes these additions will not only bring back the personalized, engaging experience that users have long expected from Wrapped, but will take it a step further by making it more interactive than before. In the Top Song Quiz, for instance, you can try to guess which top song soundtracked your year before seeing the results. The new interactive Wrapped Party feature isn’t just about comparing the personal streaming data you’ve already received to your friends’ data, as that’s something people already do on social media.

The company said it has so far raised $8 million in total from over 8,000 people across two previous community investment rounds. It held its first community funding event in 2021, aiming to raise $1.5 million . “This isn’t about raising capital, it’s about giving our community/fans a chance to invest while we’re private and join us on the journey,” a spokesperson for Nothing told TechCrunch. Community investors have a rotating seat on the company’s board, but it is unclear what else they get for investing in the company through such rounds. Nothing raised $200 million in its Series C back in September from investors including Tiger Global, GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry. The company has raised $450 million to date. The community round comes as Nothing makes changes to its corporate structure as it tries to increase its share of a smartphone market dominated by giants like Samsung and Apple. The company is spinning off its budget CMF brand , and plans to explore AI-centric devices while it keeps building smartphones and audio products. And Nothing claims it crossed $1 billion in cumulative revenue this year, up 150% from 2024. The startup is working to be “IPO-ready” in three years, CEO Carl Pei told TechCrunch in an email. “The timing will depend on market conditions and what makes sense for the business at that point in time,” he said. “What’s important is that we’re already operating with that discipline now.

On Wednesday, the Indian telecom ministry said Sanchar Saathi, an anti-theft and cybersecurity protection app, would remain voluntary and that smartphone makers would no longer be required to preload it on devices they sell. The new notice effectively reverses a directive issued to manufacturers last week (and circulated online on Monday) that had instructed manufacturers to bake the app into all devices and prevent its features from being disabled. News of the mandate soon ignited concerns over privacy and state overreach. “Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, the government has decided not to make pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” the ministry said. However, the government has not yet issued an official notification to smartphone makers reflecting the withdrawal, and manufacturers are still waiting for formal instructions, two manufacturer sources involved with the proceedings told TechCrunch. Since its release in January 2025, Sanchar Saathi has so far been downloaded 14 million times and contributes information on roughly 2,000 cyber-fraud incidents per day, per the Indian government. The recent controversy boosted interest in the platform, and the ministry noted that about 600,000 citizens registered to download the app on December 2 alone. The telecom ministry’s notice follows much confusion over whether the app was truly voluntary, as the government claimed.

Digital rights advocates are pushing back against legislation they say will make the internet less safe.", "content": "Members of Congress considered 19 online safety bills Tuesday that may soon have a major impact on the future of the internet as age-verification laws have spread to half of the US and around the world . In response, digital and human rights organization Fight for the Future is hosting a week of events —across Reddit , LinkedIn, and various livestreams —to raise awareness of how it believes these bills are setting a dangerous precedent by making the internet more exploitative rather than safer. Many of the proposed bills include a clause for ID or age verification, which forces people to upload an ID, allow a face scan, or otherwise authenticate that they are not a minor before viewing adult content. Fight for the Future says the policies will lead to increased censorship and surveillance. Among the 19 bills considered at the hearing conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed with sweeping bipartisan approval in the Senate last year, and the Reducing Exploitative Social Media Exposure for Teens Act , which would ban tech companies from allowing minors under the age of 16 on their platforms. In addition to age verification, the bills raised concerns over issues of parental controls, consumer research of minors, AI, and data privacy. “We’re seeing this huge wave toward ID checks being the norm in tech policy, and it felt like we needed to capture the already activated communities who are not feeling heard in Congress,” says Sarah Philips, a campaigner with Fight for the Future. “If you look on YouTube, if you see people making content about KOSA or responding to a lot of this legislation, it’s very unpopular with people. But it’s viewed on the Hill as very common-sense.” Missouri’s age-gate law took effect earlier this week, meaning 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

This could have implications far outside gaming.", "content": "The video game Valorant , a fast-paced team-based shooter , has recently become a testing ground for a promising new direction in artificial intelligence research. The game’s developers at Riot Games (a Tencent subsidiary) are using 3D-native AI models to prototype new characters, scenes, and storylines, according to a researcher familiar with the company’s efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. While many AI models can generate text, images, and video, Tencent’s Hunyuan (混元 or “first mix”) family of models can dream up 3D objects and interactive scenes. The source says that Tencent’s models are also being used by the developers of another Tencent game, GKART , and by some independent developers, too. Tencent declined to comment. “The games industry requires a lot of investment,” the source says. “Previously you would need a month to design a character. Now you can just type in some text, and Hunyuan can give you four choices in 60 seconds.” The news is an early signal that models capable of understanding and re-creating the physical world could become a standard ingredient in game design. In addition to generating game content, these models could also enable more advanced virtual and augmented reality and help robots learn to do new things. “There’s a real explosion of 3D vision research nowadays,” says Alexander Raistrick , a graduate student at Princeton University working on novel approaches to generating 3D content. “There are many killer applications: There's content creation, there’s self driving, and there’s a whole stack of problems involved in augmented reality.” Raistrick adds that video games are an obvious application for 3D AI models. “Outputting 3D meshes [a standard way of representing 3D objects] is your typical kind of bread and butter of game development,” he says. But, as in other creative fields, using AI to create video games is controversial. Concerns about AI-fueled job loss loom large .

After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport . The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims. Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure. She says the call never came. This isn’t what’s supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home , which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug.

If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes. The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to autom", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/", "timestamp": 1764801164.8844829}

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says. One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit , which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform’s rules.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Melinda French Gates, welcome to The Big Interview . Thank you so much for being here. MELINDA FRENCH GATES: Thanks for having me, Katie.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine , Gavin Kliger , Marko Elez , Akash Bobba , and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment. The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers , consolidating data across agencies , and importing private sector practices —remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles. “That’s absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-doge-doing-now/", "timestamp": 1764801165.504039}

Updated December 1: We've added the Insta360 Flow 2 Pro Creator Bundle and Roborock Saros Z70. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

On that first Cyber Monday, people were not doing Excite and Lycos searches; they were listening to Madonna's “Hung Up” on the first iPod Nanos and then sending their first hesitant, wobbly text messages on their Motorola Razrs.

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change. Update: The $500 discount has sold out, however, you can still buy the Core Ultra 7 model for $650.

These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies. We haven't tested any of the below items—I might for my Gifts for Plant Lovers guide—but here are some other sales on interesting Vego items that might be worth checking out: • Raised Garden Bed Kit for $153 ($27 off) : OK, I might actually buy this myself.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room. Sony Amazon B&H An upgraded pick for the discerning ear, the Sony Bravia Theater System 6 is marked down by 25% on Amazon for Cyber Monday . This 5.1 surround system is helmed by an impressive soundbar in a surprisingly compact package, assisted by a chunky subwoofer and two surround speakers.

This one offered by Amazon , for example, is a Gorilla Tag bundle, which is currently the most popular game on the platform. It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played. For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR.

This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

Calling Biden's policies \"horrible\" and \"ridiculously burdensome\", Trump said, \"My administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs and make buying a car much more affordable for countless American families.\" Trump's announcement from the Oval Office came in the presence of Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa, and John Urbanic, plant manager at General Motors’ Orion, Michigan, facility. The proposal, if finalised next year, would ease regulatory pressure on automakers to control emissions from gasoline-powered trucks and cars in a reversal from the Biden administration's push towards cleaner-running vehicles. The Biden-era regulations required automakers to achieve a fuel efficiency of 50 miles per gallon across their 2031 model-year vehicles—the aim was to promote both energy efficiency and spur the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Trump's proposal seeks to lower that requirement to about 34.5 miles per for the 2031 model year, as per Bloomberg . The proposal, if finalised, would come as a major win for the auto and oil industry, which had pushed back against the Biden-era standards, arguing that the administration's demands pushed the limits of available technology. “As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Ford CEO Farley said, welcoming the move. Earlier, Trump had already signed legislation lifting penalties on automakers who failed to meet the present fuel economy standards.

According to the news outlet, the IG report concluded that sharing real-time operational details over Signal “could have endangered American troops and mission objectives.” However, the consequences of the disclosure remain unclear. The news outlet citing two sources stated that the IG acknowledged Hegseth has the authority to declassify information. Hegseth reportedly claimed he made “an operational decision in the moment” to share the plans — though investigators found no documentation of such a decision. An unclassified version of the IG report is expected to be released publicly on Thursday (December 4). The classified report was sent to Congress Tuesday night. Messages sent from Hegseth’s Signal account to a group chat included specific, real-time updates on planned US military strikes . It is still unclear whether Hegseth properly declassified the material before sharing it with top Trump officials — and a reporter, The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, who was accidentally added to the chat . The IG’s findings form part of a broader review into Hegseth’s use of the encrypted app. The report states Hegseth “should not have used Signal ” to transmit sensitive military information and that senior Defense Department officials require better training on information-handling protocols, the news outlet further stated, citing sources as saying. Beyond the potential operational risks, the IG also reportedly found that Hegseth had shared sensitive and classified details with unauthorized individuals.

This marked the first such attempt by a Chinese firm, as the country’s expanding commercial space sector seeks to compete with American companies like SpaceX, according to a report by CNN. The Beijing-based company successfully launched its Zhuque-3 rocket from a remote desert site in northwestern China. The rocket reached orbit as intended, but its first stage, the part that provides initial thrust, did not land successfully and instead crashed to the ground, the report said, citing the company. “An anomaly occurred after the first-stage engine ignited during the landing phase, preventing a soft landing on the designated recovery pad,\" the company was quoted as saying. “The debris landed at the edge of the recovery area, resulting in a failed recovery test.” The company said it would conduct a comprehensive review and continue to “advance the verification and application of reusable rocket technology in future missions,” the statement added. Watch video here —  Despite the current attempt being unsuccessful, the trial has positioned the company at the forefront of a group of Chinese firms competing to develop reusable rocket technology that Beijing hopes will boost its rivalry with international competitors. Reusable rockets are viewed as crucial because the technology can notably reduce the cost and turnaround time of rocket launches, a clear advantage as global companies compete to expand satellite networks and plan for a future space travel industry.

While federal officials insist the sweeps target violent offenders. A federal immigration crackdown began in New Orleans, with Homeland Security officials confirming the operation will focus on violent offenders. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the aim is to apprehend immigrants previously arrested for “home invasion, armed robbery and rape.” “These sweeps,” she said, “are targeting criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets.” The New Orleans operation expands the Trump administration’s mass deportation strategy already launched in cities such as Chicago and Charlotte , North Carolina. Another sweep is expected in Minnesota, targeting Somali immigrants. Since January, federal agents have conducted raids in both large and small communities. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a strong Trump ally, has been preparing for weeks. He said the operation will go after the “worst of the worst, criminal illegal aliens that have broken the law.” “It started today,” Landry said in a radio interview, “and it’s going to run until we get them all off the street.” The deployment comes amid ongoing tension in New Orleans over immigration, despite the city’s reliance on thousands of Latino workers in the years after Hurricane Katrina. Federal officials have repeatedly criticized New Orleans for what they describe as sanctuary-style policies. McLaughlin argued: “Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens.” Attorney General Pam Bondi also accused the city of undermining enforcement.

A new base year will be adopted from 27 February 2026, she added. Replying to the Lok Sabha debate on the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025, the minister said the IMF has recognized India’s macroeconomic stability and resilience and has projected 6.6% economic growth for 2025-26. IMF did not question India’s growth figures, Sitharaman said, adding that there is “no misleading data”. Her comments came after the opposition Congress party flagged the IMF’s data adequacy assessment of India’s national accounts following the release of the 8.2% gross domestic product (GDP) growth figure for the second quarter. The IMF’s assessment was part of the annual country report released on 26 November. The report noted that despite external headwinds, India’s growth is expected to remain robust, supported by favourable domestic conditions. “Under the baseline assumption of prolonged 50% US tariffs, real GDP is projected to grow at 6.6% in FY2025/26 before moderating to 6.2% in FY2026/27,” the IMF had said. Sitharaman clarified the IMF’s assessment after Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule raised the issue during the debate. The Lok Sabha on Wednesday approved the Central Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2025. “The debate was very ill informed. Most of IMF’s report focuses on India’s overall healthy economic performance,” the minister said. She explained that the IMF classifies data adequacy as A, B, C or D.

Phillippa, who serves the North Chili United Methodist Church, delivered the personal update from the pulpit during the Sunday service on 23 November, wearing a rainbow stole. “So I get to announce with joy that I’m transitioning,” the pastor said. “I’m affirming to all of you that I am transgender. The best way to put this is that I’m not becoming a woman, I’m giving up pretending to be a man. This is a process, and it may be shocking for some as to what this all means.”  In the same announcement, she shared that she identifies as asexual, a sexual orientation characterized by experiencing little or no sexual attraction to others. “I’m in the category of what they call asexual,” Phaneuf said. “I’ve been that way since we’ve all been together, in that I am not living my life in a way that involves looking for romance.” Phillippa confirmed that she has been undergoing hormone replacement therapy for the past three months and anticipates changes to her appearance, voice, and hair. The pastor reported that the transition is fully supported by the church and the bishop, who was consulted before the public announcement. Phillippa emphasized that her pastoral duties at the church will remain unaffected, stating that both the church's theology and leadership affirm her decision. She also noted that the broader community has been extremely welcoming.  “Since coming out to my congregation, they have been overwhelmingly affirming!” Phaneuf said. Despite institutional support, Phillippa's parents do not support her decision. “What will stay the same is my deepening love for all of you,” Phaneuf said. “They asked me to tell you all that they do not support me,” Phaneuf announced during the sermon. “They asked me to tell you this.” This announ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-methodist-pastor-announces-transition-into-woman-during-sermon-giving-up-pretending-to-be-a-man-11764769342753.html", "timestamp": 1764801216.1965723}

She shared a video on Instagram, expressing shock and dismay: “This was my first time flying Air India in a long time… after 15 or 17 years, this is the first time anything like this has happened to my instrument.” In her post, Shankar pointed out that she always travels with a hard, protective case and paid a handling fee for extra care — yet found her instrument damaged on arrival. “How have you done this? I have special cases, you charge a handling fee and yet you've done this?” she asked, underlining the emotional attachment she holds with her sitar. Shankar wrote in the caption that she was “devastated and truly disturbed” by what happened. She said it felt particularly painful because she chose to fly Air India after a long gap; “it seems an Indian instrument can’t be safe with them,” she lamented, adding that she has travelled on “thousands of flights” with other airlines without even a peg on her sitar going out of tune. Her revelation has reopened a long-standing debate over how airlines handle fragile musical instruments. Many Indian musicians have previously complained of damage or loss when travelling, especially on flights where instruments must be checked in as cargo rather than carried onboard. The post has sparked a wave of reactions from fellow musicians, fans and social-media users — many expressing solidarity and frustration. Comments under her post reflect anger and sympathy, with users calling the situation “unbelievable” and demanding accountability from the airline.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Even as India’s rural land-mapping has progressed substantially, most urban areas lack reliable, up-to-date maps and clear ownership data. This gap leads to land disputes, inefficient property transactions, poor municipal tax collection and delays in infrastructure planning. With over 600 million people expected to live in Indian cities by 2031, the central government implemented the NAKSHA (National Geospatial Knowledge-based Land Survey of Urban Habitations) programme to modernize and digitize India’s urban land records, which remain outdated, incomplete and often inaccurate. Once the pilot-phase survey of 157 urban local bodies, which started in February, is completed, the next phase will cover 1,000 cities, with all urban local bodies set to be surveyed within the next five years, Manoj Joshi, secretary in the Department of Land Resources, said on Wednesday. Mint explains the central government’s rationale behind implementing Naksha. What is the Naksha Programme and what does it aim to achieve? The Naksha programme leverages advanced technologies such as drone surveys, Global Navigation Satellite System mapping and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to build precise digital land records. Using cutting-edge aerial and field survey techniques, Naksha is building a comprehensive, GIS-integrated database of urban land plots. It aims to create and update urban land records to ensure accurate and reliable documentation of land ownership. Under this initiative, citizens will receive a government-backed UrPro (Urban Property Ownership Record) Card, a digital proof of ownership that simplifies property transactions. With Naksha, people no longer need to rely on piles of paper or intermediaries to validate ownership. Why is the central government implementing Naksha specifically in urban areas?

His remarks come amid political backlash over a recent directive mandating smartphone manufacturers to pre-install the app on all new and existing devices. The controversy began after a 28 November government order required all mobile phone makers to preload the state-run Sanchar Saathi safety app on every handset sold in India. The directive also mandated pushing the app to existing devices via software updates and ensuring that it is “readily visible and accessible to end users” upon first use. Opposition leaders and digital rights advocates criticised the mandate as a potential surveillance tool, claiming the app could monitor calls and messages. Some smartphone manufacturers — including Apple, according to industry sources — reportedly expressed reservations and sought discussions with the Centre, arguing that the order was impractical in its current form. Jyotiraditya Scindia categorically rejected the allegations during Question Hour in the Lok Sabha. “Sanchar Saathi app se na snooping sambhav hai, na snooping hoga,” he said, stressing that the app is designed solely for citizen protection. The Union minister added that the government’s objective is to empower users, not intrude on their privacy: “The government want to give power in the hands of the people to help them protect themselves.” Amid the escalating row, Scindia softened the Centre’s stance on compulsory installation, clarifying on Tuesday that users are not obliged to keep the app. “If you want to delete it, then delete it,” he told reporters outside Parliament.

Earlier in September 2025, former JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna has approached the Karnataka High Court appealing against his conviction in a rape case. A special court that convicted Prajwal Revanna last month had sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life and imposed fines, in one of the four sexual abuse and rape cases against him. The Special Court for MPs/MLAs, Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat, who sentenced the convicted politician under various sections of the IPC on August 2, had imposed a total fine of ₹ 11.50 lakh on him, and had said ₹ 11.25 lakh from this fine amount will be paid to the victim. Revanna, who was arrested in May last year after returning from Germany, is contesting the verdict on several grounds, including what he claims are contradictions in the survivor's testimony and inconsistencies in the evidence produced by the prosecution. The case in which Prajwalb Revanna has been sentenced pertains to the one involving 48-year-old woman who was working as a help at the family's Gannikada farmhouse in Hassan district's Holenarasipura. She was allegedly raped twice -- at Hassan farm house and Bengaluru residence-- in 2021 and the act was recorded by the accused on his mobile phone.

The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors.

While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.
