The order, issued by the General Administration Department, notes that the earlier schedule has been amended and the new date will apply to all government offices and schools across the state. Punjab and Haryana usually observe the holiday on November 24, but final announcements for 2025 are awaited. In Delhi, schools typically follow the gazetted holiday declared by the state government, which historically observes Shaheedi Diwas. However, no formal circular has been released yet for the 2025 calendar. Guru Tegh Bahadur Jayanti holds significant cultural and historical importance, marking the Guru’s sacrifice in 1675 while defending religious freedom during the Mughal era.

INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Out of 720 marks, a massive 360 marks come from Biology alone. That’s half the paper, making it the most decisive and scoring subject in the exam. But here’s the truth: Biology isn’t just about memorising lines from a textbook. It’s about understanding life itself. And when you truly understand it, cracking NEET becomes much easier. NEET UG 2026 Physics Preparation Tips to Score 180 Marks Biology beautifully unfolds into two fascinating branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany lets you explore the world of plants, their structure, diversity, colours, and the incredible processes that keep our environment balanced. It helps you understand how genes pass from one generation to another and how biotechnology enhances human life. NEET UG 2026 Chemistry Preparation Tips Zoology brings you closer to the inner workings of living beings, such as respiration, blood circulation, and reproduction. It’s a deep dive into how the human body maintains harmony every single second. Together, these branches not only help you score well but also allow you to appreciate how life thrives in every form around you. If you want to master NEET Biology, strategy matters as much as study hours. Here’s how you can prepare smartly: –Make NCERT your foundation. It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly. Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly.

In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763766792.8543394}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2.

This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process. The 2021 board exams were significantly delayed, starting on May 17 and ending on May 26. This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years. By 2023, the Telangana SSC exams returned closer to the usual time frame, being held from April 3 to April 13. The shorter, 11-day window helped the board align future sessions with the pre-pandemic calendar. The 2024 exams were conducted from March 18 to April 2, indicating a complete return to the standard March schedule. The examination period stretched over 16 days, giving students a familiar timetable after several disrupted years. For the 2025 session, the exams began on March 21 and concluded on April 4, continuing the trend of mid-March starts and early April endings.

The draft curriculum, which has been submitted to the NCERT for review, provides a structure for schools to introduce computational thinking and AI in a phased and progressive manner from classes 3 to 12.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion. European and East Asian universities are also in negotiations,” he said. As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared. Recognising that reading lengthy passages on screens differs from paper, test-makers deliberately reduced passage lengths.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council.

Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES).

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763766814.667584}

According to the earlier released tentative schedule, choice filling and locking were originally scheduled from 28th October to 5th November 2025 for the 50 per cent All India Quota (AIQ), 100 per cent Deemed/Central Universities, and AFMS institutions. The top court was hearing a batch of petitions raising various issues concerning the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test-Postgraduate exams, particularly focusing on the disclosure of answer keys as a matter of transparency. During the hearing, the NBE’s counsel submitted that these petitions are being pushed by coaching institutes seeking access to answer keys for question booklets, arguing that this would compromise the quality of the examination.

Earlier, on April 29, the apex court had directed the publication of raw scores, answer keys and normalisation formula for transparency. Previously, candidates had no access to answer keys or raw score details, leading to concerns about the fairness of the normalisation process.

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete. Germany’s medical qualification, the Staatsexamen is a six-year program conducted in German, requiring at least C1-level proficiency in the language. The curriculum combines rigorous academic study with clinical exposure at university-affiliated hospitals. Specialisations such as internal medicine, surgery, psychiatry, anesthesiology, and geriatrics are particularly sought after. This demand aligns with demographic trends, as it is projected that one in four Germans will be above 65 years of age by 2030, according to Germany’s Federal Statistical Office – the Statistisches Bundesamt , coupled with a shortfall of over 400,000 doctors in OECD count", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/neet-ug-germany-next-medical-education-destination-indian-aspirants-mbbs-study-abroad-10335243/", "timestamp": 1763766817.5012925}

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic.

I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Seven IITs, which feature in the top 10 among Indian institutions in the QS Asia Rankings 2026, have seen a significant fall in their ranks this year compared to last year.

READ MORE| India’s top IITs rank slip as universities from China, Singapore surge ahead in QS Asia Rankings 2026 The ranking of Asian universities, released on Tuesday, reflects an eastward concentration of top performance, QS said. Indian institutions retain strong reputations but face stiff competition from those in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, which are outperforming them on metrics like ‘citations per paper’, which is a measure of the impact of research, faculty-student ratio, and international student ratio. Reacting to the rankings, Prof Chakraborty said: “The QS rankings are one of several reference points in a very broad and complex global higher education ecosystem. A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/qs-world-rankings-asia-universities-2026-ranks-indian-institutes-drop-rank-iit-kharagpur-director-reacts-suman-chakraborty-10347239/", "timestamp": 1763766822.655349}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

The company’s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents. The startup’s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: “That’s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.” Sierra’s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM. Taylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra’s customers. The company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages — essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents. Sierra faces competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, but the company claims to be the leader in the AI customer service category. Sierra was last valued at $10 billion when it raised a $350 million round led by Greenoaks Capital in September. Other investors in the company include Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital. Based on its $100 million ARR, the Sierra is currently valued at a 100x revenue multiple, a hefty valuation despite its exceptionally fast growth. The startup employs an outcomes-based pricing model, charging customers for completed work rather than charging flat subscription fees.

Below, we’ve rounded up some of the most notable devices currently available. Bee is an affordable pendant priced at $49.99 that can either be clipped to your clothing or worn like a fitness band. This device records everything it hears and learns your routines and preferences to create reminders and notes for you. It even features a mute button for those times you want some privacy. The companion app (currently available only on iOS) is included with a $19 monthly subscription. The app allows you to interact with Bee directly and ask it questions. You can also get key takeaways from your day and chronological transcripts of your conversations. Amazon recently acquired the wearables startup in July. Friend is one of the most hyped entrants in the “personal AI” device market. This $129 white pendant hangs around your neck and functions as an emotional support companion. It recognizes your tone and mood, allowing you to chat with it as if it were a friend. It connects to your phone via Bluetooth and constantly listens, ready to respond or send you proactive messages, like wishing you good luck before an interview. However, it has also faced criticism, including a recent backlash against its subway ad campaign in NYC. People vandalized the ads, writing messages like “surveillance capitalism.” Formerly known as Rewind, Limitless is another conversation-recording pendant priced at $99.

A hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters published screenshots late Thursday and Friday morning in a public Telegram channel that allegedly showed insider access to CrowdStrike systems. The screenshots, which TechCrunch has seen , show dashboards containing links to company resources, including a user’s Okta dashboard used by employees for accessing internal apps. The hackers claimed in the Telegram channel to have compromised CrowdStrike through a recent breach at Gainsight , a customer relationship management company that helps Salesforce customers track and manage their own customers’ data. The hackers said they used information stolen from Gainsight to break into CrowdStrike. But CrowdStrike says the hackers’ claims are “false,” and says it terminated the insider’s access after the company “determined he shared pictures of his computer screen externally.” “Our systems were never compromised and customers remained protected throughout. We have turned the case over to relevant law enforcement agencies,” CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch. Several other tech companies were allegedly hacked as part of the same campaign. Gainsight did not respond to TechCrunch’s requests for comment. Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of hackers made up of several hacking groups, notably ShinyHunters , Scattered Spider , and Lapsus$ .

And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds. Nowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment. For instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.” The app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time. “Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.” Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days. Another notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page.

The shakeup eliminates the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, the Grid Deployment Office, and the Office of Federal Energy Management programs. On the other side of the ledger, the DOE has created a new Office of Fusion and merged geothermal and fossil fuels under the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office. Some of these moves will likely spur legal challenges, E&E News points out , given that at least one office caught up in the reorg, the OCED, was authorized by Congress under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “The authority of Cabinet secretaries to move around major functions and offices is very limited, especially when those offices were established and funded through congressional action. Congress has put tight handcuffs on reorganizations, and plans typically require either congressional approval or the opportunity for congressional review,” Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, told E&E News. The creation of the Office of Fusion was likely spurred to encourage commercialization of the technology. Previously, fusion fell under the Office of Science, which is focused on research rather than commercialization.

Livestreamers who watch SpaceX’s Starbase complex closely caught the explosion in the pre-dawn hours Friday, around 4:00 a.m. local time. Other creators in the area have since captured photos that offer a closer look at the damage. Unlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, according to Ars Technica . SpaceX said in a post on X that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. “The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday. The booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design in October .) It’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. The company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship. That includes demonstrating the ability to transfer fuel to Starship from a “tanker” version of the rocket while in orbit. SpaceX needs to prove that capability to NASA before it can proceed with crewed missions to the moon, which it is reportedly targeting for 2028.

One Democratic commissioner dissented, saying the decision leaves the United States \"less safe\" at a time when threats are increasing.", "content": "The Federal Communications Commission voted 2-1 along party lines on Thursday to scrap rules that required U.S. phone and internet giants to meet certain minimum cybersecurity requirements. The FCC’s two Trump-appointed commissioners, chairman Brendan Carr and his Republican colleague Olivia Trusty, voted to withdraw the rules that require telecommunications carriers to “secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.” The Biden administration had adopted these rules prior to leaving office earlier this year . The FCC’s sole Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, dissented. In a statement following the vote, Gomez called the now-overturned rules the “only meaningful effort this agency has advanced” since the discovery of a sweeping campaign by a China-backed hacking group called Salt Typhoon that involved hacking into a raft of U.S. phone and internet companies . The hackers broke into more than 200 telcos, including AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen, during the years-long campaign to conduct broad-scale surveillance of American officials. In some cases, the hackers targeted wiretap systems that the U.S. government previously required telcos to install for law enforcement access. The FCC’s move to change the rules sparked rebuke from senior lawmakers, including Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI), the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Peters said he was “disturbed” by the FCC’s effort to roll back “basic cybersecurity safeguards” and warned that doing so will “leave the American people exposed.” Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the rule change “leaves us without a credible plan” to address the basic security gaps exploited by Salt Typhoon and others. For its part, the NCTA, which represents the telecommunications industry, praised the scrapping of the rules, calling them “prescriptive and counterproductive regulations.” But Gomez warned that while collaboration w", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/despite-chinese-hacks-trumps-fcc-votes-to-scrap-cybersecurity-rules-for-phone-and-internet-companies/", "timestamp": 1763766982.532184}

Pinterest, however, was excluded, in line with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) rules. Twitch will no longer allow Australians under 16 to create accounts starting December 10, a Twitch spokesperson told TechCrunch. Existing accounts for users under 16 will be deactivated on January 9. Globally, Twitch is open to users 13 and older, and anyone under the legal age of adulthood in their region must have a parent or guardian involved, the spokesperson said. Pinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Australia’s eSafety stated that Twitch is categorized as an “age-restricted social media platform” because the service is built around online social interaction and engagement features like livestreaming. Pinterest, on the other hand, is mainly used for collecting images and ideas, so it isn’t included in the age-restricted rules. Australia has said its underage social media ban, which will go into effect on December 10, will apply to Meta ‘s Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, YouTube (except YouTube Kids and Google Classroom ), Reddit, and the local streaming service, Kick. These platforms will be required to block account access for users under 16, according to a statement by the internet regulator. About a year ago, Australia passed a law banning social media use for children under 16. At the time, major tech companies like Google and Meta called on the government to delay enforcement until the country finished its age-verification trial. The regulator provides a self-assessment tool to help platforms determine if they must follow the SMMA rules.

Helsinki’s annual Slush conference this year showed a venture market that feels like it is on the brink of transformation, one that’s ready for its first trillion-dollar startup. Founders, venture investors and government officials alike acknowledged the hurdles that have traditionally held Europe back from reaching its true scale and potential. For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash. Firms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since shuttered those shops . OMERs, for example, let much of its European team go . Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco . Largely, people think the kinks have been worked out: Multiple venture investors told TechCrunch at Slush that the notion of the market being undercapitalized, or that deeper U.S. pockets aren’t interested, is overblown. One investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London. (Andreessen later closed its office , too, alas.) Though the lure to head to the U.S. remains strong, European companies are also starting to find success in resisting pressure from U.S. investors to move to the Valley to build their companies.

Digital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly $789 million) in losses in the first five months of 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Many incidents likely go unreported, either because victims are unsure how to file a complaint or wish to avoid additional scrutiny. On Thursday, Google announced the expansion of its real-time scam-detection feature, which uses Gemini Nano to analyze calls on-device and flag potential fraud without recording audio or sending data to Google’s servers. The feature is off by default and applies only to calls from unknown numbers, and it plays a beep during the conversation to notify participants. It debuted in the U.S. in March as a beta for English-speaking Pixel 9 users. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that its on-device scam detection will initially work only on Pixel 9 and later models in India and will be limited to English-speaking users, with its warning also English only. That restricts its reach in a market where Android accounts for nearly 96% of smartphones , per Statcounter, but Pixel devices held less than 1% share in 2024.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer. In the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. Joby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole. “This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.” Archer was quick to strike back. “Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Joby’s case is entirely without merit. The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation,” said Lentell. “As Joby knows, Archer has implemented rigorous employee onboarding procedures to prevent against the very thing it is accused of.

The company suggests users could also post something that could serve as a conversation starter, or they could use the space to share why they might not be available to talk at present. While the addition may be new to many, the company points out in a blog post that this “About” feature, as it’s called, was actually WhatsApp’s first feature.

In a notice published late Wednesday , Salesforce said the hacks involve “Gainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce, which are installed and managed directly by customers.” Salesforce said that there is “no indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,” and that the activity appears related to Gainsight’s “external connection to Salesforce.” When reached for comment, Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda referred TechCrunch to the company’s page dedicated to the incident.

As of this writing, Gainsight said in a status page that it is investigating a “Salesforce connection issue,” without making any reference to a potential breach. “Our internal investigation is ongoing,” Gainsight wrote. A spokesperson for Gainsight did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. On its website, Gainsight touts several corporate customers, including Airtable, Notion, GitLab, and others. When reached by email, GitLab spokesperson Emily James told TechCrunch that GitLab’s “security team is investigating and we’ll get back to you when we have more to share.” The prolific hacking group ShinyHunters told cybersecurity news website DataBreaches.net that it was behind the breach, adding that if Salesforce doesn’t negotiate with them, they will create a new website to advertise the stolen data — a common extortion tactic by financially-motivated cybercriminals. “The", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/salesforce-says-some-of-its-customers-data-was-accessed-after-gainsight-breach/", "timestamp": 1763766983.6951852}

The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions. The company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options. Up to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. To start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo. It’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged. OpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos. The move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience. “Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. Thursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1 , which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model.

This season is highlighting lessons learned from the world of go-to-market strategies. Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen sat down with Luna co-founder Jas Schembri-Stothart and Untapped Solutions founder Andre Peart for their unique perspectives on reaching niche customer segments following their own candidacy during the 2024 Startup Battlefield competition . If our first episode, with Deon Nicholas, co-founder of Forethought AI, we explored what it takes to create a company with a customer-first approach . And in our second episode, we’re diving into guerrilla tactics and experiments that worked in reaching two very different target audiences: teenage girls and formerly incarcerated workers. For Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse. Untapped Solutions had a different challenge. As the “LinkedIn for the formerly incarcerated,” Peart had to find a way to make sure that the platform could actually be deployed into the many places where currently or formerly incarcerated individuals could access it in order to help them attain employment. And to do that, in a space largely untouched by tech solutions, they hit the speaking circuit hard, and even began their own National Reentry Coalition and their own event, which kicked off this Apri", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/why-these-founders-ditched-social-ads-for-taylor-swift-concerts-and-prison-tablets/", "timestamp": 1763766983.9758532}

His character doesn’t get far before an SUV swings onto the sidewalk in front of him; masked ICE agents spill out of the vehicle. “Stop right there,” one of the uniformed players says. It isn’t long before SteveTheGamer55 is surrounded by agents. He hands over his ID while bystander players yell at the agents and demand his release. “Why are you harassing people?” one says, before the worker is finally let go.

After 11 days, the company began contacting those who made purchases, calling it a “clear mistake.”", "content": "On November 8, an offer for loyalty card holders appeared on the website of MediaWorld, a European electronics retailer. The deal: an iPad Air for 15 euros (about $17) instead of the usual €879 (about $1,012). No catch, no strings attached. The proximity to Black Friday only made the offer more plausible. And so several consumers immediately purchased the product by choosing the “payment and pickup in store” opetion, on paper the safest to avoid unexpected problems. The process was seamless, even for those ordering online. According to the accounts of some users on Reddit, their order was accepted, and after about 40 minutes they received an email confirming the availability of the product. In the store, the €15 payment went through successfully and MediaWorld delivered the iPads as expected. The terms and conditions attached to the order make no mention of any clause regarding pricing errors or the possibility for the company to request subsequent additions. Eleven days later, however, MediaWorld sent a simple email—not a formal communication via certified mail—stating that the published price was “clearly incorrect.” The company then asked affected customers to choose between two solutions: Keep the iPad and pay the difference to match the price, but with a €150 discount, or return it and receive a refund of the €15 and a €20 discount voucher for their inconvenience. Following the incident, WIRED contacted MediaWorld for comment. “We confirm that, in a very short period of time, due to a clearly recognizable technical error caused by an extraordinary and unexpected glitch on our ecommerce platform, some products were mistakenly displayed at prices that, due to their clear and objective disconnect from the true market value and the correct promotional price, should never have been displayed.

They included thousands of emails sent between Epstein and high-profile people like Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, political strategist Steve Bannon , journalist Michael Wolff, and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers , as well as revealing text messages . Many of them allude or directly refer to president Donald Trump. Now, you can browse all those emails just like you would on your own Gmail account. Jmail is a website that looks very much like Gmail, except that there is a little hat hanging on the logo and that the profile picture in the top right corner is a grinning Epstein. (Click on it and it says “Hi Jeffrey!”) The inbox lets you click through thousands of emails, formatted to look exactly like a regular message would in your inbox. In the sidebar, you can sort by Inbox, Starred, and Sent. In Gmail, a lower sidebar section reads Labels and separates emails by category. In Jmail, it is a list of people who corresponded with Epstein. The site was created by serial prankster Riley Walz and Luke Igel, cofounder of an AI video editing tool called Kino AI . Igel tells WIRED that he brought the idea to Walz—something Walz confirms—and then the two of them put the website together with Cursor in a single night. Walz revealed Jmail in an X post , writing, “We cloned Gmail, except you're logged in as Epstein and can see his emails.” Jmail is a much more readable way to peruse the huge cache of emails released from the Epstein estate than parsing through tens of thousands of PDFs on a Google Drive. Among its useful features is that it rejiggers Gmail’s starring feature, letting users flag emails they view as important and then ranking them based on how many people do so.

Both platforms get access to one-touch pairing and the helpful Beats app, while iPhone owners also get the benefits of Hey Siri and Find My Device. The other features are a bit of a mixed bag, with a decent battery life of up to 24 hours with ANC on, or 40 with ANC off, but no auto pause when you take them off, or multi-point pairing beyond Google's Chromebook and Android option. Like most headphones from Beats, the sound profile is decidedly bass-forward, but Apple's ownership has tempered that tendency over the last few years. As a result, this generation is more balanced than previous eras, with our reviewer Ryan Waniata complimenting the expansive sound stage and sharp details. Unfortunately, most Beats headsets don't have any equalizer, and the Studio Pro are no different. For better or worse, you're stuck with how they sound coming out of the box. These at least support high-resolution audio, up to 24-bit/48-kHz, but only in the wired USB-C mode. For the Beats enthusiast looking for an upgrade or a second headset for the gym, these are a solid option at a deeply discounted price. They lack some of the richer and more advanced features found on more expensive headsets, but that may be the right compromise for some folks who just want something simple that works every time.

In China, parents are buying them for children as young as five. Adults want to be able to call their kids and track their location down to a specific building floor. But that’s not why children are clamoring for the devices, specifically ones made by a company called Xiaotiancai, which translates to Little Genius in English. The watches, which launched in 2015 and cost up to $330, are a portal into an elaborate world that blends social engagement with relentless competition. Kids can use the watches to buy snacks at local shops, chat and share videos with friends, play games, and, sure, stay in touch with their families. But the main activity is accumulating as many “likes” as possible on their watch’s profile page. On the extreme end, Chinese media outlets have reported on kids who buy bots to juice their numbers, hack the watches to dox their enemies, and sometimes even find romantic partners. According to tech research firm Counterpoint Research, Little Genius accounts for nearly half of global market share for kids’ smartwatches. Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle. She racked up more than one million likes and became a mini-celebrity on the platform. She said she met all three of her boyfriends through the watch, two of whom she broke up with because they asked her to send erotic photos. High like counts have become a sort of status symbol.

The internal components of the LiPlay+ are largely unchanged, with the same small sensor for recording images, a rear LCD screen so you can see what you shot before you print, and the ability to also use the camera as a printer, printing any image from your phone. Externally, the new Mini LiPlay+ is not massively different than the Mini LiPlay . The body is slightly more squared off, and the selfie mirror is gone. There's now a rear-facing camera to take self-portraits, and you can compose in the LCD screen, but more on this in a minute. The shutter button is a bit smaller, but in the same place, and the audio record button is gone from the front. Fujifilm Instax Mini LiPlay+ Hybrid Instant Camera Rating: 8/10 The back is quite different and nicely improved. Instead of a row of buttons, they've been moved off to the side to make room for a slightly larger rear LCD. The screen is bright enough when reviewing images indoors, but it's difficult to use in bright sunlight. I also found it annoying that the only film count indicator is on the screen. I much prefer the row of 10 lights found on other Instax printers, where each light turns off to show remaining prints. There's still the four-way click wheel in the center, which handles selecting all the various options and makes scrolling through menus pretty simple. There are now four smaller buttons: a dedicated back button, as well as buttons for printing, reviewing photos, and recording audio. One thing that's completely unchanged from the LiPlay is the lens and sensor.

Updated November 2025: We’ve added the CMF Watch 3 Pro and our thoughts on the Withings ScanWatch 2 running the latest update. Fitness Trackers vs. Smartwatches vs. Smart Rings Smartwatches typically replicate many of the functions found in your smartphone via apps—you can control smart home functions, start conversations via WhatsApp, respond to Slack messages, and call up smart assistants like Siri or Gemini to ask almost anything. This is in conjunction with the standard health and fitness tracking features, plus a more familiar touchscreen interface. However, the downside is the battery life typically lasts a day or two, if not a little more. Fitness trackers , on the other hand, aren't as feature-rich. You typically won't be able to access many other apps. There's the basic ability to read emails and texts, control music playback, or even access tap-to-pay features, but you're generally more restricted. They deliver the same if not better health- and fitness-tracking capabilities (depending on the model) than smartwatches.

This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it. They come with lots of storage. The company stuffs 256 GB as standard into most of its smartphones, even some of the cheap models. Most Android flagship devices still come with just 128 GB. Motorola is also one of the only phone brands to still include a microSD card slot to expand storage on many of its devices, and the Moto G phones retain the headphone jack. There’s broad carrier support. While some Android phone brands have inconsistent carrier support in the US, like Nothing , Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company lists carrier support details in the Specs section of all its phones).

But can you trust a viral TikTok product rave? Or will it turn out to be one of those shoddy products from as-seen-on-TV ads? Don't worry, the WIRED Gear team has you covered.

Loop Amazon Loop Loop earplugs go viral on a regular basis, and the Experience 2 have stayed in my concert go-bag ever since I first tried them. They're comfortable to wear, and they dampen sound without muffling it. I can always hear the bass or my friends that are talking to me, but I don't wake up with ringing ears the next day. My favorite part, though, is that they're very visible. People can tell when you have them in at-a-glance, which isn't the case with traditional pairs that rest flush against your ear canal.

I've already made four rounds of mashed potatoes, three of mac and cheese, and three turkeys (with more still waiting in my fridge) as part of testing smart probes to help smoke turkeys outside and preparing seven-course holiday meal kits for friends and family. I was eager to finally outsource some of the cooking by testing two very different robo-chef devices, the Thermomix TM7 and the Posha kitchen robot . Both promise to plan my meals and also do most of the cooking, which sounds pretty good to me. The Thermomix descends from a German device launched in 1968—a time when the best-known robot chef was cartoon Rosie on The Jetsons —that was essentially a blender with a heater. It's since caught on big in countries from Italy to Portugal to Australia, and over the years it's added multi-tier steaming, baking, proofing, a touchscreen, an encyclopedic recipe app, and a whole lot of smart features. WIRED reviewer Joe Ray called 2020's last-generation Thermomix TM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) the “smartest of the smart kitchen.\" The newest version, the seventh-generation TM7, was released in August and looks like a giant trophy with a computer screen. It retails for $1,699 and its goal is to replace almost every appliance in your kitchen. It'll even happily order groceries for you on InstaCart. The newest robo-chef entrant is Posha, a Silicon Valley-via-Bangalore startup device that aims at truly autonomous one-pot cooking, once you've chopped up the proper ingredients into little bins. The Posha kitchen robot was released in January at a price of $1,750 and promptly sold out, as has each successive batch. The device comes complete with a robot stirring arm, and a camera to monitor moisture and browning. Press a button, and Posha will add ingredients at the appropriate moment, spice and stir your food, add water and oil, and cook it down, all without your participation.

Yes, you can get excellent wireless earbuds nowadays, but maybe you prefer plugging in or don't want to charge your headphones. The joy of the 3.5-mm headphone connector is that it’s universal. You can use any pair of corded headphones —no need to worry whether the connectivity will blip in and out, no batteries to charge, no dongles to attach, and no earbuds to lose (or earbud cases to run through the washing machine). There are times when Bluetooth is preferable , but having the option is nice. Unfortunately, every year, another major manufacturer decides to cut the headphone jack from its list of features. In 2025, that's Samsung, which no longer offers the venerable port on its Galaxy A-series phones . But don't lose hope!

It all began when Apple removed the port on the iPhone 7 in 2016—yes, technically Oppo did it first, but it was Apple's decision that sparked an industry trend. Apple famously cited space-saving reasons to make the phone slimmer and fit a bigger battery, but it was also to nudge along the burgeoning wireless headphone market (guess who sits at the top right now ?). Since then, other companies followed swiftly, until the port was only found on budget and midrange phones. Now, cheap phones are beginning to lose the port, likely because you can buy decent wireless earbuds for as little as $30 these days .

Updated November 2025: We've added headphones from iClever, and an honorable mention for Heyday headphones. Why Kid-Specific Headphones? Some of the criteria we use for evaluating adult headphones simply don't apply for small children (although it's still worth taking a look ). Sound quality matters a little less. We look for ease of use, different colors (Adrienne's daughter won't use anything that's not pink), comfort, and durability. Most headphones that are explicitly for children have a volume-limiting feature called output limitation, which automatically reduces the volume to about 85 decibels. That is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's limit for workplace exposure and about what you'd hear in heavy traffic. However, that's still really high! Even if your child's headphones have volume output limitation, it's a good idea to check on them every so often. To test whether the volume is too high I note whether my kid can hear me when I sit next to them and say, “Time to give your brother a turn.” If she can't hear me, the volume needs to go down.

We've tested some of the best nut and plant milk makers on the market today. These nifty high-tech machines sit on your counter and do all the work for you, giving you supremely fresh, additive-free plant milk. I've tested these nut milk makers with oat, almond, and coconut, and most often use in cereal and coffee.

His proposal: use :-) and :-( as markers to distinguish jokes from serious comments. While Fahlman describes himself as “the inventor … or at least one of the inventors” of what would later be called the smiley face emoticon , the full story reveals something more interesting than a lone genius moment. The whole episode started three days earlier when computer scientist Neil Swartz posed a physics problem to colleagues on Carnegie Mellon’s “bboard,” which was an early online message board. The discussion thread had been exploring what happens to objects in a free-falling elevator, and Swartz presented a specific scenario involving a lit candle and a drop of mercury. That evening, computer scientist Howard Gayle responded with a facetious message titled “WARNING!” He claimed that an elevator had been “contaminated with mercury” and suffered “some slight fire damage” due to a physics experiment. Despite clarifying posts noting the warning was a joke, some people took it seriously. The incident sparked immediate discussion about how to prevent such misunderstandings and the “flame wars” (heated arguments) that could result from misread intent. “This problem caused some of us to suggest (only half seriously) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously,” Fahlman later wrote in a retrospective post published on his CMU website. “After all, when using text-based online communication, we lack the body language or tone-of-voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone.” On September 17, 1982, the next day after the misunderstanding on the CMU bboard, Swartz made the first concrete proposal: “Maybe we should adopt a convention of putting a star (*) in the subject f", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/a-computer-scientist-invented-the-emoticon-after-his-colleagues-misunderstood-sarcasm/", "timestamp": 1763766991.981123}

Originally launched as a barebones password manager for the company to bundle alongside NordVPN , there was never much reason to use it.

It’s still missing some features like Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) storage that help options like 1Password and Proton Pass shoot ahead of the pack, and it could stand to offer more organization. But the core service of storing and autofilling your passwords is excellent, bolstered by additional features like email masking. NordPass has a free plan, which is great to see in a post-LastPass world . I prefer Proton Pass for free password managers, mainly due to the fact that it supports cross-device sync.

The RAISE Act passed through New York’s legislature in June, and is due to be signed or vetoed by governor Kathy Hochul before the end of the year. It’s one of a handful of state AI safety bills across the country that attempt to regulate AI developers—even as the Trump administration readies an executive order aimed at thwarting state-level AI laws.

Researchers are skeptical, and critics see it as a way for China’s bosses to keep workers productive.", "content": "Forget coffee, you can now stay alert by strapping on a wristband that lightly zaps you awake. That’s what eCoffee Energyband, a Chinese gadget that sells for just over $100, is claiming to do. First released in late 2023, the product is a lightweight wearable with two electrode pads that sit against the inner wrist. WAT Medical , a Canadian company with a Chinese subsidiary making and marketing the device, claims the mild electrical signals sent by the wristband can keep wearers alert by stimulating nerves in the brain. The effect is supposedly about the same as a cup of coffee, minus the risk of caffeine addiction. The only side effect is that your hand could feel numb from the tip of the finger to the inner wrist, the company says, so the makers suggest that it only be worn for three hours a day, and users can switch which wrists they put it on. The gadget would likely have stayed in relative obscurity if the company that makes it had not attended a recent Chinese trade show, whereafter it suddenly went viral. “The purpose of inventing this eCoffee Energyband is not to replace coffee. Coffee is great, but it’s not always suitable for the afternoon or evening. But we still have the need to feel refreshed during those times,” Xu Haojie, the company’s director of operations, told Chinese state media Xinhua at the trade show. After wearing it, the Xinhua reporter said, “It feels like I’m being gently tapped. I can feel the electric pulse.” It immediately became a sensation online. On Chinese ecommerce websites, including JD and Taobao, the device appears to be sold out as of now, with hundreds of mixed reviews from buyers. The device is also sold and shipped to markets around the world. The website lists its normal price at $130, with a holiday promotion going on right now that knocks 30 percent off the price. But on Chinese social media, the wristband has been met with overwhelming sarcasm and skepticism.

Many of the updates in this release are targeted at corporate adoption, from putting Nano Banana Pro in Google Slides for business presentations to integrating the new model with Google Ads for advertisers globally. This “Pro” release is an iteration on its Nano Banana model that dropped earlier this year. Nano Banana became a viral sensation after users started posting personalized action figures and other meme-able creations on social media. Nano Banana Pro builds out the AI tool with a bevy of new abilities, like generating images in 4K resolution. It’s free to try out inside Google’s Gemini app, with paid Google One subscribers getting access to additional generations. One specific improvement is going to be catnip for corporations in this release: text rendering. From my initial tests generating outputs with text, Nano Banana Pro improves on the wonky lettering and strange misspellings common in many image models, including Google’s past releases. Google wants the images generated by this new model—text and all—to be more polished and production-ready for business use cases. “Even if you have one letter off it's very obvious,” says Nicole Brichtova, a product lead for image and video at Google DeepMind . “It's kind of like having hands with six fingers; it's the first thing you see.” She says part of the reason Nano Banana Pro is able to generate text more cleanly is the switch to a more powerful underlying model, Gemini 3 Pro .

The charges, which were unsealed in federal court on Wednesday, are part of a wider government effort to crack down on the smuggling of advanced AI chips to China. Over the past few years, the US has introduced a series of export control rules designed to prevent Chinese organizations from acquiring computer chips that have become popular for developing AI chatbots . The restrictions aim to slow China in what US officials have described as a race to develop powerful AI systems , including surveillance tools and autonomous weapons . Some Chinese companies have been forced to make do with older or less capable chips, but others have allegedly turned to smugglers. The new indictment alleges that Hon Ning Ho, Brian Curtis Raymond, Cham Li, and Jing Chen worked together to buy Nvidia chips through a sham real estate company in Florida and then resold them to Chinese companies. The hardware was allegedly shipped to China using doctored customs paperwork by way of Thailand and Malaysia, two countries that US regulators have identified as hot spots for chip smuggling. Prosecutors allege that the defendants exported about 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs and attempted to smuggle about 50 of Nvidia’s newer chips, known as the H200. The defendants are also accused of trying to export about 10 Hewlett Packard Enterprise supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 chips. Two undisclosed Chinese companies allegedly paid the defendants nearly $3.9 million in total for their efforts, according to the indictment, which was first reported by Court Watch . “This is an extremely serious offense.

Platform incompatibility has fostered real-life social friction, like the “ green bubble shaming ” phenomenon, where iPhone owners exclude Android owners from group chats. But Google has been working to minimize these disruptions. The company launched a crusade to convince Apple to adopt the RCS messaging standard to fix the common messaging hiccups between Android phones and iPhones. Google also worked with Apple to create a specification for unwanted tracking alerts—when your phone identifies an AirTag or another Bluetooth tracker on your person. Today, Google is fixing incompatibility issues with AirDrop. iPhone owners have been able to easily share files, contacts, photos, and anything else through Apple's wireless sharing system, provided both parties have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Android phones have their own sharing protocol called Quick Share , but starting today and beginning with Google's Pixel 10 smartphones , Quick Share can work with AirDrop to send data to iPhones, iPads , and Macs of any variety . The caveat is that the iPhone user will need to switch AirDrop into the “Everyone for 10 Minutes” mode instead of \"Contacts Only\" mode. Google says this isn't some kind of workaround solution. It's a direct, peer-to-peer connection; your data isn't routed through a server, shared content isn't logged, and no extra data is shared. Naturally, iPhone owners will be able to send data back to Pixel 10 phones as well. Google has not worked with Apple on this cross-compatibility, as the company says it \"welcomes the opportunity\" to work with Apple so that this sharing function can work in the Contacts Only mode. “We accomplished this through our own implementation,” a Google spokesperson tells WIRED. “Our goal is to provide an easy and secure file-sharing experience for our users, regardless of who they are communicating with.” In a security blog post , Google says the underlying strategy for what makes this", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pixel-10-can-now-share-files-with-apples-airdrop/", "timestamp": 1763766995.611825}

It was called Swatch x You , and it let you tweak Swatch's standard New Gent 41-mm model by selecting one of the (surprisingly limited) preset designs, which you could then move, zoom, and rotate to fit over the watch and strap. You could also add in a chip for NFC payments, and, as a final flourish, put a very short personal message on the case back (to a maximum of 15 characters). As you can tell, although a fun idea, this offering was never designed to be anything near approaching bespoke. From tomorrow, however, the MoonSwatch maker is taking its Swatch x You model and giving it an artificial intelligence makeover. Dubbed AI‑DADA, Swatch says this AI-powered design tool lets you create entirely unique watches starting from a blank canvas and using only your imagination as a guide to the final outcome. After logging into your Swatch account, you prompt AI‑DADA with your own idea, then, in less than two minutes, a “unique watch design comes to life.” To underline this uniqueness, each AI‑DADA watch carries a “1/1” sign on its case back.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They’ll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says.

But with so many options, fads, and a never-ending list of additives, it’s easy to grab the wrong one. I’ve sifted through the market to find the best of the best protein powder. (As with any dietary supplement, please consult a medical professional or registered dietitian before consuming protein powder.) For more powders, tonics, and elixirs , check out our guides to the Magnesium Supplements , Should I Be Taking Creatine , and Best Mushroom Gummies . Updated November 2025: We've added Puori's PW1 Whey Protein as a new pick, along with protein powders to avoid. Information, prices, and links were also updated. Optimum Nutrition Amazon Optimum Nutrition GNC Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard Whey has been a longtime favorite among gym rats. It’s affordable, widely available, and tastes good. It delivers 24 grams of protein per serving, sourced from a blend of whey isolate, concentrate, and peptides. The vanilla ice cream flavor has been my go-to for three years. I use it in smoothies, but I love it even more for baking—I like to swap a couple of scoops for some", "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-protein-powders/", "timestamp": 1763766999.6508162}

But the trick to getting rid of paper is to not worry about being perfect.", "content": "Wanting to get rid of paper in your life is easy. Following through with that promise to yourself is hard. I've been mostly paperless for close to 15 years, and the trick to it for me was to think about it the same way I think about taking care of my teeth. Staying organized is a kind of hygiene. It's almost never a one-and-done cleanup job. So think about dental hygiene . We learn to brush our teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and see a dentist every six months to catch problems before they get worse. However, if you don't follow that schedule precisely, you can still have good dental hygiene. You just have to do enough . If you do almost everything you're supposed to, but you miss two days of flossing or are a few months late scheduling your next cleaning, your teeth won't suddenly fall out. With hygiene (or any kind of maintenance), you don't have to be perfect; you just have to be good enough. Going paperless is very much like that. Here, I want to share with you the plan I used to remove most paper from my life. It should help you get started, but know in advance that you don't have to stick to it exactly every moment of every day. You can mess up. You can forget. So long as you get into the habit most of the time, you'll find yourself mostly paperless in a couple of months. Decide where to keep digitized papers. A natural choice is to save them in a cloud storage service , such as Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. By saving them in the cloud, you always have a backup. If you save files locally to your device, you could lose them all if your device is destroyed, lost, or stolen. Create an inbox. An inbox is nothing more than a folder where you will save newly scanned papers by default. If you are highly organized, you might have specific folders where you want to sort each paper you scan. That's great. But where will the files go when you're feeling lazy or strapped for time? By creating an inbox, you have a catch-all place where scanne", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-go-paperless-in-9-steps/", "timestamp": 1763766999.9656918}

Could this deeply misunderstood body part really be the seat of so much modern dysfunction?", "content": "I was settling into one of those airport activity tables with high stools and electric outlets at my flight’s gate, waiting for the agent to announce boarding, when I felt a gathering storm at the apex of my butt cheeks. This was my last flight after being away from home on a book tour in May. For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves. But I’d moved just fine from plane to hotel to bookstore. I’d even made a point of walking to the bookstores from hotels and back, to indulge some kind of Walt Whitman–esque fantasy. But now, at the last moment, alarm bells were going off. The pain felt as if I’d taken a hard hit to my tailbone, as I’d once done after going off a jump in an inner tube and landing ass-first on hard-packed snow. But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute. I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination. By the time I had to stand up, it was all I could do to not cry out—as bad as the pain was sitting down, standing up sent a radical guitar solo through my coccyx. At that time, I was about four months postpartum from delivering my first baby, and had had a blissful recovery, all things considered. I had pelvic muscles of steel, thanks to over a decade of lifting heavy weights, a practice I continued until two weeks before giving birth. I had only been back to lifting for a couple of months—deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead press, here and there some rows or lat pull-downs—but everything had been going well. At first I thought maybe the pain would disappear as quickly and mysteriously as it came.

Our favorite machines here can turn your barista into a stranger.", "content": "Amazon Ratio Amazon Amazon Drip coffee has undergone a quiet revolution. The best coffee makers of today are nothing like the stained break-room Mr. Coffee you might remember from your first office job. Drip is now, uh, drip . The new generation of drip coffee machines is not just technologically sophisticated but kinda culturally sophisticated—exercising tight control of time and temperature and even borrowing some barista techniques from third-wave café pour-over to get beautiful, gentle, aromatic extraction without the burn or bitterness. As a longtime booster for drip coffee, I'm loving this moment. Besides, filtered coffee is good for you. What's better, most of the best drip coffee machines on this list have a lower difficulty rating than your toaster oven . My top pick, the Fellow Aiden ($400) , is a powerful machine that can account for your local elevation and has special recipes for individual coffee beans—and yet WIRED reviewer Pete Cottell managed a great mug within eight minutes of unpacking the box. My favorite full-flavored single-mug device, the Ratio Four ($259) , has only a single button. So without even trying, you can sip your drip coffee at home and say, “Man, I really taste the lychee notes in this natural-process gesha.” Or just enjoy the delicious, delicious joe. After jittering myself up testing 20 drip coffee makers this year, these are my favorite fully automated immersion-brew coffee makers that make flavorful drip, pour-over coffee, or something splendidly in between.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent. Similarly, since implementation of the Online Safety Act , Pornhub has lost nearly 80 percent of its UK viewership. The company argues that it’s a privacy risk to leave age verification up to third-party sites and that people will simply seek adult content on platforms that don’t comply with the laws. “We have seen an exponential surge in sea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pornhub-is-urging-tech-giants-to-enact-device-based-age-verification/", "timestamp": 1763767001.1925046}

Replacing it takes investment, but Cisco is making the case that it’s worth it.", "content": "Aging digital infrastructure equipment like routers , network switches , and network-attached storage—has long posed a silent risk to organizations. In the short term, it's cheaper and easier to just leave those boxes running in a forgotten closet. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.” Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier). We revise the rating to REDUCE (from SELL earlier) as the stock has reduced >7% over last month and we see limited downside from hereon.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

Kennedy Jr. on Friday said that he ordered the change on US health agency CDC's website to suggest vaccines may cause autism, citing insufficient studies on vaccine safety.", "content": "After the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that claims about vaccines not causing autism are not ‘evidence-based’, the US Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr on Friday asserted that he personally ordered the agency to abandon its longstanding position that vaccines do not cause autism. In an interview to New York Times, Kennedy said he ordered the CDC to change its guidance in part because high-quality large studies had not been conducted to examine a potential link between autism and other shots given in the first year of life. Earlier, the CDC's website stated that studies have shown there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder. However, on Thursday, updating the webpage, CDC said, “The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism.” Kennedy cited gaps in vaccine safety science to explain why the CDC website made a significant shift in its stance to say past claims that vaccines don’t cause autism lacked evidence. “The whole thing about ‘vaccines have been tested and there’s been this determination made,’ is just a lie,” Kennedy Jr added. “The phrase ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not supported by science.” He, however, acknowledged that large-scale epidemiological studies of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had found no link to autism, and that studies of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal had also shown no link.

The 25-year-old celebrated her win on stage as the audience watched the end of what has been one of the most turbulent Miss Universe seasons in recent memory. Mexico’s Fátima Bosch has been crowned Miss Universe, with Miss Thailand securing the runner-up title. This year’s Miss Universe ceremony took place in Thailand, with Puerto Rico revealed as the host for next year’s edition. The event ran into several major problems from the start. First, there were claims that one contestant was not treated fairly and her intelligence was questioned. This upset many participants and led to some of them walking out in protest. The tension continued to build until the end, when the host became emotional and broke down in tears, bringing the difficult and dramatic situation into full view. Bosch’s victorious night came after weeks of headline-making controversy. Earlier in November, she walked out of an official pageant event after a Thai official publicly scolded her in front of dozens of fellow contestants. The official also reportedly warned that contestants who supported Bosch could face disqualification, a moment that quickly spread across the internet and divided pageant fans. This year’s finalists included contestants from Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Guadeloupe, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, China, the Philippines, Thailand, Malta, and Côte d’Ivoire. Notably, Indian badminton icon Saina Nehwal served on the judging panel for the 2025 pageant.  Shortly after being crowned Miss Universe 2025, Fátima Bosch was visibly emotional as the moment sank in. Surrounded by fellow contestants, she received warm hugs, cheers and applause from those who had supported her throughout the competition.

After that, he said, the PTI never contacted him again. Kiriakou had shared his analysis of the India-Pakistan conflict during an interview with ANI in October.

NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL) is the international subsidiary of National Payments Corporation of India.

The UPI–TIPS link, once operational, is expected sharply reduce transfer costs and settlement friction for millions of users who send or receive money between India and the eurozone. The integration is also expected to boost merchant acceptance for Indian travellers in Europe, similar to the QR-based roll-outs already underway in markets such as Singapore.

UPI, or unified payments interface, is India’s digital payment system that allows instant, 24×7 money transfers between bank accounts through a mobile app. These initiatives are aligned with the G20 Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments, with a focus on cheaper, efficient, more transparent and more accessible remittances, the RBI's statement said.

The government has said the move aims to simplify rules and improve worker protection. A key change under the new codes is the definition of ‘wages’, which now includes basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance, with at least 50% of total remuneration counted as wages. Previously, employers often structured salary packages so that basic pay plus DA formed a small portion of total compensation, with large parts allocated to allowances that did not count towards benefits such as gratuity or provident fund. Under the new labour codes , every component of the cost-to-company (CTC) will now be treated as remuneration unless specifically exempted, with the maximum exemption capped at 50% of total compensation. “‘Wages’ now include basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension, and social security benefits,” an official statement said. The change is expected to impact the calculation of various social security contributions, including Provident Fund (PF), Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), Workmen’s Compensation, and maternity benefits. “The definition of ‘wage’ under the labour codes is likely to impact the base for calculation of various other social security contributions like Provident Fund, ESIC, Workmen's Compensation, Maternity Benefit etc. It will depend upon how individual employers have structured their salaries into different components,” said Madhu Damodaran, regional managing partner, AM Legals, a law firm. The impact on gratuity will be significant. Since gratuity is calculated based on the last drawn wages and years of service, a higher proportion of basic pay and DA in the wage base will result in a larger lump-sum payout at exit. “With this", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-labour-codes-wage-definition-gratuity-pf-benefits-11763730543183.html", "timestamp": 1763767074.000867}

In March 2024, a Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA) of the IAF had crashed near a residential colony in Jaisalmer while returning from the tri-services military exercise 'Bharat Shakti' in Pokhran desert in what was the first accident involving the indigenously-built single-engine jet since it began flying in 2001. The pilot had ejected safely. Tejas is a 4.5-generation fighter aircraft developed to carry out offensive air support, close-range combat and ground-attack missions, according to HAL’s description. Designed for multi-role performance, it is capable of operating in both land and maritime environments, making it one of India’s most flexible home-grown aircraft. The Tejas lineup includes single-seat fighters for the Air Force and Navy, as well as twin-seat trainer variants for both services. The latest and most advanced version, the LCA Mk1A, features major enhancements for better combat effectiveness and survivability.

Judgment reserved,” a division bench comprising Justice Anil Kshetarpal and Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar said during the hearing, reported Live Law. Moitra had asked the Delhi HC to strike down the Lokpal’s 12 November order – claiming it ignored her submissions and violated basic principles of natural justice. No interim order, however, has been passed on Moitra's application for stay on the sanction order. The cash-for-query case centers on the allegation that Moitra had asked questions in the House in exchange for cash and gifts from businessman, Darshan Hiranandani. In her plea, Moitra sought to overturn the Lokpal November 12 order granting sanction to the CBI – arguing that the decision is flawed, violates the provisions of the Lokpal Act – and is a violation of principles of natural justice. Appearing for Moitra, Senior Advocate Nidhesh Gupta submitted that there was clear infirmity in the procedure adopted by the Lokpal as enumerated under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013. Citing Section 20(7), which requires the Lokpal to seek the public servant’s comments before granting sanction, Gupta said the Lokpal said that “I won't see any material at all” and granted sanction, mentioned a report by Live Law. The CBI – in July – had submitted its report to the Lokpal – months after registering an FIR on March 21, 2024, against Moitra and Hiranandani under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The report alleged she took bribes and other benefits in exchange for parliamentary questions and compromised national security by sharing her Lok Sabha login credentials, as per multiple reports.

India’s five-year submissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are meant to set more ambitious emission-cut targets. So far, as many as 120 of the 196 member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)have submitted their updated climate plans. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming well below 2°C and ideally to 1.5°C. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), meeting those goals will require cutting annual emissions by 35% to 55% by 2035 compared with 2019 levels. India is commonly counted as the third-largest emitter of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), after China and the United States. Some Indian officials, however, argue that focusing solely on total emissions overlooks this per capita context. Its per capita emissions are relatively low — around 2 tonnes per person. The formal deadline for submitting the updated NDCs for the 2035 cycle was 10 February 2025. However, the UNFCCC allowed an extended cut-off until September 2025. Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav , who led the Indian delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by December. India and Saudi Arabia are the only two G20 nations yet to release their updated NDCs for the COP30 summit. The NDC document lists each country’s climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement and is released every five years. “We will declare our revised NDCs till 2035 and also the first Biennial Transparency Report,” Yadav said. Asked why India hadn’t submitted its updated NDC document, Yadav said it wasn’t because of missing any deadline. “There are several steps, including cabinet approval, before the document is released,” he", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/at-cop30-india-s-delayed-climate-agenda-draws-global-attention-when-will-new-delhi-submit-it-and-what-do-we-know-11763725527361.html", "timestamp": 1763767075.3933666}

It has been jointly developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) for the IAF. The IAF Tejas is equipped with a tailless, compound delta wing design with “relaxed static stability”, which enhances its manoeuvrability and agility. Tejas is India's first homegrown fighter aircraft, even though it has a foreign engine. The first test flight of the Technology Demonstrator-1 (TD-1) was conducted in 2001. Years later in 2016, the maiden flight of the Second Series Production (SP2) Tejas aircraft of Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) configuration was conducted. The HAL Tejas is capable of carrying out multiple functions, including aerial interception of enemy aircraft, air-to-surface strikes, and anti-shipping operations — making it perfect for a fighter jet. The IAF Tejas is built from a mix of aluminium-lithium alloys, titanium alloys, and advanced carbon-fibre composite materials, making it a light aircraft and therefore easy to manoeuver during tricky situations. These composite materials constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, making it one of the lightest among contemporary aircraft.

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture.

This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality.
