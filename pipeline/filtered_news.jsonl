The committee’s report was on the ‘Review of Autonomous Bodies and Institutions – NTA, NAAC , Draft UGC Regulations, ICHR, ICPR, ICSSR, IIAS ( Shimla ) and Auroville Foundation under the Department of Higher Education’ The committee, headed by Rajya Sabha MP and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, noted that NTA did not declare the results of the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) in time in the last few years. “Such a delay is a cause of major concern as it not only delays the admission process but also delays the start of the academic session by the on-boarded universities, which ultimately puts unnecessary pressure on the students. The Committee emphasises that NTA should not only conduct the examinations within time but also declare the results in a time-bound manner,” it stated in its report. Referring to 14 competitive examinations conducted by NTA in 2024, the committee observed that at least five faced major issues – UGC-NET , CSIR-NET , and NEET-PG were postponed, NEET-UG saw paper leaks, and CUET results were postponed.

From the sanctioned posts of 56,520, KVs were able to fill 46,347 posts, which include both teaching and non-teaching staff.

Due to this, filling up of vacancies is a continuous process, and efforts are made to fill up the vacancies as per the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules.

Around 32,000 students were enrolled in these courses across the state when the Supreme Court, on November 5 last year, deemed the Uttar Pradesh madarsa education board’s practice of awarding Kamil (graduate-level) and Fazil (postgraduate-level) degrees “unconstitutional”, ruling that such authority lies only with universities regulated under the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act. For Saqlain Raza, a Fazil first-year student at Madarsa Jamia Farooquia in Varanasi, the ruling has forced a major shift. Raza, who has already cleared his first-year Fazil exam, is now preparing to join Kashi Vidyapeeth for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. “I have to think about my career. Given the situation, I will pursue BA, and later, MA,” he told PTI. He said although his Aalim (higher secondary) qualification makes him eligible for BA admission, the years he spent pursuing Kamil and Fazil would effectively go to waste. Raza is not alone. Many students pursuing higher religious studies in madrassas are uncertain about their academic careers. Ghulam Masih, a Kamil first-year student from Madarsa Darul Uloom Faiz-ur-Rasool in Siddharthnagar, said he too is planning to enrol into BA and MA courses from a university.

The elected government, several political parties, and many aspirants had urged the JKPSC to postpone the exam. “The examination was successfully conducted at 53 centres across Jammu and Kashmir. Of the total 22,573 registered candidates, 13,732 appeared for the tests — a turnout of 60.83 per cent — in two sessions,” JKPSC Additional Secretary and Controller of Examination, Sachin Jamwal, told PTI.

Asked about the reasons for the low turnout, he said such attendance was usual, noting that in previous examinations too, the turnout had consistently remained around 60 to 61 per cent. Referring to the situation as extraordinary, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote to the JKPSC chairman on Saturday, saying the ongoing disruption in flight services has caused widespread chaos, and it has been “further compounded by the prevailing uncertainty” over the Lok Bhavan’s “delay” in approving age relaxation for aspirants. However, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha refuted the claim that the Lok Bhavan had caused a delay. Sinha wrote on social media that he had returned the file the same day, December 2, with a query about the possibility of holding the examination on the scheduled date if the upper age limit was relaxed, but received no follow-up from the government.

The new visas will specifically target industries that depend heavily on seasonal labour, including horticulture, agriculture, tourism, and hospitality. The GWSV and PSV are expected to simplify the hiring process for roles that, while temporary in nature, are vital to New Zealand’s economic cycles. By streamlining recruitment procedures, the government aims to provide employers with quicker access to qualified seasonal workers, thereby supporting industries during peak demand periods. The step is taken to balance New Zealand’s economic needs with regulatory oversight, ensuring that seasonal employment opportunities are filled fairly and transparently. Global Workforce Seasonal Visa (GWSV) The Global Workforce Seasonal Visa (GWSV) has been introduced to support industries that require long-term seasonal labour. It comes with several distinctive features and requirements: — Streamlined hiring process: Employers are not required to advertise locally or conduct a labour market test before hiring under this visa. — Experience criteria : Applicants must demonstrate at least three seasons of relevant work experience within the last six years. — Residency condition : Holders of the visa must spend a minimum of three months outside New Zealand each year. — Validity period : The visa will be issued for three years, offering stability for both employers and workers. — Safeguards : Applicants must meet health and character requirements, ensuring compliance with immigration standa", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/new-zealand-immigration-announces-new-seasonal-visa-categories-under-aewv-framework-10407012/", "timestamp": 1765245872.3819165}

The section on the Ghaznavid invasions is preceded by a box that contains “a word of caution”. The box is similar to the “note on history’s darker periods”, which was published in the class 8 textbook, placed before the chapter on the Delhi Sultanate. The box in the class 7 textbook refers to this note and states that it explains how history has recorded war, conquest and destruction more than peace, good governance or creativity, and how the world over historians have sometimes hesitated to draw attention to such darker periods. “Our approach is that it is better to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. In addition, we should not forget that while past events cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone responsible for them today,” it reads. The new textbook is meant for use in the ongoing academic session. Part 1 of the textbook was released earlier this year. The old NCERT class 7 history textbook had a paragraph on the Mahmud of Ghazni. It pointed out that rulers tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples, and chose to target temples which were sometimes extremely rich when they attacked kingdoms. It referred to the Mahmud of Ghazni as having raided the subcontinent 17 times with a religious motive, targeting wealthy temples and taking away their wealth. ‘The Ghaznavid Invasions’ section has about six pages including boxes and pictures. It details Mahmud’s 17 campaigns in India, his plunder of a temple in Mathura, temples in Kannauj and the destruction of the Somanatha Shiva temple in Somnath, Gujarat.

As per the guidelines, only the top 2,50,000 successful candidates across all categories in the JEE Main 2026 BE/BTech paper will be shortlisted, in accordance with a fixed category-wise distribution. The institute has also reiterated conditions related to age, number of attempts and Class XII qualification. This year, the examination will be held on May 17, Sunday. Under Criterion A1, candidates must be among the top 2,50,000 performers in JEE Main 2026 (BE/BTech paper). The shortlisting for JEE Advanced follows a rigid category-wise percentage: 10% GEN-EWS, 27% OBC-NCL, 15% SC, 7.5% ST and 40.5% OPEN, with 5% horizontal reservation for PwD candidates within each of these categories. IIT Roorkee has clarified that the total may marginally exceed 2.5 lakh if “tied” ranks occur. IIT Roorkee has also noted that OCI/PIO (I) candidates are not eligible for any reserved category benefits, except under OPEN-PwD if applicable. They must qualify strictly in the OPEN lists. To be eligible, candidates must have been born on or after October 1, 2001. A relaxation of five years applies to SC, ST and PwD candidates, meaning they should have been born on or after October 1, 1996. Additionally, a candidate can appear for JEE Advanced only twice in two consecutive years, meaning prior attempts must fall within this two-year window. The exam maintains its long-standing rule of allowing only two attempts in two consecutive years. This means students must plan their Class 12 and JEE Main timelines carefully, as any earlier appearance than 2025 immediately disqualifies them from appearing in 2026.

Instead, the highest-ranked students overwhelmingly prefer central government institutions like PGIMER, other AIIMS-affiliated hospitals, JIPMER, and long-established state-run colleges such as Madras Medical College (MMC), Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC), and KEM Mumbai. Since 2016, the Centre has been releasing a list of top colleges under various categories, including medical. In these nine years, AIIMS Delhi has been the undisputed number 1 . The trend, visible year after year, raises an important question: if NIRF rankings claim to evaluate the “best” institutions, then why are students opting otherwise? And what does this reveal about the effectiveness and limitations of India’s most publicised ranking mechanism for higher education? The NEET-PG 2025 round 1 allotment list reinforces the same trend seen every year: top-ranked candidates choose Central and state government medical colleges, not the private institutions ranked higher on the NIRF list. According to the allotment document, All India Rank (AIR) 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 – all opted for PGIMER at Dr RML Hospital, New Delhi , one of the most sought-after central institutions for MD (General Medicine). Rank 2 chose Government Medical College, Kozhikode – a state-run institution with strong clinical exposure.

The teacher draws a free-body diagram. One student nods confidently, another is still hunting for a missing vector, and someone at the back is hoping calculus doesn’t enter the room. And that is the real point — no matter which one of these three you were, this same school physics is the foundation for both Electrical Engineering (EE) and Engineering Physics (EP). Mechanics, waves, optics, electromagnetism — all of it returns, only deeper. The first year of both degrees is almost identical. If school physics made sense, you’ll be fine. If it didn’t… at least now you know early. The split starts in second year. EE is for students who like opening gadgets just to see what lives inside. It moves straight into circuits, electronics, motors, power systems, communication engineering, sensors, and robotics. Those neat textbook diagrams finally become real lab devices — the kind the instructor warns you not to drop because “this one is expensive.” In EE, you finally understand: – Why radio stations sit 0.2 MHz apart – Why ABS reacts before you even realise the tyre slipped- Why mobile antennas are tiny but radio antennas look like towers – How a prosthetic arm reads muscle activity Everything leads to real-world use. You build machines and circuits, test them, debug them, and watch them run. That is EE’s biggest strength — you see results quickly. Career options are wide, starting from consumer electronics, renewable energy, automobiles, telecom, defence, aviation, medical devices, manufacturing, power plants, and roles in ISRO or Tesla-type companies.

In a first, the Ministry has shared a total of 6,28,305 (6.28 lakh) are enrolled at the school-level. In the previous year, MEA had reported 13.3 lakh students in higher education alone, which means that the 2025 figure marks a decline in university-level enrolments year-on-year. When considering the combined tally of school and higher education students, the overall 2025 number is higher only because school data was added for the first time. The top three destinations in 2025 across both schooling and university education were the United Arab Emirates (2,53,832 students), the United States (2,55,447 students), and Canada (4,27,085 students), making them the largest hubs of Indian students globally. MEA data shows a trend, that the number of Indian students in higher education overseas had risen consistently between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, there were 7.5 lakh students abroad in universities; this increased to 9.3 lakh in 2023 and reached a peak of 13.3 lakh in 2024. In contrast, the 2025 figure of 12.54 lakh shows a drop from last year, marking the first decline after three years of steady growth. This reversal comes at a time when several major destination countries have undergone significant policy shifts and diplomatic fluctuations affecting Indian student mobility over the past two years. Country-wise 2025 figures indicate that Canada continued to host the largest number of Indian students in universities and other tertiary institutions, with 4,27,085 enrolled. The United States followed with 2,55,247 students, and the United Kingdom had 1,73,190 students in higher education.

A question on the high dropout rate in Delhi government schools was asked by Swati Maliwal to the Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha during the Winter Session of the Parliament. Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system. To support their continued learning, NIOS enables such students to rejoin formal schooling in their parent institution once they successfully complete Class 10 through NIOS, said the Minister in the Rajya Sabha . The failing rate case also stands true for Class 10 students.

That is when we realised that they had not paid their fees,” an AMU official said, adding that a clear picture of the number of students who did not pay fees is yet to emerge. “In the case of some students, they have collected their degrees.

These recommendations strengthen the government’s commitment to provide effective employment opportunities for Gujarat’s youth, who play a key role in the country’s development, it stated. Implementing these recommendations will complete the recruitment process within a year, ensure timely and transparent jobs, quickly fill long-pending vacancies, and realise the state government’s vision, improving administrative efficiency and public service delivery, the release noted. The GARC’s suggestions include drawing a 10-year recruitment calendar, completion of the job process within a fixed time frame, conducting joint recruitment and the Common Central Test (CET) and greater adoption of computer-based examinations, among others. The report said the government should estimate a 10-year recruitment calendar for each department based on future needs, identify priority emergency services and critical cadres, and recruit them promptly.

The new law will take effect next year, making Chile the latest country to restrict smartphone use among young students to reduce its harmful effects and curb classroom distractions. Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year. In response to rising concerns about young people and their mental health, parents and teachers in Chile have lobbied for such a law for years, arguing that the use of smartphones impairs students’ learning and emotional development.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank.

The restriction on recruitment under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Reservation of Seats in Education Institutions and Appointments of Posts and Services under the State) Act, 2022, will remain until further orders. However, the HC bench allowed the government to continue recruitment processes already notified before November 19, 2025, even if they follow the increased reservation percentages. The court also clarified that all appointments made through these ongoing recruitments will be subject to the final outcome of the petitions challenging the law. The division bench of Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C M Poonacha issued the interim order on November 27 while hearing two PILs filed by Mahendra Kumar Mitra of Raichur and Mahesh of Bengaluru . The petitions question the constitutional validity of the 2022 Act, particularly the hike in SC/ST reservation, from 15 per cent to 17 per cent for SCs and from 3 per cent to 7 per cent for STs. Other Backward Classes (OBCs) reservation continues to remain at 32 per cent, which takes over all reservations in the state to 56 per cent. The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve.

Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause. Also Read | US universities saw 17% drop in enrolments from international students in 2025-26 Adding to the uncertainty is speculation about the future of Optional Practical Training (OPT) , the 36-month work authorisation that has long been central to the ROI of a US STEM degree. Several proposals have been discussed, which, if implemented, would be detrimental to Indian students. Since OPT is the bridge that enables practical experience, employability, and loan repayment, these discussions around changes signal instability and intensify risk assessments.

Indian students without practical experience or an industry-aligned portfolio face a steeper climb in securing OPT roles. Rent, transport, insurance, and daily expenses frequently exceed university estimates, pushing actual expenses beyond what most families anticipate and complicating loan affordability. Paradoxically, Indian students continue to remain the largest international student group in the US, as per the Open Doors Report 2025.

The FTC denied a request to cancel that ban made by Scott Zuckerman, the founder of consumer spyware company Support King and its subsidiaries SpyFone and OneClickMonitor. On Monday, the FTC announced the denial in a press release after Zuckerman petitioned the federal watchdog to rescind or modify the ban order in July of this year. In 2021, the FTC banned Zuckerman from “offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,” effectively preventing him from running another stalkerware business. The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. “SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.” In his petition , Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition. When reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.

The Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor , to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales , CNBC reported. H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported. An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump’s hands . The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security. Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years. The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips. While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.

The tech giant says the idea behind the new feed is to display recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with. The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms. It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident. TechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.” The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors.

The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness. During that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.” PIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported . In 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups , according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations. When interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way . After the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund , and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role , while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.

More than 230 organizations, including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. “The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. Several studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills. Electricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade. The effects are expected to be felt most in a handful of states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are slated for the largest increase in data center capacity. Energy demand for data centers is expected to nearly triple in the coming decade, up from 40 gigawatts today to 106 gigawatts in 2035.

It's part of a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could reshape software workflows.", "content": "Anthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests. The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work. Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots. For Slack, positioning itself as an “ agentic hub ” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work. By letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows. While Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic.

However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months. The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content. What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page. “This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins.

This builds upon an existing partnership between OpenAI and Instacart; more than two years ago, Instacart launched an in-app AI search tool powered by ChatGPT, which helps shoppers ask questions about what to make for dinner or how to accommodate dietary restrictions. The relationship between OpenAI and Instacart seems to have only deepened after former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo — who was already an OpenAI board member — joined the company as the CEO of Applications in May. Agentic commerce — the use of AI tools to do shopping research and make purchases on a user’s behalf — is a current priority for OpenAI. Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT . In an early preview for developers, ChatGPT launched integrations with apps like Booking.com, Canva, Coursera, Expedia, Figma, Spotify, and Zillow; since then, OpenAI has announced further partnerships with Target , Intuit , and others. Leading up to this year’s holiday shopping season, both OpenAI and Perplexity announced in-app features that help users make decisions about what products to buy — so, you could ask ChatGPT to help you find the best deal on a gaming laptop that matches your specific criteria. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season. Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “ small fee ” when it helps merchants make a sale.

The new round was led by Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize with participation from Alumni Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. Veery Maxwell at Galvanize will be joining the board, as will former Nest CFO Tom vonReichbauer. (The latter should come as no surprise given that many Quilters used to work at Nest.) The new funding will go toward expanding the company’s footprint.

Discovery (WBD), days after Warner agreed to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7 billion. Paramount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share. Paramount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. CNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago. “We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement . Paramount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo. Netflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months. Netflix’s proposed deal has already raised antitrust questions, as it would combine two of the most popular streaming platforms into one. Additionally, President Donald Trump has said the deal “could be a problem” because of the size of the combined companies’ market share. A deal between WBD and Paramount would also likely raise similar concerns. Netflix agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if the deal doesn’t go through.

Confluent offers a platform that helps enterprises manage streams of data in real time, a use case that’s exploded in demand as ever more companies develop and deploy AI products, which require significant back-and-forth processing of data for inferencing. IBM said Confluent will complement its existing data and automation products, as well as improve upon its existing offerings across AI, automation, data, and consulting. The company expects the deal to add to EBITDA and free cash flow in the two years after the deal is closed. This is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant’s largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024. IBM in October signed a deal with AI lab Anthropic to deploy the Claude large language model into some of its products; it has partnered with AMD to develop a new computing architecture that combines quantum systems with AI-specialized chips; and it acquired data analysis startup Seek AI in June.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?” To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games. Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives. However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do.

The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google. The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index , the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers. The AI giant has committed $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. “If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.” OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving.

The self-deepfaking feature was called “cameo,” and with that standout feature, Sora quickly rose to the top of Apple’s iOS download charts. This feature name led to a trademark lawsuit with Cameo , the app where fans can pay celebrities to record personalized videos. Now, because of the legal action, OpenAI has temporarily scrubbed the “cameo” branding from its Sora app . The app now refers to the feature as “characters.” Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI , which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. In addition to being told to remove “cameo” from Sora, OpenAI was also recently ordered not to call its upcoming hardware device “io,” in response to a separate lawsuit from a company named “iyO” that’s already building an AI-powered hardware device.

Discussions between Cameo and OpenAI have been “pretty nonexistent,” according to Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo. “They clearly knew Cameo existed. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “They chose the name anyway.” He sees this lawsuit as an “existential” battle over the word “cameo” and the app’s brand he has built over the past eight years. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic persona", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/openai-cameo-products-that-already-exist/", "timestamp": 1765246273.872937}

From tiny, $25 devices that will fit in a pocket, to massive, $400-plus boom boxes that require a built-in handle or shoulder strap, there’s a Bluetooth speaker for nearly every budget and gathering size. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for yet another model, as JBL proves with its new $100 JBL Grip. It’s essentially a smaller and lighter version of the company’s hugely popular Flip series, placing it between the Flip 7 and the JBL Go 4/Clip 5 on the portability scale. For some folks, that’s going to be the goldilocks zone. But just to sweeten the deal, JBL has reached into its toolbox and given the Grip an integrated LED light show, clearly inspired by the brand’s popular PartyBox lineup of party speakers. In keeping with JBL’s colorful approach to its smallest speakers, the Grip is available in red, white, black, purple, “squad” (a camo motif), and blue (pictured here). It’s 32 percent smaller than the JBL Flip 7— but it’s the Grip’s weight that will make throwing it in a backpack feel like an easy decision: At 0.8 pounds, the Grip is less than half the weight of the Flip 7 (1.8 pounds), making it light enough to hang from tree branches that would buckle under the Flip 7. JBL Grip Rating: 7/10 Despite the Grip’s smaller size, JBL pegs battery life on both speakers at the same 14-hour maximum. On the Grip at least, that might be overpromising. When I ran the speaker at 50 percent volume continuously, I only got about 10.5 hours. Using JBL’s PlayTime Boost mode could help if you really need to eke out a few more songs. The familial similarities continue with the Grip’s ability to withstand the elements. Like the Flip 7, it’s rated IP68, making it effectively dust- and waterproof. They’re both shockproof, and yet the Grip is arguably more durable, since both ends are solid silicone rubber.

Runners laced up one of the few models available and made it work, whatever the terrain. However, in 2025, it’s all very different. We now have running shoes tailored to every type of run: daily trainers, carbon racers, easy-day recovery shoes, speed session super trainers, tempo shoes. Trail running isn’t immune to the endless subcategories, and the newest niche is gravel shoes—a subset of trail running shoes designed specifically for mixed-terrain runs across compacted gravel paths, forest roads, hard-pack trails, and regular old roads. But are the brands just repackaging trail running shoes with smaller lugs? Or do gravel shoes genuinely offer something new and different?

Salomon REI (Men's) REI (Women's) Backcountry (Men's) Backcountry (Women's) If you’re recently been scouting for the best running shoes for trail, chances are you’ll have stumbled across gravel shoes. You’d be forgiven for wondering what they are. Gravel running shoes are basically hybrid running shoes built to handle multiterrain runs. They’re designed to let you run off-road—just not too far off the beaten track and certainly not onto the trickiest mountain slopes. The big selling point: They’re versatile enough to cruise compacted gravel (of course), forest tracks, hard-packed park and river paths, light uneven trails, and even the road commute to get there. “Gravel is a fairly new category,” says Taylor Bodin, chief trail shoe tester for Believe in the Run . “It is meant to be versatile in the sense that it can traverse lighter terrain more efficiently. This could mean anything from a door-to-trail shoe to a light trail shoe.” Gravel shoes blend the technologies and design of road and trail, mixing some of the cushion, impact pr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-gravel-running-shoes/", "timestamp": 1765246275.1124108}

Players walk clockwise in a circle. When the music stops, everyone sits in a chair. Big Tech is setting in motion its plans for the next gen of lead designers, engineers, AI chiefs, and even CEOs. In Cupertino, Apple execs with familiar faces are retiring or reducing responsibilities. Who’s in and who’s out? Well, chief operating officer Jeff Williams retired in November, and the speculation is that CEO Tim Cook could follow in the near term. Lisa Jackson, who has led Apple’s sustainability efforts since 2013, is now set to retire in January too. There’s also the squad of Apple staffers who have been lured away to work with OpenAI , notably Apple’s former chief design officer Jony Ive after his independent stint at LoveFrom . In 2024, Molly Anderson was named industrial design leader, heading up a team of mostly fresh faces. Others have gone to Meta, such as Apple’s VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, who just this week was poached to head up a new Reality Labs design studio. At Apple, he’s been replaced by longtime UI designer Stephen Lemay. Phew. In this swirl of shifting talent, John Ternus, who has worked for Apple since 2001, and served as SVP of hardware engineering for the last four years, reporting directly to Tim Cook, is emerging as the front-runner to succeed Cook as Apple CEO, reportedly as soon as next year. WIRED asked Apple for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. Alongside a steady drip of “leaks” on succession planning and Ternus’ position at the front of the pack, since 2023, Ternus has been given more prominence at product launch events. He announced the iPhone Air onstage this past September, and has appeared alongside other senior Apple leaders in press interviews and in-store Apple events. “I think they're testing to see what sentiment is like.

Here’s a test for infants: Show them a glass of water on a desk. Hide it behind a wooden board. Now move the board toward the glass. If the board keeps going past the glass, as if it weren’t there, are they surprised? Many 6-month-olds are, and by a year, almost all children have an intuitive notion of an object’s permanence, learned through observation. Now some artificial intelligence models do too. Researchers have developed an AI system that learns about the world via videos and demonstrates a notion of “surprise” when presented with information that goes against the knowledge it has gleaned. The model, created by Meta and called Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), does not make any assumptions about the physics of the world contained in the videos. Nonetheless, it can begin to make sense of how the world works. “Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting,” says Micha Heilbron , a cognitive scientist at the University of Amsterdam who studies how brains and artificial systems make sense of the world. As the engineers who build self-driving cars know, it can be hard to get an AI system to reliably make sense of what it sees. Most systems designed to “understand” videos in order to either classify their content (“a person playing tennis,” for example) or identify the contours of an object—say, a car up ahead—work in what’s called “pixel space.” The model essentially treats every pixel in a video as equal in importance. But these pixel-space models come with limitations. Imagine trying to make sense of a suburban street. If the scene has cars, traffic lights and trees, the model might focus too much on irrelevant details such as the motion of the leaves. It might miss the color of the traffic light, or the positions of nearby cars. “When you go to images or video, you don’t want to work in [pixel] space because there are too many details you d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-one-ai-model-creates-a-physical-intuition-of-its-environment/", "timestamp": 1765246275.3619983}

Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider ) had \"Norwegian kaiju\" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating \"Megatroll\" it has locked away. Soon, Nora—reunited with allies Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Major Kris Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen)—is caught in another desperate race to prevent a trollpocalypse. This time though, there's an edge of Indiana Jones at work, with a madcap ancient conspiracy to decode alongside the troll-smashing action. Troll 2 is a bit more tongue-in-cheek than its predecessor, and ventures into so-bad-it's-good territory in places, but it knows exactly what it is and what it's offering: giant rock monsters beating the boulders off of each other.

You could take all of your games with you, install mods and custom software, or even plug into a hub and get some work done. Lenovo is taking another swing at the Windows handheld game with the Legion Go 2, undeterred by mixed reviews on the original Legion Go and streamlined Legion Go S .

If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I’d recommend picking something a little lower maintenance. I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand. Lenovo Go Gen 2 Rating: 7/10 Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings. It’s unique, and the easy access to a mouse and right-click without using the touchpad is a nice bonus, but the way you grip the controller means you're always kind of palming the joystick on the side.

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain . By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity . The present crisis reflects not only this summer’s extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry. The drought quickly disrupted Tehran’s urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank . Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation , and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved . These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran’s infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress. These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer. Over the past five years, precipitation during this wet period has remained consistently below the long-term climatological baseline, with the 2024-25 season showing the most pronounce", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/why-tehran-is-running-out-of-water-iran-climate-change-drought-extreme-weather/", "timestamp": 1765246275.884073}

Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept —a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell. British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing. Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new . Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn’t until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings. Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet Rating: 9/10 RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila! The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company’s name, RLS, or “Relea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/canyon-deflectr-rls-bike-helmet/", "timestamp": 1765246276.0074155}

Expressive Captions now have the relevant emotion tags, and they’re rolling out in English-speaking YouTube videos as well as across Android. Configurable AutoClick for mouse users reduces strain, Guided Frame is now more descriptive about what’s in the camera's view on the Pixel camera app, and you can launch Voice Access with a voice command to Gemini. Fast Pair for hearing aids is also expanding (now available for Demant, Starkey support coming in early 2026), and better voice dictation with TalkBack is coming soon. These features are coming to Pixel devices first, but will follow to third-party devices in time. Google is also showing some love to older versions of Android, with features that aren’t 16-specific, such as Emoji Kitchen stickers, the ability to leave and report group chats in Google Messages, the option to check for scams with Circle to Search, and pinned tabs in Chrome just like on desktop.

But Horses fails to meet the lofty goals of its own ideas.", "content": "Shortly before the December 2 release of horror game Horses , developer Santa Ragione shared some news: The game would not be available on Valve’s mega platform, Steam . Valve had already banned an early, incomplete version of the game two years ago and offered, according to Santa Ragione , little clarification about why at the time. Then, hours before the game’s release, the Epic Games Store banned Horses as well. A day after the game’s launch, distribution platform Humble removed, and then later relisted, the title. The public swiftly spoke out against these bans, and community support for the game’s developers has been plentiful. Many pieces have been written online about how the game doesn’t deserve to be shunned by the distribution platforms, and about how the game’s content is relatively tame . But too few of these pieces engage with the content of the game on a critical level. Horses ’ storytelling is clumsy, and its blasé treatment of the sexual assaults (plural!) depicted in the game fails to elevate the game beyond more than a lazy commentary of sexual repression. It’s difficult to untangle the circumstances and controversy surrounding the game’s release from the content of the game itself. As a writer, I think censorship of creative work is Bad. I think Horses has as much right to exist as any other game, and that the power of distribution platforms to ban and delist a game by a small studio should be a concern for everyone. But the real problem with Horses is not that it’s too audacious for what is clearly intended to be an adult audience. Horses , for all the attention around its banning, is tedious and overreliant on pseudo-intellectual ideas. It confuses its own pretension for something profound. Even its shock value eventually wears off, making its three-hour run time feel like a slog. Conversations about whether or not it deserves the scandal are ultimately useless and wholly subjective.

Fashion has been her obsession since she was a Syracuse high schooler inhaling spreads in Seventeen and hanging out in local malls. So she felt well-positioned to create a company for customers to discover the perfect garments using AI. The reality was much harder than she expected. I had breakfast recently with Bornstein and her CTO, Maria Belousova, to learn about her startup, Daydream , funded with $50 million from VCs like Google Ventures. The conversation took an unexpected turn as the women schooled me on the surprising difficulty of translating the magic of AI systems into something people actually find useful.T Her story helps explain something. My first newsletter of 2025 announced that it would be The Year of the AI App . Though there are indeed many such apps, they haven’t transformed the world as I anticipated. Ever since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, people have been blown away by the tricks performed by AI, but study after study has shown that the technology has not yet delivered a significant boost in productivity. (One exception: coding.) A study published in August found that 19 out of 20 AI enterprise pilot projects delivered no measurable value. I do think that productivity boost is on the horizon, but it’s taking longer than people expected. Listening to the stories of startups like Daydream that are pushing to break through gives some hope that persistence and patience might indeed make those breakthroughs happen. Bornstein’s original pitch to VCs seemed obvious: Use AI to solve tricky fashion problems by matching customers with the perfect garments, which they’d be delighted to pay for.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

A scenario where a parent asks someone on an airplane to switch seats so they can sit next to their young child is likely to invoke the same rush of anger. But those posts may trigger a Reddit moderator’s annoyance for a different reason—they are common themes within a growing genre of AI -generated, fake posts. These are examples that spring to mind for Cassie, one of dozens of moderators for r/AmItheAsshole . With over 24 million members, it's one of the biggest subreddits, and it explicitly bans AI-generated content and other made-up stories. Since late 2022, when ChatGPT first launched to the public, Cassie (who wanted to be referred to by first name only) and other people who volunteer their time to moderate Reddit posts have been struggling with an influx of AI content. Some of it is entirely AI-generated, while other users have taken to editing their posts and comments with AI programs like Grammarly. “It’s probably more prevalent than anybody wants to really admit, because it’s just so easy to shove your post into ChatGPT and say ‘Hey, make this more exciting,’” says Cassie, who thinks as much as half of all content being posted to Reddit may have been created or reworked with AI in some way. r/AmItheAsshole is a pillar of Reddit culture, a format that has inspired dozens if not hundreds of derivatives like r/AmIOverreacting, r/AmITheDevil, and r/AmItheKameena, a subreddit with over 100,000 members described as “Am I the asshole, but the Indian version.” Posts tend to feature stories about interpersonal conflicts, where Redditors can weigh in on who is wrong (“YTA” means “You’re the asshole,” while “ESH” means “Everyone sucks here”), who is right, and what the best course of action to take is moving forward.

The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1765246277.957201}

The “overwhelming majority” of the images involved nudity and were “depicted adult content,” according to the researcher who uncovered the exposed trove of data, with some appearing to depict children or the faces of children swapped onto the AI-generated bodies of nude adults. Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos.

When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building.

Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

Lavingia joined the IRS in November. In a conversation at WIRED’s Big Interview event with former acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration Leland Dudek and David Foote, outside counsel for the US Institute of Peace, Lavingia said, “I'm working at IRS for online accounts.” Lavingia said that he joined as a career employee after Sam Corcos, a DOGE operative and the chief information officer of the Treasury Department, reached out to him after reading an article he'd written about his experience in government, offering to put him in touch with people who could help him find a role in which he could put his talents to use as a federal worker. When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should. Lavingia was previously assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), where he was part of a group of technologists brought into the government in the early months of DOGE’s takeover. In 2015, he had applied to be a part of the US Digital Service (USDS), now the US DOGE Service . Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work. At the VA, Lavignia attempted to use an AI tool to write code for the agency’s systems and suggested the agency move away from paper forms entirely. He built a tool to “munch” data about the agency’s contracts to identify those that could be cut. He was fired from his role at the VA in May after he spoke to a reporter about his work at DOGE. Lavingia told WIRED at the time that he really believed in the role of technology to try and make government services better, but he quickly became disillusioned w", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-sahil-lavingia/", "timestamp": 1765246279.441033}

The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday. The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command’s classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.” The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate , because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security . The IG report notes that Hegseth is the “head original classification authority in the DOD” and therefore decides what information needs to be classified and whether to declassify information. “We concluded that the Secreta", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/signalgate-inspector-general-report-hegseth-change/", "timestamp": 1765246279.5683}

But It Might Not Work", "summary": "By rolling back auto industry fuel efficiency goals, US president Donald Trump hopes to make new cars cheaper. But prices won’t drop for years, and consumers will spend more on gas in the meantime.", "content": "The Trump administration says its proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, announced officially in the Oval Office on Wednesday, is an attempt to shave dollars off the ballooning cost of new cars in the US. But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change. The Biden administration took a carrot-and-stick approach to vehicles and their effect on the environment. Light-duty cars and trucks alone are responsible for some 15 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The previous administration tried to boost electric vehicle adoption by using tax subsidies for consumers and manufacturers interested in building fuel-efficient vehicles and technologies, including batteries. It also introduced penalties for those unable or unwilling to meet stricter environmental standards. Automakers should be able to hit next decade’s goals by selling more electric vehicles, the government then reasoned.

Eric Topol Hopes So", "summary": "The author of Super Agers believes AI could bring big changes to the world of medicine.", "content": "For decades now, it’s been fairly well established that once you turn 40 you should start paying more attention to your body. That’s when women are supposed to start getting mammograms and men are supposed to start paying a bit more attention to their prostates. Over the next decade, you’ll start getting colonoscopies, and from then on out, it feels like a gradual march of doctor’s appointments and tests until your body collapses sometime in your seventies or eighties. But what if modern medicine has the timeline all wrong? What if we’re testing some middle-aged people unnecessarily for diseases they’ll most likely never get, while blindly ignoring twentysomethings who might be prone to colon cancer? Is there a way that, even as we age, we can stay healthy in a way that’s both meaningful and not reliant on taking 12 horse-sized pills every morning? Eric Topol certainly thinks so. The cardiologist, vice president of Scripps Research, and author of Super Agers is convinced that new innovations in AI-assisted medicine, bioengineering, and anti-inflammatory awareness could have potential to revolutionize the way people age. During WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday, Topol told features editor Sandra Upson that while he was working on Super Agers he learned that there’s a difference between lifespan and health span and that neither has much to do with genetics. Someone who’s “wellderly,” or over 65 and generally healthy, has pretty much the same genetic makeup as someone who’s elderly and facing major health challenges, like heart disease, cancer, or a neurodegenerative disorder. Instead, Topol said, there appears to be a correlation between having a healthy immune system and aging healthily. Lifestyle can influence how healthy you are, too, with Topol advocating for eating a diet low in ultra-processed foods, focusing on sleep quality over sleep quantity, and getting out in nature. He also recommended getting exercise, focusing both on aerobic work", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-eric-topol-super-agers/", "timestamp": 1765246279.9106905}

The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically. I don't know what it's going to change to, but it's what I'm spending almost every waking hour thinking about.” As a company, Cloudflare’s offerings are geared toward making it faster and safer to access content online. But as the AI industry has exploded and AI giants have emerged, Prince says he’s become increasingly focused on how Cloudflare can leverage its position to discourage consolidation and safeguard the internet as a place where businesses and creators of every size can survive—or, ideally, thrive. “We need to be able to make sure that businesses large and small flourish on a fair playing ground,” Prince said. “That is the future that we're trying to play for.

The Department of Homeland Security has called her a \"criminal illegal alien.\" Ferreira's attorney. Todd Pomerleau, said that she was working on getting her green card. as per a NY Post report. Ferreira, who was born in Brazil, was living in the USA under provisions of the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) law introduced during the Obama administration, the lawyer said, as per the publication. “We argued that she wasn’t a danger or a flight risk,” he said in a text message to the Associated Press . “The government stipulated to our argument and never once argued that she was criminal illegal alien and waived appeal,” he added. As per a DHS official, the arrested Ferreira also has a criminal history. She was reportedly arrested for battery and for overstaying a visa that had expired back in June 1999. Pomerleau insisted that his client “has no criminal record whatsoever” and demanded proof of arrests from the DHS. On the other hand, Michael Leavitt, with whom she was earlier engaged, has said that their son has been living with him since his birth, a claim that Ferreira's lawyer has denied. Followng a complaint by the US government against ICEBlock , an app that allows users to share information on the sightings of ICE agents, Apple removed the same from its App Store.

He was 92. His niece, Susan Tremblay, told the NYT that the cause of Wilford's death was prostate cancer. John Wilford gave the NYT readers an awe-inspiring and comprehensive account of Apollo 11’s touchdown and exploratory mission on the moon’s arid Sea of Tranquillity under the front-page banner headline “MEN WALK ON MOON,” on 21 July 1969. “It was man’s first landing on another world,” he wrote, “the realisation of centuries of dreams, the fulfillment of a decade of striving, a triumph of modern technology and personal courage, the most dramatic demonstration of what man can do if he applies his mind and resources with single-minded determination.” He added: “The moon, long the symbol of the impossible and the inaccessible, was now within man’s reach, the first port of call in this new age of spacefaring.” John Wilford, a Kentucky-born journalist, worked at The Wall Street Journal and Time magazine before joining The Times in late 1965. He, according to the NYT, combined a passion for scholarship with a detective’s eye for detail and the literary skills of a master storyteller. Wilford's journalism career spanned six decades, coinciding with milestone discoveries in the mysteries of dinosaurs and early human life, as well as in space exploration. In 1965, Wilford was assigned his first major assignment for which he won a Times in-house publisher’s award — coverage of a maneuver by four astronauts on two spacecraft, Gemini 6 and Gemini 7. He called it “man’s first rendezvous in the vastness of outer space.” John Wilford's assignments led to several books, starting with “We Reach the Moon,” about America’s space program.

The government imposes a flat 30% tax on profits earned from cryptocurrency transactions; it also levies a separate 1% TDS on the transaction value each time a digital asset is bought or sold. The 1% TDS helps the tax department track transactions, while the 30% tax applies only to the gains made from them. The TDS collected on such transactions jumped up 41% in FY25, from ₹ 3.63 billion in FY24, according to Chaudhary's written response to a question raised in the Lok Sabha. Among Indian states with the highest cryptocurrency activity, Maharashtra and Karnataka together accounted for over 80% of crypto transactions, with state-wise TDS collection of ₹ 2.93 billion and ₹ 1.34 billion, respectively. The government has not carried out any studies for the implementation of taxation models for cryptocurrencies , as in other countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, Chaudhary said. To ensure anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing through these assets, the Financial Intelligence Unit registers all Virtual Asset Service Providers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Chaudhary said. “This registration requirement applies equally to domestic and offshore platforms that cater to users based in India,” he added. The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) classify cryptocurrencies as “virtual digital assets” rather than legal tender. While the government has not banned crypto, it remains largely unregulated, with limited oversight and taxation.

The decision, disclosed by President Trump on his Truth Social platform amounts to a strategic shift in Washington DC’s management of the technological rivalry between the world’s two largest economies. Under the arrangement, Nvidia may ship H200 processors to China on the condition that the US government receives a 25% surcharge. According to a Commerce Department official cited by Bloomberg , this payment will be collected as the chips move from Taiwanese manufacturing facilities to the United States , where they will undergo security inspection by the Bureau of Industry and Security before re-export. Trump argued publicly that the plan would “protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” while also insisting that more advanced systems—Nvidia’s Blackwell and Rubin families—are excluded from the deal. This framework represents a notable departure from the blanket restrictions introduced in 2022 to deny Beijing access to the most sophisticated American AI hardware. It also builds on an earlier, unrealised proposal under which Nvidia and AMD would remit 15% of revenue from China chip sales to the US Treasury. According to Bloomberg , officials had been weighing the H200 decision for weeks. The final compromise reflects both political calculus and strategic pragmatism. Nvidia had lobbied for access to China to recover what Chief Executive Jensen Huang described as a US$50 billion market opportunity, while lawmakers struggled to balance commercial interests with national-security imperatives.

This modification applies to specific groups of immigrants residing in the United States, including some individuals in the process of seeking permanent residency. However, the change is expected to affect those moving through the green card application process. Since December 5, USCIS has restricted the length of both new and renewal of EADs to a maximum of 18 months. Anyone who received an EAD before that date will keep the full validity originally granted, but when they apply for a renewal in the future, the updated 18-month limit will apply, according to a report by Newsweek.  According to Business Insider, these changes may lead to more frequent EAD renewals, which means additional filing fees, extra paperwork, and a heightened risk of employment interruptions if USCIS processing times stay slow. This could directly affect the job stability of green card applicants. To prepare, green card applicants—particularly those relying on an EAD while their adjustment of status is pending—should: 1. Submit their EAD renewal applications as early as possible; USCIS permits filing up to 180 days before expiration. 2. Organise all required documents in advance, such as their passport, I-485 receipt notice, and current EAD, and ensure their USCIS records are accurate. 3. Plan financially for potentially more frequent renewal fees. As of the time of publication, renewals can cost up to $605, though discounted rates are available for adjustment-of-status applicants. 4.

Blair has been quietly dropped from consideration for the proposed advisory group or ‘ board of peace ’, which Trump has said he would chair himself, according to The Financial Times (FT). Blair was the only name publicly mentioned for a possible role on the council when President Trump announced his 20-point plan to end the Israel–Hamas war in September. President Trump had praised Blair as a ‘very good man.’ A month later, however, Trump said, “I’ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he’s an acceptable choice to everybody.” However, Blair's name for the role sparked reactions from Arab and Muslim countries. While Blair’s supporters said he had helped end years of conflict in Northern Ireland , his critics argued that he did very little in his role as the representative of the “Quartet” — the UN, EU, US and Russia — which was meant to push for peace in the Middle East, according to a report in The Guardian Many people across the Arab world view Blair with suspicion and anger because of his support for the US-led Iraq invasion in 2003. Reports about Blair's withdrawal come despite claims that he had an unpublicized meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late November to discuss plans, according to a report in The Times of Israel . The Financial Times report suggests, quoting sources, that Blair could still play a less central role in the proposed plan. Blair’s office has not yet commented on the reports.

The recent takeover of areas in Hadhramaut province by the Southern Transitional Council reflects a rift in forces aligned against the Houthi rebels who have taken most of the country’s north, including the capital, Sanaa. Since 2014, Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war pitting the Iranian-backed Houthis against an internationally recognized government, which is supported by a Saudi-led military coalition. The separatist Southern Transitional Council is part of the anti-Houthi camp, but it seeks an independent state in southern Yemen. A Yemeni government official said Monday that the Saudi-led coalition had withheld permission for flights, including those to and from the southern city of Aden , the seat of the internationally recognized government. The official described the move as a “Saudi message” to the separatists, following their latest takeover of areas in the sprawling oil-rich province of Hadhramaut, which borders Saudi Arabia. The escalation could lead to Yemen being split into two states after more than three decades of unification. Saudi Arabia didn’t acknowledge closing Yemen’s airspace on Monday. Since the entry of a Saudi-led coalition into Yemen’s war in 2015, the coalition has controlled the country’s airspace. Hundreds of passengers were stranded for hours before flight operations resumed, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to brief the media. An Associated Press journalist at the airport saw workers begin processing passengers of a Cairo-bound flight that was supposed to take off early Monday.

The victim, Michael Virgil, aged 35, died in December 2024 while in custody aboard the ship, the lawsuit claims. His family alleges that on the day he died, crew members continued serving him alcohol at one of the ship’s bars, despite what they describe as clearly disturbing behaviour. The lawsuit contends that this excessive serving directly contributed to his worsening condition. According to court filings — as reported by media outlets — Virgil was later detained onboard following what is described as a “drunken rage,” during which he allegedly threatened crew members and other passengers. It was after this confrontation that his condition worsened and a medical emergency ensued. Following an investigation, the cause of death has been officially ruled a homicide. The family’s wrongful death lawsuit holds Royal Caribbean and the ship’s staff responsible for the events leading up to Virgil’s death. They argue that the company failed in its duty of care by allowing the continued supply of alcohol, ignoring signs of intoxication and negligence in handling a vulnerable passenger. Officially, neither Royal Caribbean nor any of its representatives have responded publicly to the lawsuit (as of the date of this writing). The family’s attorneys, however, insist they will seek full accountability, including compensatory damages for emotional distress and loss, and punitive damages aimed at prompting stronger safety protocols for cruise passengers.

As per the email, which Aaron shared with AP in October, Apple mentioned the app flouted the company’s policies “because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group\".

The move marks one of the most significant structural shifts for the brand in years, prompting questions about its future direction and long-term viability. Founded in 1953, Denny’s became legendary for its round-the-clock dining, comfort-food classics, and its role as a go-to stop for families, night-shift workers, students and travellers. The brand built a devoted following with dishes like the Grand Slam Breakfast, bottomless coffee , and its reliably open doors—even on holidays.  At its peak, the chain operated well over 2,000 restaurants nationwide. But shifting consumer habits, rising operating costs and increased competition from faster, cheaper breakfast outlets have steadily eroded its footprint. Much of Denny’s cultural staying power comes from the menu items that became synonymous with the brand. The Grand Slam Breakfast, introduced in the 1970s, remains its most iconic dish—an abundant plate of eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes designed to deliver classic American comfort. The chain is also known for its Moons Over My Hammy sandwich, a cult favourite packed with ham, scrambled eggs and Swiss cheese, as well as its signature Build Your Own Slam, which allowed customers to tailor their breakfast exactly how they wanted. Other staples—including the Chicken-Fried Steak, the Country-Fried Bacon, and stacks of syrupy buttermilk pancakes—helped define Denny’s as a place where indulgence, familiarity and value converged. Even its endless cups of coffee became a symbol of the brand, fuelling travellers through overnight drives and keeping night-shift workers company in the quiet early hours.

State-run Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked transmission connectivity approvals for 6.3GW of green power capacity over delays in project development, Union minister of state for power Shripad Naik said on Monday. In a written reply to a query in Rajya Sabha, the minister said there were 16 petitions pending before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) that pertain to cases where the power generators have approached the regulator seeking protection from revocation of connectivity. \"Since 2022, Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked connectivity of 24 grantees with a renewable energy (RE) capacity of 6,343MW. The cancellations are on account of developer delays and not due to transmission side delays,\" the minister said. An Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for the evacuation of 172 GW of renewable energy is already under construction, and bids are in process for 19 GW capacity, he added. The Centre is also working with the states to ensure timely development of respective intra-state transmission systems for the evacuation of 152GW of renewable energy . \"These efforts, together with the planned transmission systems for integrating hydro, nuclear, and other non-fossil capacities, collectively provide a clear implementation plan for achieving the 500 GW non-fossil capacity target,\" the minister said. The statement comes at a time when the renewable energy sector has been affected by curtailing of power generation and piling unsigned power purchase agreements. Mint had earlier reported that solar power producers in Rajasthan have dialled down production, after a congested grid prompted the regional regulator to step in. A total of nearly 44GW of renewable power is yet to find buyers and power purchase agreements have not been signed.

At a time when Donald Trump's $100,000 H1-B visa fee hike has left a lot of foreign workers in the US on edge – San Francisco based firm Metaview founder's comment has taken everyone by surprise. Shahriar Tajbakhsh, co-founder and chief technology officer of Metaview – made the ‘$100,000 per day’ remark while responding to a X user's comment that the H-1B visa fee should be set at $100,000 annually rather than as a one-time payment.

The court’s conservative justices hinted they might overturn a 90-year-old ruling that restricts when presidents can dismiss agency board members, or significantly weaken its impact, according to AP . Administration lawyers are defending Trump’s move to dismiss Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rebecca Slaughter without cause and are urging the Court to overturn the unanimous 1935 Humphrey’s Executor decision. The case was heard on Monday. Arguments at the court ended after 2.5 hours, reports noted. The court’s six conservative justices have already indicated firm backing for the administration’s stance. Despite objections from the three liberal justices, they permitted Slaughter and other agency board members to be dismissed while their lawsuits are still underway. Trump has also removed officials from the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The FTC is tasked with safeguarding the American public from deceptive or unfair business practices. It has taken on tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Meta (Facebook’s parent company) over concerns about their market dominance, as per AFP . The FTC is led by five commissioners, usually representing both major political parties, with a chair appointed by the president. Solicitor General John Sauer, speaking for the administration, urged the justices to overturn the landmark 1935 ruling known as \"Humphrey's Executor,\" which barred then president Franklin Roosevelt from removing a member of the FTC, a report by AFP noted.

The incident — which is said to have occurred on December 5 at a Miraj Cinemas location — has raised concerns about public safety and appropriate behaviour in shared spaces. In the video, the man seated in the front row of the cinema hall is seen smoking a cigarette and consuming alcohol, disturbing others with the smoke and smell. The situation escalated quickly after theatre staff approached the man, confronted him and, following a brief exchange, escorted him out of the auditorium. Their prompt action received loud applause and cheers from fellow moviegoers. Under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COTPA) , smoking is strictly prohibited in public areas such as cinema halls, auditoriums and other entertainment venues across India. Anyone caught violating the rule may face a penalty of up to ₹ 200. Cinemas are legally required to display clear “No Smoking” notices, and management can also be held responsible if they fail to enforce the ban. The clip spread rapidly across social media, where users criticised the man’s behaviour as reckless and lacking basic “civic sense”. Many pointed out the heightened risk of fire inside a dark, enclosed hall filled with flammable materials, noting that smoking inside such spaces is a serious breach of safety regulations. One user wrote, \"If your masculinity needs a cigarette and breaking rules at a public place, it was never strong to begin with. Get a life.\" Another commented, \"And sitting in the first row...

The Goa Police issued a statement on Monday, December 8 - day after the tragedy struck Goa club - and said that Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub owners fled to Phuket in Thailand at 5:30 am – hours after a massive fire erupted. They reportedly took an IndiGo airplane. Officials discovered the owners had fled after launching a large manhunt following the FIR. Immigration records revealed that the duo boarded IndiGo flight 6E 1073 to Phuket at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday, December 7 — just hours after the fire broke out around midnight. To arrest the owners of the Goa nightclub, the authorities have now sought the help of Interpol to trace and arrest the promoters. A senior official said that this swift exit by Luthras shows their “intent to avoid the police investigation.” The official said soon after an FIR was filed, police moved swiftly and dispatched a team to Delhi to conduct raids on the addresses of the two accused. “Since they were not available, a notice under appropriate sections of law was pasted on the gate of their house,” the official said. A Look Out Circular was also issued against both Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra by the Bureau of Immigration (BOI) at the request of the Goa Police. But as they were being tracked, the officials found that they had left Delhi for Phuket in the early hours of December 7. “Goa police have taken further steps to coordinate with the Interpol Division of CBI to apprehend both Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra at the earliest,” he said.

However, while the Centre claimed IndiGo had never raised any concerns about the new pilot rest rules, the airline stated that it had indeed requested more time to comply. Civil aviation minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu claimed IndiGo had already flown under the new flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules in all of November, rejecting the airline's attempt to link the December disruption to its rollout. He asserted that the meltdown stemmed from IndiGo’s own operational failures, not regulatory changes. IndiGo did not raise any red flag about the new rostering norms when a review was done in December, Naidu said. \"On 1 December, we had a meeting with IndiGo on FDTL itself when they required some clarifications. We have given the clarifications with that idea and they have not flagged this issue. Everything was running normal till then,\" Naidu said. “So, there was one full month of operations in the new FDTL norms... There have been a lot of internal complications. This is a day-to-day operations thing that IndiGo should have maintained. IndiGo was supposed to manage the crew, was supposed to manage the roster as part of their day-to-day operations. We are supposed to check if FDTL norms are maintained or not. And there has been no compromise on that,” the minister said in Rajya Sabha. “All airlines, and not just IndiGo, came back to the DGCA for variations depending on their nature of operations,” he said. “And post safety risk assessment, necessary variations, necessary exemptions were given beforehand itself.” To be sure, data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) shows IndiGo had cancelled 1,232 flights in November, a number which shot up to approximately 4,000 in December.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.
