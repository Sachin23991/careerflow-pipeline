The initiative is designed to help accredited employers fill seasonal roles more efficiently while ensuring safeguards remain in place to prevent misuse of the system. The new visas will specifically target industries that depend heavily on seasonal labour, including horticulture, agriculture, tourism, and hospitality.

The section on the Ghaznavid invasions is preceded by a box that contains “a word of caution”. The box is similar to the “note on history’s darker periods”, which was published in the class 8 textbook, placed before the chapter on the Delhi Sultanate. The box in the class 7 textbook refers to this note and states that it explains how history has recorded war, conquest and destruction more than peace, good governance or creativity, and how the world over historians have sometimes hesitated to draw attention to such darker periods. “Our approach is that it is better to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. In addition, we should not forget that while past events cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone responsible for them today,” it reads. The new textbook is meant for use in the ongoing academic session. Part 1 of the textbook was released earlier this year. The old NCERT class 7 history textbook had a paragraph on the Mahmud of Ghazni. It pointed out that rulers tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples, and chose to target temples which were sometimes extremely rich when they attacked kingdoms. It referred to the Mahmud of Ghazni as having raided the subcontinent 17 times with a religious motive, targeting wealthy temples and taking away their wealth. ‘The Ghaznavid Invasions’ section has about six pages including boxes and pictures.

As per the guidelines, only the top 2,50,000 successful candidates across all categories in the JEE Main 2026 BE/BTech paper will be shortlisted, in accordance with a fixed category-wise distribution. The institute has also reiterated conditions related to age, number of attempts and Class XII qualification. This year, the examination will be held on May 17, Sunday. Under Criterion A1, candidates must be among the top 2,50,000 performers in JEE Main 2026 (BE/BTech paper). The shortlisting for JEE Advanced follows a rigid category-wise percentage: 10% GEN-EWS, 27% OBC-NCL, 15% SC, 7.5% ST and 40.5% OPEN, with 5% horizontal reservation for PwD candidates within each of these categories. IIT Roorkee has clarified that the total may marginally exceed 2.5 lakh if “tied” ranks occur. IIT Roorkee has also noted that OCI/PIO (I) candidates are not eligible for any reserved category benefits, except under OPEN-PwD if applicable. They must qualify strictly in the OPEN lists. To be eligible, candidates must have been born on or after October 1, 2001. A relaxation of five years applies to SC, ST and PwD candidates, meaning they should have been born on or after October 1, 1996. Additionally, a candidate can appear for JEE Advanced only twice in two consecutive years, meaning prior attempts must fall within this two-year window. The exam maintains its long-standing rule of allowing only two attempts in two consecutive years. This means students must plan their Class 12 and JEE Main timelines carefully, as any earlier appearance than 2025 immediately disqualifies them from appearing in 2026.

This reversal comes at a time when several major destination countries have undergone significant policy shifts and diplomatic fluctuations affecting Indian student mobility over the past two years.

Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system. To support their continued learning, NIOS enables such students to rejoin formal schooling in their parent institution once they successfully complete Class 10 through NIOS, said the Minister in the Rajya Sabha .

That is when we realised that they had not paid their fees,” an AMU official said, adding that a clear picture of the number of students who did not pay fees is yet to emerge. “In the case of some students, they have collected their degrees. The committee is looking into these instances and determining the number of students who have left the institute without paying fees,” the official said.

GARC chairman Adhia, who is also Principal Advisor to the Gujarat government, handed over the report to Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel in Gandhinagar , an official release said. The commission has, till now, submitted five reports to the state government on different administrative aspects and this was the sixth one. The latest report outlines nine recommendations to make the recruitment process for government jobs faster, more transparent, technology-driven, and focused on youth, according to the release. These recommendations strengthen the government’s commitment to provide effective employment opportunities for Gujarat’s youth, who play a key role in the country’s development, it stated. Implementing these recommendations will complete the recruitment process within a year, ensure timely and transparent jobs, quickly fill long-pending vacancies, and realise the state government’s vision, improving administrative efficiency and public service delivery, the release noted. The GARC’s suggestions include drawing a 10-year recruitment calendar, completion of the job process within a fixed time frame, conducting joint recruitment and the Common Central Test (CET) and greater adoption of computer-based examinations, among others.

The new law will take effect next year, making Chile the latest country to restrict smartphone use among young students to reduce its harmful effects and curb classroom distractions. Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year. In response to rising concerns about young people and their mental health, parents and teachers in Chile have lobbied for such a law for years, arguing that the use of smartphones impairs students’ learning and emotional development.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank. Also Read | IIT Delhi BTech Placement Trends: Top-packages, companies Tests vary in difficulty with each session (so scores are not the same).

The restriction on recruitment under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Reservation of Seats in Education Institutions and Appointments of Posts and Services under the State) Act, 2022, will remain until further orders. However, the HC bench allowed the government to continue recruitment processes already notified before November 19, 2025, even if they follow the increased reservation percentages. The court also clarified that all appointments made through these ongoing recruitments will be subject to the final outcome of the petitions challenging the law. The division bench of Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C M Poonacha issued the interim order on November 27 while hearing two PILs filed by Mahendra Kumar Mitra of Raichur and Mahesh of Bengaluru .

The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country.

B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

While Paramount was assumed to be the frontrunner to acquire the storied movie studio thanks to CEO David Ellison’s connections to the Trump administration, new reporting in Bloomberg and The Hollywood Reporter suggests that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with President Donald Trump to discuss a potential deal in November. Trump reportedly told Sarandos that Warner Bros. should sell to the highest bidder, and the Netflix executive seems to have left the meeting convinced that the president would not immediately oppose the acquisition. After the initial stories about the meeting appeared on Sunday, Trump confirmed that the meeting took place . As for his feelings about the deal, he said, “Netflix is a great company. They’ve done a phenomenal job. Ted is a fantastic man. I have a lot of respect for him. But it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.” Bloomberg also reports that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav was reluctant to sell the company and was surprised when Paramount began to explore an acquisition — if nothing else, he’d expected Ellison to wait until the studio completed a planned split of its movie and streaming businesses from its cable networks. Ultimately, Warner Bros. said it would consider other bids, leading to a competitive process that Netflix won — although Paramount could still keep its hat in the ring with a hostile bid.

In its first fine under the European Union’s Digital Services Act , the commission called X’s blue checkmark system “deceptive” and said the paid verification system makes users vulnerable to impersonation and scams. The commission also said X’s advertising repository failed to meet the DSA’s requirements for transparency and accessibility. The commission said that X must respond within 60 days to its concerns about blue checkmarks, and within 90 days to the ad transparency violations, or it could face additional penalties. After the fine was announced, X owner Elon Musk described it as “bullshit” and also posted , “How long before the EU is gone? AbolishTheEU”. Now it seems X has penalized the commission’s account on the platform — not, the company says, because of the fine, but rather the commission’s use of X’s advertising system. Quoting the commission’s post announcing the fine, X’s Bier accused the EC of logging into a “dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer — to post a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach.” “As you may be aware, X believes everyone should have an equal voice on our platform,” Bier wrote . “However, it seems you believe that the rules should not apply to your account.” As a result, he said the commission’s ad account had been “terminated.” Bier subsequently said the exploit “has never been abused like this” and has since been patched.

At the moment, users are able to make crypto-to-crypto trades — but speaking at India Blockchain Week (IBW), Coinbase’s APAC director John O’Loghlen said the company will open up a fiat on-ramp in 2026, allowing users in India to load money and buy crypto. Coinbase opened up its services in India in 2022, and within days had to shut down support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment network . This move came after UPI operator National Payments Corporation (NPCI) refused to acknowledge Coinbase’s presence in the country . Later in 2023, Coinbase ceased all operations for Indian users and asked them to offload their accounts . “We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated. Because we wanted to kind of burn the boats [sic], have a clean slate here. As a commercial business person wanting to make money and active users, that’s like the worst thing you can do, and so you know it wasn’t without some hesitation,” O’Loghlen said. The company started engaging with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency that oversees transactions and fraud, and eventually registered with them this year. In October, it started to onboard users through early access, and now the app is open to all users. Many Internet companies have set up their base in India hoping to tap into the world’s second-largest online user base. While social platforms and AI companies like OpenAI have found rapid growth in the market, it has been hard for crypto companies to follow the same path because of strict regulations and taxation around cryptocurrencies. India levies a 30% tax on crypto income without any loss offset and also charges 1% deduction on each transaction, which could discourage users from trading frequently.

In response, the company said it was only testing ways to show apps built on the ChatGPT app platform that it announced in October , with “no financial component” to those suggestions.

People trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.” Earlier that same day, however, Chen responded in a more apologetic tone, acknowledging that the controversy isn’t just a matter of user confusion. “I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,” he wrote. “We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision.

But one portfolio company has captured an outsized share of his attention: xLight , a semiconductor startup that last Monday announced it has struck a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the U.S. Commerce Department, with the government set to become a meaningful shareholder. It’s a nice feather in the cap of Gelsinger, who spent 35 years across two stints at Intel before the board showed him the door late last year owing to a lack of confidence in his turnaround plans. But the xLight deal is also shining a spotlight on a trend that’s making people in Silicon Valley quietly uncomfortable: the Trump administration taking equity stakes in strategically important companies. “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” California Governor Gavin Newsom asked at a speaking event this week, capturing the unease that’s rippling through an industry that has long prided itself on its free-market principles. Speaking at one of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC events at Playground Global, Gelsinger — who is xLight’s executive chairman — seemed unbothered by the philosophical debate. He’s more focused on his bet that xLight can solve what he sees as the semiconductor industry’s biggest bottleneck: lithography, the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize chip manufacturing. If the technology works at scale, that is. “You know, I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said, referencing the decades-old principle that computing power should double every two years. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.” The xLight de", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/pat-gelsinger-wants-to-save-moores-law-with-a-little-help-from-the-feds/", "timestamp": 1765172136.2681363}

For example, Airtable said in June that “instead of just adding more A.I. capabilities to our existing platform, we treated this as a refounding moment for the company. The startup’s co-founder and CEO Howie Liu told the NYT that this is not a pivot because it’s not about changing direction after getting something wrong. Liu said the company considered calling it a relaunch or transformation, but ultimately chose “the language of founding because the stakes feel the same.” Similarly, Handshake’s chief marketing officer Katherine Kelly said the company is trying to bring startup culture “back into an existing business.” That can also mean harder work — Kelly said handshake told employees they have to be back in the office five days a week, “operating with a pace and number of hours that is meaningful and will help us hit goals.” Topics Show your CFO the marketing proof they want!

Rizzbot has more than a million followers (and 800 million views) across social media and is known for its comedic roasting of subjects, as well as giving people the middle finger. Speed, meanwhile, has more than 50 million followers (and 6 billion views ) across various platforms and is known for his dramatic behavior while livestreaming. What happened when the two parties met is the subject of a lawsuit that Rizzbot’s creators, Social Robotics, detailed in a petition filed in November against Speed, né Darren Jason Watkins Jr., his management company, Mixed Management, and another producer who was with Speed’s team that day. The petition, obtained by TechCrunch, alleges that Speed inflicted “irreparable damage” to Rizzbot. The lawsuit alleged that — and the livestream video shows that — Speed repeatedly punched Rizzbot in the face, put it in a chokehold, at one point pinned it to the couch, and threw it to the ground. “Speed absolutely knew that this was not an appropriate way to interact with a sophisticated robot and knew that such actions with inflict irreparable damage to Rizzbot,” the petition read. “These actions resulted in the total loss of the Rizzbot.” The petition read that Speed’s handling of the robot caused “complete loss of functionality,” and that Rizzbot had “significant damages” to its mouth and neck. “Additionally, the head cameras no longer function, the ports behind the neck which connect to robot’s sensors that allow it to see and hear are dead, and the robot is unstable and cannot walk straight any longer,” the petition alleges. The petition is asking for compensation for damages, including actual and lost profit, though Rizzbot’s legal team declined to comment on the dollar amount the owner is seeking.

It has gained immense popularity over the years, and as a result, many companies have seized the opportunity to create similar year-in-review experiences, offering users a recap of their habits, preferences, or interactions from the past year. Here are some platforms and websites that mimic the Spotify Wrapped concept. Amazon Music has a new Spotify Wrapped knockoff this year called “ 2025 Delivered ,” which offers a summary of users’ listening stats, such as top artists, songs, and even podcasts. Notably, the platform also takes advantage of Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, by giving users a special message from their favorite artist. The feature can be found on the app by tapping on the Library tab. This year’s update features new badges for listeners to showcase. For instance, the “Trendsetter” badge is given to those who listened to trending albums early, while the “Headliner” badge honors fans who rank among the top percentage of an artist’s listeners. There are also new shareable cards designed with a “music festival” theme, tailored specifically for each listener. Previously, Amazon Music’s equivalent of Spotify Wrapped was “My Year in Review,” a playlist featuring 50 to 100 of the most popular tracks based on your yearly statistics. The playlist is available in the “Playlists” section or “Made For You.” Apple’s music streaming service Apple Music first rolled out its “ Replay ” experience in 2019. The feature offers a summary of top songs, artists, albums, genres, playlists, and stations, including play counts, total time spent listening, and other insights. You can also share personalized listening data on social media, and a year-end highlight reel offers an audio and visual recap of the music you listened to the most throughout the year.

It comes after a $13.7 million Series A round announced in May, bringing the startup’s total funding to nearly $60 million. As AI tools spread into workplaces and fuel fears of automation, Yoodli positions itself differently. The four-year-old, Seattle-based startup uses AI to run simulated scenarios — including sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions — and provides users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills. Varun Puri (pictured above, right), who previously worked at Google’s X division and handled special projects for Sergey Brin, co-founded Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi (pictured above, left) in 2021. He became aware of communication challenges after moving to the U.S. at 18 and seeing how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals from countries such as India — himself included — Puri said in an interview.

Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors. Aaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment. The exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million. Aaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles. The startup’s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events.

The voluntary software recall will be filed early next week, according to the company. Waymo said as soon as the issue was identified it updated its software on November 17. The company contends this update has meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this important area. Software recalls have become more common in the age of modern passenger vehicles — and now robotaxis — in which operations are handled by software. These updates, or fixes, are often made prior to the official recall but still carry weight when filed with the federal government. Waymo’s decision follows increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism by officials in Atlanta and Austin over how its robotaxis perform around school buses. NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into Waymo in October after seeing footage of its autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. Other similar incidents popped up in Austin, where the company also operates a robotaxi service with partner Uber. Austin School District officials contend, in a letter available on NHTSA’s website, that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software.

NHTSA said in the letter it has received 62 complaints from Tesla drivers, 14 reports submitted by Tesla, and four media reports that describe potential violations. That’s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it opened an investigation into the behavior in October. The federal safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla’s driver assistance software can “accurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,” according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla’s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla’s responses are due January 19, 2026. The increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection.” The agency didn’t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts its own submissions to the agency. The new letter was sent to Tesla the same week that CEO Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that the latest version of FSD will allow drivers to text and drive while using the driver assistance software, which is illegal in nearly every state. NHTSA has not responded to requests for comment about Musk’s statement. The letter is meant to kick off the discovery process for NHTSA, and as such it details a number of requests for information the agency has made to Tesla. For instance, the agency is asking for data on how many Tesla vehicles are equipped with FSD, as well as how often the software is engage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/feds-find-more-complaints-of-teslas-fsd-running-red-lights-and-crossing-lanes/", "timestamp": 1765172137.8377223}

A few years earlier, he had lost 40 pounds with the help of an Apple Watch, which counted steps and tracked his calorie burn, and he began wondering if there was a similar device to assess his stress. “I wanted to lose 40 pounds of stress, and realized there’s no wearable for that today,” Forenza told TechCrunch. That’s when Forenza realized he’d stumbled onto a gap in the consumer health market. Drawing on his engineering background, he decided to build the device himself, using a more than century-old technology: the electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain. While EEG is used clinically to diagnose diseases such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, it can also detect psychological stress by measuring high-frequency brain waves called beta waves. When those rapid beta waves persist for extended periods, they can lead to exhaustion, insomnia, and mental distress. Forenza collaborated with data scientists and biomedical engineers to develop Awear , a small device worn behind the ear for continuous brainwave monitoring. The device transmits results to an app, which provides information about the wearer’s mood and offers AI-powered coaching advice for managing stress and improving emotional resilience. “Our brain is phenomenal at self-adjusting and makes us believe we are not stressed,” Forenza said. “It’s fine to be in ‘fight or flight’ every once in a while. It’s part of our nature. But if you fall into the trap of constant ‘fight or flight’, then that leads to chronic stress, depression, anxiety.” Forenza claims that Awear helps users proactively intercept excessive stress before it leads to negative health effects .

SpaceX has not responded to a request for comment; the WSJ not did report on the scale of the offering. The eye-popping figure reflects how routine mega-valuations have become within private markets. OpenAI stands at $500 billion, while Anthropic reportedly surged last month to $350 billion following major investments from Microsoft and Nvidia, up from $183 billion just months earlier. These companies can now achieve public-market-scale valuations while remaining private, fueled by secondary sales that provide liquidity without the scrutiny of quarterly earnings reports.

The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year. Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’ desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record. The startup, founded by Brett Bejcek and Dan Siroker, the co-founder and former chief executive of Optimizely , pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another ( not very well-received ) AI pendant known as Friend . According to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too. “When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different.

Laser printers use heat in the bonding process, which means if you regularly print on windowed envelopes or photo paper, you'll need to either use an ink printer or change to a thermally safe alternative, which can be cost prohibitive if you print a lot.

We now have running shoes tailored to every type of run: daily trainers, carbon racers, easy-day recovery shoes, speed session super trainers, tempo shoes. Trail running isn’t immune to the endless subcategories, and the newest niche is gravel shoes—a subset of trail running shoes designed specifically for mixed-terrain runs across compacted gravel paths, forest roads, hard-pack trails, and regular old roads. But are the brands just repackaging trail running shoes with smaller lugs? Or do gravel shoes genuinely offer something new and different?

Salomon REI (Men's) REI (Women's) Backcountry (Men's) Backcountry (Women's) If you’re recently been scouting for the best running shoes for trail, chances are you’ll have stumbled across gravel shoes. You’d be forgiven for wondering what they are. Gravel running shoes are basically hybrid running shoes built to handle multiterrain runs. They’re designed to let you run off-road—just not too far off the beaten track and certainly not onto the trickiest mountain slopes. The big selling point: They’re versatile enough to cruise compacted gravel (of course), forest tracks, hard-packed park and river paths, light uneven trails, and even the road commute to get there. “Gravel is a fairly new category,” says Taylor Bodin, chief trail shoe tester for Believe in the Run . “It is meant to be versatile in the sense that it can traverse lighter terrain more efficiently. This could mean anything from a door-to-trail shoe to a light trail shoe.” Gravel shoes blend the technologies and design of road and trail, mixing some of the cushion, impact pr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-gravel-running-shoes/", "timestamp": 1765172140.866045}

Players walk clockwise in a circle. When the music stops, everyone sits in a chair. Big Tech is setting in motion its plans for the next gen of lead designers, engineers, AI chiefs, and even CEOs. In Cupertino, Apple execs with familiar faces are retiring or reducing responsibilities. Who’s in and who’s out? Well, chief operating officer Jeff Williams retired in November, and the speculation is that CEO Tim Cook could follow in the near term. Lisa Jackson, who has led Apple’s sustainability efforts since 2013, is now set to retire in January too. There’s also the squad of Apple staffers who have been lured away to work with OpenAI , notably Apple’s former chief design officer Jony Ive after his independent stint at LoveFrom . In 2024, Molly Anderson was named industrial design leader, heading up a team of mostly fresh faces. Others have gone to Meta, such as Apple’s VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, who just this week was poached to head up a new Reality Labs design studio. At Apple, he’s been replaced by long-time UI designer Stephen Lemay. Phew. In this swirl of shifting talent, John Ternus, who has worked for Apple since 2001, and served as SVP of hardware engineering for the last four years, reporting directly to Tim Cook, is emerging as the frontrunner to succeed Cook as Apple CEO, reportedly as soon as next year. WIRED asked Apple for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. Alongside a steady drip of “leaks” on succession planning and Ternus’ position at the front of the pack, since 2023, Ternus has been given more prominence at product launch events. He announced the iPhone Air onstage this past September, and has appeared alongside other senior Apple leaders in press interviews and in-store Apple events. “I think they're testing to see what sentiment is like.

Here’s a test for infants: Show them a glass of water on a desk. Hide it behind a wooden board. Now move the board toward the glass. If the board keeps going past the glass, as if it weren’t there, are they surprised? Many 6-month-olds are, and by a year, almost all children have an intuitive notion of an object’s permanence, learned through observation. Now some artificial intelligence models do too. Researchers have developed an AI system that learns about the world via videos and demonstrates a notion of “surprise” when presented with information that goes against the knowledge it has gleaned. The model, created by Meta and called Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), does not make any assumptions about the physics of the world contained in the videos. Nonetheless, it can begin to make sense of how the world works. “Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting,” says Micha Heilbron , a cognitive scientist at the University of Amsterdam who studies how brains and artificial systems make sense of the world. As the engineers who build self-driving cars know, it can be hard to get an AI system to reliably make sense of what it sees. Most systems designed to “understand” videos in order to either classify their content (“a person playing tennis,” for example) or identify the contours of an object—say, a car up ahead—work in what’s called “pixel space.” The model essentially treats every pixel in a video as equal in importance. But these pixel-space models come with limitations. Imagine trying to make sense of a suburban street. If the scene has cars, traffic lights and trees, the model might focus too much on irrelevant details such as the motion of the leaves. It might miss the color of the traffic light, or the positions of nearby cars. “When you go to images or video, you don’t want to work in [pixel] space because there are too many details you d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-one-ai-model-creates-a-physical-intuition-of-its-environment/", "timestamp": 1765172141.6767747}

Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider ) had \"Norwegian kaiju\" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating \"Megatroll\" it has locked away.

If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I’d recommend picking something a little lower maintenance. I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand. Lenovo Go Gen 2 Rating: 7/10 Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings.

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain . By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity . The present crisis reflects not only this summer’s extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry. The drought quickly disrupted Tehran’s urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank . Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation , and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved . These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran’s infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress. These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer. Over the past five years, precipitation during this wet period has remained consistently below the long-term climatological baseline, with the 2024-25 season showing the most pronounce", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/why-tehran-is-running-out-of-water-iran-climate-change-drought-extreme-weather/", "timestamp": 1765172143.3902194}

Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept —a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell. British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing. Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new . Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn’t until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings. Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet Rating: 9/10 RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila! The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company’s name, RLS, or “Relea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/canyon-deflectr-rls-bike-helmet/", "timestamp": 1765172144.1576712}

The second-lowest is a mandatory gift for someone you don’t know well or care for very much, such as the wedding of a distant cousin or former nemesis. The third tier is a gift for someone you know and like, and the fourth is a treat yo’ self gift you bestow upon yourself after finishing a large project, landing a promotion at work, or finally turning a profit at your bespoke AI-powered marketing and SEO agency. Gevi’s imaginatively named Espresso Machine lands at the high end of the second tier. This single-boiler, 15-bar machine performs essential functions like grinding coffee, pulling shots, and steaming milk at a level that’s acceptable for its cost.

Valve had already banned an early, incomplete version of the game two years ago and offered, according to Santa Ragione , little clarification about why at the time. Then, hours before the game’s release, the Epic Games Store banned Horses as well. A day after the game’s launch, distribution platform Humble removed, and then later relisted, the title. The public swiftly spoke out against these bans, and community support for the game’s developers has been plentiful. Many pieces have been written online about how the game doesn’t deserve to be shunned by the distribution platforms, and about how the game’s content is relatively tame . But too few of these pieces engage with the content of the game on a critical level. Horses ’ storytelling is clumsy, and its blasé treatment of the sexual assaults (plural!) depicted in the game fails to elevate the game beyond more than a lazy commentary of sexual repression. It’s difficult to untangle the circumstances and controversy surrounding the game’s release from the content of the game itself. As a writer, I think censorship of creative work is Bad. I think Horses has as much right to exist as any other game, and that the power of distribution platforms to ban and delist a game by a small studio should be a concern for everyone. But the real problem with Horses is not that it’s too audacious for what is clearly intended to be an adult audience. Horses , for all the attention around its banning, is tedious and overreliant on pseudo-intellectual ideas. It confuses its own pretension for something profound.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm. But because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you. That’s where Womanizer coupons come into play—because no one should have to decide on just one of their fantastic sex toys. Cyber week has started at Womanizer. Time to get your groove on, for less.

The outside general counsel for USIP, he’s been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump’s right to remove them from office.

Though he cut his product-management teeth at Google and Stripe , he was never comfortable with the industry’s increasing prioritization of profits over people. Once during his time at Google, he extolled the societal benefits of a project only to be met with, “Oh Alex, you'd be a VP by now if you just stopped thinking through the implications of your actions.” Since that 2010s episode, the revenues and valuations in tech have skyrocketed, as has the blithe disregard for users. “It’s disgusting to see the industry as it currently is,” Komoroske says. Now, he’s doing something about it. Today, Komoroske and a loose group of concerned technologists are releasing The Resonant Computing Manifesto , an idealistic set of principles that attempts to recenter Silicon Valley around the values that have been lost in the scramble to hyperscale and maximize shareholder value. Komoroske and his coauthors are inviting anyone who, um, resonates with this jeremiad to sign it and proselytize those values in the products they create. Accompanying the manifesto is a shared doc of “the theses of resonant computing” where the community itself can provide input on shared principles. (Think: Martin Luther with a Google Workspace account.) “There are a lot of us who remember a Silicon Valley, a world of innovation, where we felt good,” Techdirt founder Mike Masnick, a coauthor of the manifesto, said during WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday during a panel announcing the manifesto. “A lot of us have noticed that we don’t get that feeling anymore.” Komoroske followed that up by saying that the manifesto is a response to cynicism, and that the values in it are ideals people in the Valley want to follow, even if it may not seem so on the surface. The idea for the manifesto emerged from an informal “think tank,” as Komoroske calls it, of technologists concerned about the state of Silicon Valley.

Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs. In a post on the Meta platform Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the two would lead the new studio and “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” In his own Instagram post, Sorrentino confirmed the news . (In response to a request for comment from WIRED, a Meta rep pointed toward the Threads posts by Zuckerberg and Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth .) Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface. If they want users to stay on their platform, they’re going to have to fix the UI.” The move comes as Meta continues to go absolutely all in on its AI efforts.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

Lavingia joined the IRS in November. In a conversation at WIRED’s Big Interview event with former acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration Leland Dudek and David Foote, outside counsel for the US Institute of Peace, Lavingia said, “I'm working at IRS for online accounts.” Lavingia said that he joined as a career employee after Sam Corcos, a DOGE operative and the chief information officer of the Treasury Department, reached out to him after reading an article he'd written about his experience in government, offering to put him in touch with people who could help him find a role in which he could put his talents to use as a federal worker. When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should. Lavingia was previously assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), where he was part of a group of technologists brought into the government in the early months of DOGE’s takeover. In 2015, he had applied to be a part of the US Digital Service (USDS), now the US DOGE Service . Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work. At the VA, Lavignia attempted to use an AI tool to write code for the agency’s systems and suggested the agency move away from paper forms entirely. He built a tool to “munch” data about the agency’s contracts to identify those that could be cut. He was fired from his role at the VA in May after he spoke to a reporter about his work at DOGE.

The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday. The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command’s classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.” The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate , because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security .

But It Might Not Work", "summary": "By rolling back auto industry fuel efficiency goals, US president Donald Trump hopes to make new cars cheaper. But prices won’t drop for years, and consumers will spend more on gas in the meantime.", "content": "The Trump administration says its proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, announced officially in the Oval Office on Wednesday, is an attempt to shave dollars off the ballooning cost of new cars in the US. But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change. The Biden administration took a carrot-and-stick approach to vehicles and their effect on the environment. Light-duty cars and trucks alone are responsible for some 15 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The previous administration tried to boost electric vehicle adoption by using tax subsidies for consumers and manufacturers interested in building fuel-efficient vehicles and technologies, including batteries. It also introduced penalties for those unable or unwilling to meet stricter environmental standards. Automakers should be able to hit next decade’s goals by selling more electric vehicles, the government then reasoned.

That’s when women are supposed to start getting mammograms and men are supposed to start paying a bit more attention to their prostates. Over the next decade, you’ll start getting colonoscopies, and from then on out, it feels like a gradual march of doctor’s appointments and tests until your body collapses sometime in your seventies or eighties. But what if modern medicine has the timeline all wrong? What if we’re testing some middle-aged people unnecessarily for diseases they’ll most likely never get, while blindly ignoring twentysomethings who might be prone to colon cancer? Is there a way that, even as we age, we can stay healthy in a way that’s both meaningful and not reliant on taking 12 horse-sized pills every morning? Eric Topol certainly thinks so. The cardiologist, vice president of Scripps Research, and author of Super Agers is convinced that new innovations in AI-assisted medicine, bioengineering, and anti-inflammatory awareness could have potential to revolutionize the way people age. During WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday, Topol told features editor Sandra Upson that while he was working on Super Agers he learned that there’s a difference between lifespan and health span and that neither has much to do with genetics. Someone who’s “wellderly,” or over 65 and generally healthy, has pretty much the same genetic makeup as someone who’s elderly and facing major health challenges, like heart disease, cancer, or a neurodegenerative disorder. Instead, Topol said, there appears to be a correlation between having a healthy immune system and aging healthily. Lifestyle can influence how healthy you are, too, with Topol advocating for eating a diet low in ultra-processed foods, focusing on sleep quality over sleep quantity, and getting out in nature.

The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically.

We have to make the risks manageable. And that's why we talk about it so much.” More than 300,000 startups, developers, and companies use some version of Anthropic’s Claude model and Amodei said that, through the company’s dealings with those brands, she’s learned that, while customers want their AI to be able to do great things, they also want it to be reliable and safe. “No one says, ‘We want a less safe product,’” Amodei said, likening Anthropic’s reporting of its model’s limits and jailbreaks to that of a car company releasing crash-test studies to show how it has addressed safety concerns. It might seem shocking to see a crash-test dummy flying through a car window in a video, but learning that an automaker updated their vehicle’s safety features as a result of that test could sell a buyer on a car. Amodei said the same goes for companies using Anthropic’s AI products, making for a market that is somewhat self-regulating. “We’re setting what you can almost think of as minimum safety standards just by what we’re putting into the economy,” she said.

Chu . At WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco, the onetime YouTuber and Crazy Rich Asians director said that working with acts like Justin Bieber taught him the value of connecting with fans online during the creation process. While directing Bieber’s concert film, Never Say Never , in the late aughts, Chu said the then-14-year-old star used Twitter to introduce Chu to fans. After Bieber posted a clip joking that the director was following him around on set, Chu told WIRED’s senior culture editor, Manisha Krishnan, he began to watch his online followers grow by tens of thousands of people almost instantly, something that really drove home the power of direct connection with a fan base. Working with Bieber, Chu said, made him realize that “the story is being told before you even start shooting, and after you’re done with the movie, you have to continue that story.” That’s why he believes fans have felt so invested in Wicked —and its sequel, Wicked: For Good —and why the movie’s marketing and press tours have leaned so heavily on the relationships built by the cast while filming. Bonds, like the one between stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, came from the immense pressure the crew felt to make something not only great but also bankable. “We only had each other, so we’re very, very bonded,” Chu said, likening the relationship to that of Silicon Valley developers working long hours together to deliver a new product. A Bay Area native, Chu said he has always felt partially indebted to the tech world for his start in entertainment. In the ’90s, when Chu was just a teenager, tech-minded customers at his parents’ Chinese restaurant would slip him computers, video cards, and software when they heard he was interested in filmmaking, giving him a leg up on fellow students when he went to college at the University of Southern California. “I was built by the gen", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-jon-chu-wicked/", "timestamp": 1765172157.2742255}

Cole, 30, is charged with transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, intimidate, or destroy property and with attempting to damage and destroy the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees by means of an explosive device. If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison. According to an affidavit , investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Cole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day. Senior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it. “Though it had been nearly five ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/", "timestamp": 1765172157.9037688}

When asked at WIRED’s Big Interview event if AI is a bubble, the company’s CEO said, “Emphatically, from my perspective, no.”", "content": "Earlier this year, WIRED said that AMD CEO Lisa Su was “ out for Nvidia’s blood .” The American chipmaker is still small compared to the juggernaut that is Nvidia—their market caps are $353 billion and $4.4 trillion, respectively—but Su’s company is gaining steam. Today, when Su took the stage at WIRED’s Big Interview conference in San Francisco, she had something else in her sights: the AI bubble . When asked by WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode if the tech industry is in an AI bubble, her response was “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” The AI industry is going to need scores of chips from companies like AMD, and fears of such a bubble, Su said, are “somewhat overstated.” That might sound bold, but boldness is Su’s whole deal. Since she became AMD’s CEO in 2014, she has increased the company’s market cap from $2 billion to $300 billion. Now, Su is betting big on the need for much more computing power for AI, and the data centers needed to provide that. Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead for AMD. One is all of those data centers being built, and another is getting its chips out into the hands of as many customers as possible. During the discussion, Goode asked the AMD CEO about selling chips to China. She confirmed that AMD will pay a 15 percent tax instituted by the Trump administration on MI308 chips it plans to resume shipping to China. The US government previously halted sales of the chips to China, but then began reviewing applications again over the summer. AMD said earlier this year that US export restrictions on the MI308 chips would cost the company roughly $800 million. Earlier this year, AMD made a huge deal with OpenAI, under which the AI company will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct GPUs over the course of several years. As part of the deal, AMD agreed to allow OpenAI to buy 160 million shares of the company’s stock for a penny per share. effectively giving it a 10 percent stake in the company.

Now he wants to sell you phone service—without knowing almost anything about you.", "content": "Nicholas Merrill has spent his career fighting government surveillance . But he would really rather you didn’t call what he’s selling now a “burner phone.” Yes, he dreams of a future where anyone in the US can get a working smartphone—complete with cellular coverage and data—without revealing their identity, even to the phone company. But to call such anonymous phones “burners” suggests that they’re for something illegal, shady, or at least subversive. The term calls to mind drug dealers or deep-throat confidential sources in parking garages. With his new startup, Merrill says he instead wants to offer cellular service for your existing phone that makes near-total mobile privacy the permanent, boring default of daily life in the US. “We're not looking to cater to people doing bad things,” says Merrill. “We're trying to help people feel more comfortable living their normal lives, where they're not doing anything wrong, and not feel watched and exploited by giant surveillance and data mining operations. I think it’s not controversial to say the vast majority of people want that.” That’s the thinking behind Phreeli, the phone carrier startup Merrill launched today, designed to be the most privacy-focused cellular provider available to Americans. Phreeli, as in, “speak freely,” aims to give its user a different sort of privacy from the kind that can be had with end-to-end encrypted texting and calling tools like Signal or WhatsApp . Those apps hide the content of conversations, or even, in Signal’s case, metadata like the identities of who is talking to whom. Phreeli instead wants to offer actual anonymity. It can’t help government agencies or data brokers obtain users’ identifying information because it has almost none to share. The only piece of information the company records about its users when they sign up for a Phreeli phone number is, in fact, a mere ZIP code. That’s the minimum personal data Merrill has determined his company is legally required to keep about i", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/new-anonymous-phone-carrier-sign-up-with-nothing-but-a-zip-code/", "timestamp": 1765172158.7724235}

DeepSeek and ByteDance, the two leaders of China’s AI industry , are adopting vastly different strategies. On Monday, DeepSeek released DeepSeek V3.2, another open-weight model that anyone can tinker with. The startup says it performs on par with the latest models from OpenAI and Google, and it even beats them on some key mathematics benchmarks. That same day, ByteDance, whose dominance in AI applications we covered previously, introduced even more ways for people to use its chatbot, Doubao. ByteDance is now working with a Chinese smartphone manufacturer to embed Doubao into the operating system, giving it access to different apps and allowing it to conduct agentic tasks with them. In other words, it’s coming for Apple’s Siri. Both ByteDance and DeepSeek have AI apps with over 140 million monthly users. But their latest announcements represent two diverging trends in China’s AI industry. While some companies are still competing with their Western counterparts to build ever more capable models, others have quietly withdrawn from that game and are focusing on how they can integrate their AI tools into people’s everyday lives. DeepSeek’s latest open-weight model may have disappointed some of its most loyal followers, who are still waiting for R2, a much-anticipated update to the initial model that rocked Silicon Valley in January. Instead, DeepSeek released V3.2 and V3.2-Speciale, which are better-optimized versions of its previous model V3.2-Exp, released in September. Still, V3.2 caused a stir in the AI industry because DeepSeek claims it can solve the type of advanced math questions asked at the International Mathematical Olympiad, and its performance on other coding and reasoning tasks is supposedly on par with or above GPT 5 and Gemini 3. “It suddenly dawned on me why they call the company DeepSeek with the whale as a motif.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating. But remaining businesses (Value Retail + Ethnic + D2C + Luxury) will need investments in the near term.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

This recent high-profile jewellery theft and the accidental water leak raise concerns over the museum’s infrastructure.", "content": "Paris' Louvre Museum is once again in the spotlight after the authorities recently announced that several hundred works from the Egyptian department were damaged due to a water leak late in November. The incident reportedly occurred on 26 November, almost a month after a daring jewellery heist in which Napoleonic jewellery worth $102 million was stolen in broad daylight. The museum’s deputy general manager, Francis Steinbock, elaborated on the extent of damage and informed that periodicals and archaeological reviews dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were damaged. As per The Guardian report, the water leak damaged between 300 and 400 works. Egyptologists and students regularly consulted these treasured works. Even though the damaged items were “extremely useful”, they were not “unique”, said Steinbock. Suggesting that the losses in these collections are not significant, Steinbock added, “At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.” “No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" The Guardian quoted the deputy administrator as saying. According to a Bloomberg report, the world's most visited museum suffered a leak from a water pipe that damaged treasured items kept in its library on Egyptian antiquities. In the Mollien wing, a valve from an obsolete heating and ventilation system accidentally opened, which caused water to seep through the ceiling. The system was shut off for several months and was due to be replaced in September 2026. Francis Steinbock said that restoration of damaged works is in progress, which will “be dried, sent to a bookbinder to be restored, and then returned to the shelves.” The concerned authorities launched an internal investigation into the leak. Notably, four suspects have been charged in the October jewel robbery, but the whereabouts of the precious jewellery— including royal necklaces, tiaras and earrings — are still unknown.

The flare-up threatens to undermine months of diplomatic effort, including a high-profile agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The Thai Army spokesman Major General Winthai Suvaree said the strikes followed what Bangkok characterised as repeated Cambodian violations of the ceasefire in recent days. “Both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement,” he confirmed, noting that they deployed aircraft in response to what commanders considered “clear and immediate threats” along the border. Bangkok Post quoted the Thai Army stating that Cambodian troops opened fire in the Phu Pha Lek-Phlan Hin Paet Kon area at 2.15 pm. Two Thai soldiers were hit, prompting Thai forces to return fire. Cambodian troops later fired recoilless rifles, the statement said. Phnom Penh has issued its own accusations, alleging that Thai troops crossed into Cambodian territory and initiated hostilities first. Independent verification remains limited, and neither side has disclosed casualty figures. The Thailand-Cambodia border dispute erupted into a five-day war in July, centred on long-contested areas where overlapping historical claims have fuelled tensions for decades. The July fighting displaced civilians, stalled cross-border trade, and prompted urgent international mediation. A ceasefire agreement was subsequently brokered by President Trump and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, with Trump later witnessing the signing of an expanded deal in Kuala Lumpur in October. The accord was billed as a framework for long-term stabilisation and demilitarisation—terms now under strain following the renewed hostilities.

ICE agents cannot enter spaces like a home, school or private area of a workplace without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, Mamdani said.  \"ICE is legally allowed to lie to you, but you have the right to remain silent. If you're being detained, you may always ask, Am I free to go?' repeatedly until they answer you,\" said Mamdani, who will be sworn in as mayor on Jan 1. His comments came a week after demonstrators gathered as ICE attempted to detain people on Canal Street near New York's Chinatown. A similar immigration sweep in the same neighbourhood last October was also met with protests. \"New York will always welcome immigrants, and I will fight each and every day to protect, support, and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters,\" Mamdani said in Sunday's video.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: The government's move to upgrade its digital farm marketplace, meant to give farmers access to more markets and better prices, has run into implementation glitches, with Rajasthan reporting data mismatches, login issues, and stalled mandi operations. The old electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) system was shut down even before onboarding to the revamped version was complete, forcing farmers back to local physical mandis, where fewer buyers mean reduced competition and lower price realisations, two people directly involved in the transition process told Mint on the condition of anonymity. The disruption could not have come at a worse time, as kharif crop arrivals start to surge. “Any disruption during the transition is therefore seen as significant, especially during the peak arrival season of kharif crops. When e-NAM is not working and farmers have to sell their produce in the physical mandi, they lose access to competitive bidding from multiple mandis, and must rely only on the traders present locally on that day, which reduces competition and can lead to lower prices,\" said the first of the two persons cited earlier, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. e-NAM is one of the central government's flagship digital reforms for agriculture, connecting about 18 million farmers through 1,522 mandis onboarded on the platform, out of the nearly 7,500 regulated mandis across the country. The platform aims to improve price discovery, reduce cartelization, and allow farmers to sell beyond their local mandis, helping them secure better returns and increase their income. In response to Mint 's queries, the agriculture ministry said that several suggestions and issues had been reported after the pilot launch in Rajasthan, and that its team is working to incorporate feedback and resolve problems.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff met with David Barnea — the head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency — and a senior Qatari official. Witkoff hosted the meeting, said the White House official, who spoke on anonymity. The talks comes as the Trump administration attempts to coax its regional allies such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia to establish formal diplomatic relations with Israel. Such a coalition would help advance Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, but Israel’s strike in Qatar and military operations in Gaza have hindered the efforts. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Saturday the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are going through “a critical moment.” There’s “a lot of uncertainty” over Middle East stability as deadly Israeli strikes continue to shake fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon and Iran’s standoff with the US remains unaddressed, he also told the Doha Forum on Sunday. Sunday’s meeting in New York was first reported by Axios. Israel’s strike on Doha, Qatar’s capital, was aimed at leaders of Hamas, the Palestinian terror group that attacked Israel in October 2023 — triggering the war in Gaza. The Doha attack prompted rare criticism of Israeli leaders by the White House and unnerved Gulf neighbors of Qatar, which hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Here's how it works.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "The Unique Identification Authority of India ( UIDAI ) has approved a new rule that will require entities like hotels and event organisers to register with the authority if they want to use Aadhaar to verify the identities of customers, a senior government official said. This move aims to discourage places from taking photocopies of Aadhaar cards of customers and storing them in physical form, as these can be misused. Such practices are also in contravention of the present Aadhaar Act. UIDAI CEO Bhuvnesh Kumar told PTI that the new rule will give these entities access to a new technology that will allow them to verify individuals by scanning a QR code or by connecting with the new Aadhaar app, which is currently under development. “The new rule has been approved by the authority and will be notified soon. It will mandate registration of offline verification-seeking entities like hotels, event organisers. The objective is to discourage paper-based Aadhaar verification,” Kumar said. This latest verification system will also help in avoiding delays caused by outages in the intermediate servers that connect to the central Aadhaar database, ensuring the smoother processing of various services. However, for entities that prefer offline verification, the authority will give them access to an API (application programming interface) through which they can update their system for Aadhaar verification, PTI reported. UIDAI is beta-testing a new app that will enable app-to-app verification without requiring to connect with the central Aadhaar database server for every verification request. Access to the new app won't be limited to a few entities, as it can also be used by airports, shops that need to sell age-appropriate products, and other places that require Aadhaar-based verification. “The ease of verification will enhance offline verification without the use of paper while maintaining privacy of users or any risk of their Aadhaar data getting leaked for misuse,” Kumar told P", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/uidai-makes-registration-mandatory-for-entities-seeking-aadhaar-based-verification-to-curb-misuse-details-here-11765126194929.html", "timestamp": 1765172237.1212451}

The leak — discovered on 26 November — was caused by the accidental opening of a valve in the heating and ventilation system, which caused water to seep through the ceiling of the library area in the Mollien wing. According to the Louvre ’s deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, the affected material includes “Egyptology journals” and “scientific documentation” used by researchers — mostly books and archival items dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The museum said that while the documents are “extremely useful,” they are “by no means unique.” Importantly, no unique heritage artefacts or irreplaceable objects were damaged, and the institution believes there are currently no irreparable losses to the collection. The Louvre has launched an internal investigation to determine exactly how the malfunction occurred. It acknowledged that the heating system responsible for the leak is “completely obsolete,” had been shut down for several months, and was scheduled to be replaced beginning September 2026 under broader renovation plans. As part of the damage control, the affected works will be carefully dried and treated, then sent to bookbinders for restoration before being returned to the shelves. Steinbock described the incident as “extremely regrettable,” and the museum said it will reinforce safety protocols to prevent any recurrence.

Soon after she and husband Michael Dell released a video announcing the historic pledge, social media lit up with memes and comments, with many users fixating on the noticeable changes on her face as they asked “what happened?” The video sparked a global frenzy the moment it was released. But instead of focusing on her massive donation, the attention shifted to her appearance, with social media debating whether the changes were due to Botox or plastic surgery . The internet has also dug up some of her old photos to compare them with the new pictures to point out the difference, overshadowing her philanthropic achievements. In the older images, her complexion appeared darker, features were softer and more natural, while the new video showed noticeably sharper features and wider eyes, and a comparitevely whiter skin tone. The contrast fueled online speculation about possible cosmetic enhancements, though nothing has been confirmed. This has never been confirmed by either Susan Dell or anyone close to her. But, Irish Star US spoke with some medical professionals to understand the visible changes on Susan Dell's face.

Air Transat pilots could begin the strike as early as 3:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, December 10, Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said in a statement. The Canadian leisure carrier called the strike notice “premature” given the progress at the bargaining table and said it had proposed compromises, including a 59% salary increase over five years and improvements to working conditions. \"There is still time to avoid a strike but unless significant progress is made at the bargaining table, we will strike if that's what it takes to achieve a modern contract,\" said Bradley Small, chair of the Air Transat Master Executive Council. Air Transat is working with the union to reach a deal and avoid a walkout, but will fully halt operations by December 9 to prevent passengers and crews from being stranded, Transat AT said.

However, he missed several deadlines, and his announcement on Sunday came days ahead of his latest latest extended deadline of 15 December.", "content": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said that he sold his soybean farm last week, something that he was required to do under an ethics agreement when he took office. While appearing for CBS' 'Face the Nation' programme on Sunday, Bessent spoke about the agricultural sector, including his own experiences running a soybean farm. “I'm involved in the agriculture industry… I run a soybean farm,” the US Treasury Secretary said, in reply to which he was asked, “You own it, or invest in it?” “People in my family go out and work on it,” was Bessent's response. “I actually divested it this week as part of my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business but I probably know more about it than any Treasury Secretary,” he explained, clarifying his role in the operations of the farm. The New York Times , in August this year, had reported that Bessent, whose net worth is estimated at more than $500 million, owned corn and soybean farmland in North Dakota worth as much as $25 million. The US Treasury secretary also earned up to $1 million in annual rental income from the farms, NYT reported. As part of his ethics agreement while taking office, Bessent was required to divest his assets, including the farmland. However, the Treasury Secretary missed several deadlines to adhere to the requirements of the US Office of Government Ethics (OGE), and his announcement on Sunday came days ahead of his latest latest extended deadline, which was reported to be 15 December. Bessent's comments also come amid China agreeing to restart soybean purchases from the US after months of halting the same. The breakthrough came in October following US President Donald Trump's meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping, with China committing at least 12 million metric tonnes worth of soybean purchases for the season. Bessent said that while China was honouring its agreement, US farmers would still need short-term bailout till there was more certainty about Beijing's commitment—\"I can tell you that wha", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/scott-bessent-divests-soybean-farm-as-part-of-ethics-agreement-how-much-did-us-treasury-secretary-earn-from-agriculture-11765134912877.html", "timestamp": 1765172239.4651577}

The statement came from the Israeli military, with army chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir making the announcement. \"We have operational control over extensive parts of the Gaza Strip and we will remain on those defence lines. The Yellow Line is a new border line -- serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity,\" Zamir said, as per news agency AFP . Under the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) were required to withdraw to positions behind the Yellow Line. The area east of the Yellow Line, controlled by Israel, accounts for 53-58% of the area of the Gaza Strip. It should be noted that the status of the Yellow Line is officially temporary, serving as a de facto military border inside Gaza. Later phases of the peace plan envision further Israeli withdrawals and the eventual deployment of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). By the second withdrawal (and the deployment of the ISF), Israel's share of territory in Gaza is expected to be reduced to 40%, before a further reduction to 15% by the third withdrawal. Zamir's statement on Sunday comes shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signalled a move towards the second phase of the ceasefire. During a news conference with visiting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Netanyahu said that Tel Aviv and Hamas were \"very shortly expected to move into the second phase of the ceasefire\", adding that such a move would only take place after the Palestinian militant group returned the remains of the last Israeli hostage. Hamas has yet to handover the remains of 24-year-old Ran Gvili, a police officer who was killed during the 7 October attack of 2023.

Eyewitnesses who survived the tragedy told news agency PTI earlier on Sunday that a pyro gun fireworks, which were set off as dancers started performing, were behind the deadly blaze.

A tourist who survived the tragedy claimed that fireworks were set off when dancers were performing, and it was the likely cause, PTI reported. Most of the deaths resulted from suffocation, as many victims, including employees, became trapped on the ground floor of ` Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Arpora, 25 km from Panaji, a fire official told the news portal.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success. Naturally, studying abroad improves language skills —especially if you’re living in a country where a different language is spoken", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/what-skills-do-you-gain-from-studying-abroad/", "timestamp": 1765172271.1884198}
