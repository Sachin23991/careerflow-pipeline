Responding to a question by MP Anupriya Patel, the ministry shared the details in a written reply, stating that 74 medical colleges were approved in AY 2024–25 and 44 in AY 2025–26, based on National Medical Commission (NMC) approvals. The reply also included the state-wise distribution of these colleges. Uttar Pradesh saw the highest number of new colleges across the two years, followed by Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The reply further stated that the expansion of medical infrastructure is part of the government’s ongoing effort to increase the availability of medical education and healthcare services. (Source: Rajya Sabha UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 268, Answered on December 2, 2025) In a separate written reply, Union Health Minister J P Nadda informed the House that India’s doctor-population ratio is currently estimated at 1:811, assuming that 80 per cent of registered practitioners in both allopathic and AYUSH systems are available. India has 13,88,185 registered allopathic doctors and 7,51,768 AYUSH practitioners. Nadda added that the number of medical colleges has risen from 387 to 818 since 2014, while UG seats have increased from 51,348 to 1,28,875 and PG seats from 31,185 to 82,059.

The move came after a marginal improvement in Delhi’s air quality, though the AQI has continued to oscillate between the “poor” and “very poor” categories. Parents and students said the reopening has brought back routine but not relief. Many expressed unease about children commuting and sitting in classrooms amid what they describe as “visible pollution”. “The AQI may have improved on paper, but the air still smells toxic. My son starts coughing the moment he steps out. I’m not fully convinced schools should have reopened so quickly,” said Mamta Agrawal, a parent from Noida. Others felt academic continuity needed priority. “Children can’t keep shifting between online and offline modes. My daughter’s focus breaks every time this happens,” said Yogendra Yadav, a parent from East Delhi . Teachers voiced concerns about classroom ventilation and preparedness. “Not all schools have air purifiers, and younger students often either forget masks or are not comfortable using them. We worry about prolonged exposure,” said Sumit Sharma, a government school teacher in North Delhi. “It’s definitely challenging for us as teachers. Online classes demand that we constantly work to keep students focused on a screen, and that itself is tiring. Now that offline classes are resuming, we have to divide our attention between students sitting in front of us and those who may still be joining remotely. Managing both formats together affects the pace of teaching, and it becomes difficult to ensure every child is engaged and learning equally,” said the Delhi government school teacher. A working mother from Delhi, Ginni Bhandari, echoed the sentiment. “I was sending my daughter (who is in Class 5) to school because being a working parent, it was difficult for me to handle everything.

The restriction on recruitment under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Reservation of Seats in Education Institutions and Appointments of Posts and Services under the State) Act, 2022, will remain until further orders. However, the HC bench allowed the government to continue recruitment processes already notified before November 19, 2025, even if they follow the increased reservation percentages. The court also clarified that all appointments made through these ongoing recruitments will be subject to the final outcome of the petitions challenging the law. The division bench of Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C M Poonacha issued the interim order on November 27 while hearing two PILs filed by Mahendra Kumar Mitra of Raichur and Mahesh of Bengaluru . The petitions question the constitutional validity of the 2022 Act, particularly the hike in SC/ST reservation, from 15 per cent to 17 per cent for SCs and from 3 per cent to 7 per cent for STs. Other Backward Classes (OBCs) reservation continues to remain at 32 per cent, which takes over all reservations in the state to 56 per cent. The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh.

This is the time when most students are juggling multiple demands—revision, full-length syllabus coverage, coaching classes, test series, and the pressure to meet their own expectations. As the exam inches closer, it is natural to experience stress and a sense of urgency to perform well. Amidst all this, aspirants often look for methods that can make their preparation more effective, structured, and result-oriented. Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test. But simply taking a mock test is not enough. The real value lies in taking each mock seriously, approaching it with exam-like discipline, analysing the results with patience and depth, and learning something meaningful from every attempt.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) .

INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

RRB Group D Admit Card 2025 (Out) The RRB Group D application and modification phases were completed in early 2025 without any disruption. In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts. The ruling lifted all legal barriers and gave RRBs a clear path to conduct the exam.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual. But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead. Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic. (1/2) Today we’re starting to test a new way to seamlessly go deeper in AI Mode directly from the Search results page on mobile, globally. This brings us closer to our vision for Search: just ask whatever’s on your mind – no matter how long or complex – and find exactly what you… pic.twitter.com/mcCS7oT2FI With the new test, announced on Monday, Google says users will be able to “seamlessly go deeper” in AI Mode directly from the Search results page.

Each of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now. Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time. Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.” As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently. “You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday. “It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said. Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention.

He wasn’t joking . This time, we’ve got Nicholas Kelez , a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make.

Bryan Johnson — who made his millions selling his finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He publicly documents each step of his process on social media, including getting plasma transfusions from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and injecting Botox into his genitals.

The rollout of the new Android 16 features, which are first coming to Pixel devices, marks a new chapter in how Android updates are delivered, as the company is moving from a single yearly update to more frequent releases. Android 16 is adding AI-powered notification summaries that condense long messages and group chats into quick, glanceable overviews. A new “Notification organizer” will automatically group and silence lower-priority notifications, such as promotions, news, and social alerts. The update also brings more ways to customize devices, with users getting access to custom icon shapes, themed icons, and the option to automatically darken light apps, even those that don’t have their own native dark theme. Additionally, there’s a new Parental Controls option within Android Settings that allows parents to set screen time limits, create downtime schedules, control app usage, and more for their children. These updates are starting to roll out with Android 16 on eligible Pixel devices starting Tuesday. Google is also releasing several new Android features that aren’t specific to Android 16. A new beta feature called “Call Reason” allows users to flag calls to saved contacts as “urgent.” Recipients will see this on their incoming call screen and know it’s time-sensitive. If they miss the call, the “urgent” note will stay in their call history. Google is also launching “Expressive Captions” that display the full emotion of speech with tags like [sad] or [joyful], whether it’s a video message or a post on social media.

Players with a Netflix subscription can now download the game, which features mobile-friendly controls, including touch-screen shooting and navigation. It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available. Originally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.  The inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has faced challenges in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when estimates revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year. Red Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise. The launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of games on smart TVs in October.

According to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia , ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday. However, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%. The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session. Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year. In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app. Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase.

The first version of AWS Nova was announced last year at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service. “The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.” The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding. Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images.

Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected. The post, which was reshared and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product.

The initial rollout of these features is in partnership with the popular video game Marvel Rivals, which now has a dedicated store page within the game’s official Discord server. Marvel Rivals is a smart choice for this launch, as it garnered 10 million players within 72 hours of its release last year, generated over $100 million in its first month, and has built a community of more than 4 million members on Discord. Players can now browse and purchase in-game items directly from the Marvel Rivals server, which includes items such as bundles, costumes, emotes, and emojis. Additionally, users can create wishlists that friends can view and purchase as gifts.

While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time. Agentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps.

It just released its third version, known as Trainium3, with some impressive specs.", "content": "Amazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs. The cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS. AWS says the system is more than 4x faster, with 4x more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10x the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more. It is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscious way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too. AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said. AWS also presented a bit of a roadmap for the next chip, Trainium4, which is already in development.

If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes. The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to autom", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/", "timestamp": 1764718240.975943}

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat.

Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change.

These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now.

Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room.

This one offered by Amazon , for example, is a Gorilla Tag bundle, which is currently the most popular game on the platform. It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played.

Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR. Meanwhile, Best Buy is offering a bundle with the game The Walking Dead: Sinners & Saints for the same price of $249. That's a $20 game. But it also comes with a $50 Best Buy e-gift card.

Meta Walmart Best Buy (Walking Dead Bundle) Amazon Meta The Meta Quest 3S is the best VR headset to buy, and it has been ever since its release in late 2024.

This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth.

Flock has become a pervasive technology in the US, with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use every day to investigate things like carjackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically.

Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by.

It's otherwise expected to be a processor bump, so don't expect much else. If you just want a simple, big-screen tablet to catch up on shows, do some work, and even play games, the iPad A16 fits the bill. It's powerful enough for most apps and games, and the 11-inch screen size is not too big and not too small. This iPad recently got a whole lot more versatile with the iPadOS 26 update , which adds windowing features, turning the iPad experience into a Mac. You can resize windows, flick them to the sides for split-screen, and iPadOS 26.1 brings back Slide Over, so you still have some options on how you want to multitask. Connect it with a Bluetooth keyboard , and you can easily spend hours on this slate typing up emails or doing some other kind of light work. Yes, you can also use it for drawing, but it only supports the first-gen A", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/apple-ipad-cyber-monday-deal-2025/", "timestamp": 1764718252.9219036}

The company has kicked off its Cyber Monday promotions on all of its Pixel hardware , from the value-friendly Pixel 9a to the flagship Pixel 10 Pro XL .

Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store Our top smartphone recommendation for most people, the Google Pixel 9a (9/10, WIRED Recommends) , is a steal at $349. You get all the accoutrements you'd want in a phone, from wireless charging and a reliable dual-camera system to solid day-long battery life and excellent performance for the money. Google also promises seven years of software support, which is unmatched at this price, and there's plenty of fresh software smarts that you'll find useful every day, like Call Screening, which will cut down the number of spam calls you get. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store A much better value than its predecessor, the Pixel 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the few smartphones at its MSRP with a triple-camera system that includes a 5X optical zoom camera. 5X! You can zoom in and capture your kid on stage at the school holiday concert in pristine quality. That makes it an even better buy at $599. Performance is a step up from the Pixel 9a, as is the selfie camera, and there are a few new exclusive software features —like the ability to AirDrop with iPhone owners.

For more intel on sales, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup or our Cyber Monday liveblog . CurrentBody CurrentBody While we haven’t tested the Green Tea Serum or Hydrogel Face Mask (both included in this bundle), this offer is too good to pass up. The standout here is the LED Series 2, which alone retails for $470 (and is not on sale), making this deal $48 less than the mask alone. In other words, it’s a steal even if you don’t plan to use the accompanying products. The LED Series 2 is the best red light therapy mask on the market. Crafted from medical-grade silicone, it hugs your face with 236 bulbs, ensuring direct contact. It delivers three wavelengths—red (633 nanometers), near-infrared (830 nanometers), and deep near-infrared (1072 nanometers)—to target skin rejuvenation at multiple depths. I’d recommend this splurge to people who’d like to target fine lines, wrinkles, or sun damage. Reviewer Nena Farrell also noted visible improvements in her acne scarring. Drybar Amazon Drybar Sephora We know and love Drybar, especially the Double Shot Oval, which, frankly, is the best blow-dryer brush we've tried. Reviewer Nena Farrell has fine, curly hair that tends to frizz, and she says the Double Shot can smooth it out and still deliver volume, thanks to its ionic technology and 2.4-inch oval barrel.

Let's move on.", "content": "My little theory is that the concept of “imprinting” in psychology can just as easily be applied to programming: Much as a baby goose decides that the first moving life-form it encounters is its parent, embryonic programmers form ineradicable attachments to the patterns and quiddities of their first formative language. For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described. My dislike for it was immediate. To arrive at a language late is to see it without the forgiving haze of sentimentality that comes with imprinting—the fond willingness to overlook a flaw as a quirk. What I saw wasn’t a bejeweled tool but a poor little thing that hadn’t quite gotten the news that the world of programming had moved on. Ruby was created in 1995 by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro Matsumoto, affectionately called “Matz.” Aside from creating the only major programming language to have originated outside the West, this Osaka-born practicing Mormon is also known for being exceptionally nice, so much so that the Ruby community adopted the motto MINASWAN, for “Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.” Befitting this, as well as its pretty name, Ruby is easy on the eyes. Its syntax is simple, free of semicolons or brackets. More so even than Python —a language known for its readability—Ruby reads almost like plain English. Programming languages are generally divided into two camps: statically typed a", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/ruby-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/", "timestamp": 1764718253.7965362}

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

It also introduced new standards for various sectors, reflecting a strategic shift towards modernization. The moves aim to facilitate compliance for manufacturers.", "content": "New Delhi: India has begun one of its most sweeping standards overhauls in recent years, withdrawing 22 quality control orders (QCOs) over the past month while simultaneously issuing a fresh set of upgraded standards across telecom networks, fibre optics, lifts, domestic gas stoves and cybersecurity. The moves—announced through multiple notifications over the past month—ease compliance pressures and mark a shift towards modernising India's technical rulebook, as the country expands its digital and urban infrastructure at an unprecedented pace. Fifteen QCOs were withdrawn in mid-November and another seven on Monday, many of which covered petrochemical intermediates critical for downstream industries, including plastics and polymers and textiles and apparel. The government's quality control orders mandate compliance with specific Indian Standards for certain products. Manufacturers and importers are required to obtain a Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) licence and use the BIS mark before selling the products in India. This is meant to ensure that the product is safe, consistent, and reliable for industrial use, as well as public health. As per the 1 December order, the withdrawn chemical QCOs include those for p-xylene, toluene, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, vinyl acetate monomer, ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer, which had made BIS certification mandatory since 2021. These chemicals are used to make polyester, polyethylene terephthalate packaging used in the food and beverages industry, paints and coatings, adhesives, acrylics, and pipes. An industry executive said certification for these globally-traded chemicals had proved difficult to secure after the QCO rollout and risked disrupting supply chains in polyester, plastics, adhesives and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing.

Despite describing the discussions as “useful” and “constructive”, the Kremlin said the sides remained far apart on core issues, including territorial control. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian media that after a nearly five-hour meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Moscow and Washington were “neither further nor closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine. There is a lot of work to be done.” Ushakov added that while the meeting was “extremely useful, constructive, and informed”, no agreement had been reached on fundamental questions. “Some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the wording we’ve been offered isn’t acceptable, so the work will continue.” He said the Russian side had received four new documents from the US, in addition to the original peace plan, but that major divergences remained. “We did not discuss … specific American proposals, but discussed the essence of what is embedded in these American documents. We could agree with some things … and the president also did not hide our critical and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.” Putin’s warning that Russia is prepared for confrontation with Europe overshadowed the diplomatic push. “If Europe — all of a sudden — wants to start a war and if it does start a war, then, very rapidly, there might be a situation where we have no one to negotiate with,” a Kremlin aide quoted him as saying. The Russian president also accused European leaders of actively undermining US-driven peace efforts. “Europe's only goal is to prevent Trump from achieving peace through negotiations — they have no peace agenda.

Residents are balking as private power company officials overseeing the generation, transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico insist that additional funding is needed to modernize a crumbling grid that Hurricane Maria razed in 2017. The hearings, which do not include public input, began in mid-November and are scheduled to continue through late December. They are being held by Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau, which would decide whether to authorize the proposed increases. In total, the proposed new charges would raise a bill’s base rate from $4 per month to more than $40, according to the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico and Solar United Neighbors. “The larger issue here is the impact on low-income people … on elderly people,” P.J. Wilson, SESA’s president, said in a phone interview Tuesday. One of the proposals from Luma, the company that oversees transmission and distribution of power on the island, calls for the residential fixed charge to increase from about $4 per month to $15 starting in January. “This request from Luma represents … an unjustified economic blow to households and families on the island,” said Javier Rúa-Jovet, SESA’s public policy director. He said in a phone interview that there is currently no analysis justifying that request. Meanwhile, Wilson warned there are other repercussions related to recent requests for additional fixed charges. “It makes the financial case to go solar worse, and worse and worse,” he said.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, said it would be better to attempt dialogue or impose economic pressure on Venezuela if Washington wants to pursue change there. The Trump administration has been weighing options to combat what it has portrayed as Maduro's role in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans. The socialist Venezuelan president has denied having any links to the illegal drug trade. Asked during a news conference about Trump's threats to remove Maduro by force, Leo said: \"It is better to search for ways of dialogue, or perhaps pressure, including economic pressure\". The pope, speaking as he flew home from a visit to Turkey and Lebanon, his first overseas trip, added that Washington should search for other ways to achieve change \"if that is what they want to do in the United States\". Reuters reported last month that options under U.S. consideration include an attempt to overthrow the Venezuelan leader, and that the U.S. military is poised for a new phase of operations after a massive military buildup in the Caribbean and nearly three months of strikes on suspected drug trafficking boats off Venezuela's coast. Leo, answering a journalist's question, also said the signals coming from the Trump administration about its policy toward Venezuela were unclear. \"On one hand, it seems there was a call between the two presidents,\" said the pope, referring to a phone call that Trump had with Maduro last month. \"On the other hand, there is the danger, there is the possibility there will be some activity, some (military) operation.\" \"The voices that come from the United States, they change with a certain frequency,\" added Leo.

As the first Cabinet member to speak, Hegseth reaffirmed the Pentagon’s commitment to striking alleged narco-boats. \"As I've said and will say again, we've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean,\" Hegseth said. \"Because they have been poisoning the American people. And Joe Biden tried to approach it with kid gloves.\" The Defense Secretary highlighted the broader goals of the strikes : stopping the flow of drugs and eliminating threats. \"We're stopping the drugs, we're striking the boats, we're defeating narco-terrorists,\" Hegseth added. Hegseth defended the second strike by citing the “fog of war”, emphasizing the uncertainty and confusion inherent in combat operations. Hegseth stated: -He did not see survivors in the water at the time of the second strike. -The vessel was already on fire, which influenced the decision. -He did not remain for the remainder of the mission after the first strike. -The admiral in charge had “complete authority” to order the follow-up strike and, in his view, “made the right call.” The comments come amid scrutiny over Pentagon operations in the Caribbean. A report said a follow-up strike in September that killed survivors of an earlier attack. Hegseth’s remarks signal continued aggressive action against alleged narco-terrorist activities at sea. The meeting comes after The Washington Post reported that a follow-up strike on September 2 targeted survivors of an earlier attack.

The committee, led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) member of parliament Bhartruhari Mahtab, in its report on the working of IBC tabled in Lok Sabha said that while the code has strengthened creditor confidence and encouraged both domestic and foreign investment, its potential remains hampered by persistent systemic challenges. This, the panel said, requires immediate and targeted intervention across all fronts. Judicial capacity must be scaled up with new benches of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), accountability for resolution professionals must be fixed by empowering the panel of creditors and streamlining disciplinary actions, and finality of approved plans must be guaranteed through express legislative amendment, the parliament committee said. The panel added that procedural ambiguity must be removed with rules. “The committee, therefore, urge the ministry of corporate affairs to ensure expeditious implementation of these reforms in a manner that fully realizes their intended impact, leveraging the IBC Amendment Bill, 2025 to realize the full potential of the Code, maximizing enterprise value, safeguarding stakeholder interests, promoting financial stability, and reinforcing India’s position as a favourable destination for business,” the report said.

In 2023, she began her career as a content creator and now collaborates with prominent brands such as Dior and Cetaphil. Fang is originally from Taiwan and was raised between Taiwan and Hong Kong, attending international schools before relocating to Canada. In an interview with Allure, she mentioned that she is very close to her mother, whom she describes as “the strongest woman” she knows. She spent her high school years juggling part-time jobs , including working at Brandy Melville and serving as a hostess at Vancouver’s Cactus Club Cafe. During that period, she had a modest following on TikTok, but everything changed when she was unexpectedly called to work at Cactus Club Cafe on a rainy day, according to a report by South China Morning Post.  She started crying and recording her emotional breakdown while doing her makeup on camera. The video went viral, launching her career in content creation. Her relatable personality even earned her a contract with United Talent Agency, the report said. “In 2023, she filmed herself crying while getting ready for yet another long shift, a video that unexpectedly went viral. People came for the relatability but stayed for Fang's makeup tips and unfiltered personality,” Forbes said. Fang, currently an undergraduate at NYU, earned roughly $4 million last year as a beauty influencer. Her classmates likely admire her for securing brand deals with Dior, representing Cetaphil's campaigns, and featuring on billboard ads, Forbes noted.

The visit marks the latest effort by Trump to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. Trump has previously sought to mediate peace, including a summit with Putin in Alaska in August and meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but so far, no agreement has been reached. A leaked US draft of 28 peace proposals last week raised concerns among Ukrainian and European officials. Critics argued that the proposals largely aligned with Moscow’s key demands, including restrictions on Ukraine’s military and Russia’s control of a fifth of Ukrainian territory. European powers subsequently offered their own counter-proposals. Zelensky emphasized Ukraine’s commitment on social media: “Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security. This is exactly the level of commitment that must be compelled from the Russian side.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed, as per Reuters, that Putin would meet Witkoff and Kushner, but refrained from commenting on Russia’s \"red lines,\" noting that megaphone diplomacy is unhelpful. The envoys were accompanied only by an interpreter. Putin has indicated he is open to discussions but warned that if Ukraine rejects an agreement, Russian forces could advance further.

Giving Tuesday 2025 is today, 2 December, marking a day for people across the United States and the world to give back to their communities, support local organisations, and help those in need. The Giving Tuesday movement was started in 2012 as a simple idea: a day to encourage people to do good. It has since exploded into a global phenomenon, unleashing the power of radical generosity. The movement has raised billions of dollars for non-profit organisations globally since its inception. In the US alone, participants donated an estimated $3.6 billion in 2024, supporting causes ranging from at-risk youth and the environment to animal shelters and food insecurity. While financial donations are always essential for non-profits to sustain their vital work, there are many meaningful ways to participate in Giving Tuesday that don't involve sending cash. Generosity comes in many forms—of time, skills, goods, and voice. Many organisations, such as women's shelters, community fridges, children's hospitals, and animal shelters, are always accepting tangible, essential items. This can be a great opportunity to declutter before the end of the year and donate gently used clothes, blankets, or books. One of the most valuable gifts you can give is your time and expertise. Look for a social cause or organisation that matters to you and reach out to them directly. Join volunteer programmes at local hospitals, animal shelters, food banks, or community cleanup initiatives. Share Professional Skills (Pro Bono) : Leverage your expertise in fields such as marketing, accounting, programming, law, or healthcare.

The same company owns brands like Labour Union, as per a report by Lizhi News. Meanwhile, the incident has created a storm on the internet after someone posted the tag online. It has now gone viral. The incident has gained mixed reactions from netizens. One of them was quoted saying by the South Morning China Post: “How come you let your beloved women do the chores for you? This is apparent exploitation. Why not print the complete washing method and add a sentence ‘please finish reading this and learn how to wash clothes for the sake of your beloved person’.” “Which brand is this?

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.
