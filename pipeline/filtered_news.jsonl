The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers.

The petitions question the constitutional validity of the 2022 Act, particularly the hike in SC/ST reservation, from 15 per cent to 17 per cent for SCs and from 3 per cent to 7 per cent for STs. Other Backward Classes (OBCs) reservation continues to remain at 32 per cent, which takes over all reservations in the state to 56 per cent. The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters. The government had earlier argued that halting ongoing recruitments would disrupt administrative functioning due to manpower shortages.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost. A recent report by The Indian Express shows that 93 per cent of London businesses say international talent helps address skills shortages, and 84 per cent believe internatio", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indian-students-highest-cohort-leaving-united-kingdom-immigration-rule-limits-intake-ons-data-10390931/", "timestamp": 1764772172.9024596}

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

His advice to aspirants: – Focus on strengths, avoid comparison, drink enough water, and sleep well. “CAT is not about knowing everything; it’s about knowing what you know well.” What to avoid: – No late-night study – No new topics – No scrolling through forums – Don’t freeze if the first few questions look tough “Don’t let someone else’s stress become yours.” How he attempted the paper: A quick scan, attempt the obvious ones, mark the rest, no over checking. “Move fast, trust yourself, don’t overthink.” Also Read | CAT 2025: Common mistakes aspirants make and how to avoid them Apoorva Rajadhyaksha , who scored a perfect 100 percentile i", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-what-toppers-did-in-the-last-few-days-before-test-mba-admission-iim-10384785/", "timestamp": 1764772179.8808012}

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said. The government is also working to finalise a transparent transfer policy, he said. “A government doctor (MBBS) is required to serve three years in a rural hospital to get a chance to pursue MD or MS.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances.

Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

In the Top Song Quiz, for instance, you can try to guess which top song soundtracked your year before seeing the results. The new interactive Wrapped Party feature isn’t just about comparing the personal streaming data you’ve already received to your friends’ data, as that’s something people already do on social media. Instead, the feature presents unique data stories for your group, like who’s the “most obsessed fan,” the “early bird,” the most “picky listener,” or even something as nice as the “dinner table explainer,” meaning the person who listens to the most news p", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/spotifys-2025-wrapped-becomes-a-multiplayer-experience/", "timestamp": 1764772523.5687954}

The new round, which opens on December 10, will enable consumers to buy the company’s shares at its Series C valuation of $1.3 billion . The company said it has so far raised $8 million in total from over 8,000 people across two previous community investment rounds. It held its first community funding event in 2021, aiming to raise $1.5 million . “This isn’t about raising capital, it’s about giving our community/fans a chance to invest while we’re private and join us on the journey,” a spokesperson for Nothing told TechCrunch. Community investors have a rotating seat on the company’s board, but it is unclear what else they get for investing in the company through such rounds. Nothing raised $200 million in its Series C back in September from investors including Tiger Global, GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF and Tapestry. The company has raised $450 million to date. The community round comes as Nothing makes changes to its corporate structure as it tries to increase its share of a smartphone market dominated by giants like Samsung and Apple. The company is spinning off its budget CMF brand , and plans to explore AI-centric devices while it keeps building smartphones and audio products. And Nothing claims it crossed $1 billion in cumulative revenue this year, up 150% from 2024. The startup is working to be “IPO-ready” in three years, CEO Carl Pei told TechCrunch in an email. “The timing will depend on market conditions and what makes sense for the business at that point in time,” he said. “What’s important is that we’re already operating with that discipline now. We’re building the systems, the governance, the financial discipline that a public company needs. It forces us to think longer-term and make smarter decisions that prioritise sustainable growth,” Pei added. It’s not clear if Nothing aims to raise another round before an IPO.

On Wednesday, the Indian telecom ministry said Sanchar Saathi, an anti-theft and cybersecurity protection app, would remain voluntary, and that smartphone makers would no longer be required to preload it on devices they sell. The new notice effectively reverses a directive issued to manufacturers last week (and circulated online on Monday) that had instructed manufacturers to bake the app into all devices and prevent its features from being disabled. News of the mandate soon ignited concerns over privacy and state overreach. “Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, the government has decided not to make pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” the ministry said. However, the government has not yet issued an official notification to smartphone makers reflecting the withdrawal, and manufacturers are still waiting for formal instructions, two manufacturer sources involved with the proceedings told TechCrunch. Since its release in January 2025, Sanchar Saathi has so far been downloaded 14 million times, and contributes information on roughly 2,000 cyber-fraud incidents per day, per the Indian government. The recent controversy boosted interest in the platform, and the ministry noted that about 600,000 citizens registered to download the app on December 2 alone. The telecom ministry’s notice follows much confusion over whether the app was truly voluntary, as the government claimed. Telecom minister Jyotiraditya Scindia had insisted earlier this week that users could delete Sanchar Saathi at any time, even though the directive circulating among manufacturers stated that the app’s functionalities “must not be disabled or restricted.” The conflicting signals fueled criticism that the government was attempting to do", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/after-intense-backlash-india-pulls-mandate-to-pre-install-government-app-on-smartphones/", "timestamp": 1764772523.767916}

A year after announcing their partnership, Uber and Avride have launched a commercial robotaxi service in Dallas. The service comes with a few caveats, however, including the addition of a human safety operator behind the wheel, and a limited operating area. The companies said fully driverless operations, without a safety operator, will begin in the future and the service area will expand. For Uber, the launch closes out a year of rapid dealmaking — and deployments — with a variety of autonomous vehicle technology companies, including Waymo, China’s WeRide and San Francisco-based startup Nuro. To date, Uber has locked in 20 partnerships with AV companies across freight, delivery and robotaxis, some of which are now in commercial operation. Uber offers autonomous vehicles through its ride-hailing app in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh with WeRide , and in Atlanta, Austin, and Phoenix with Waymo. Uber said it plans to have autonomous vehicles on its network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. Over the next two years, the plan is to launch AVs on its app in Arlington, Texas, Dubai, London, Los Angeles, Munich and the San Francisco Bay Area. Many of these partnerships have included an investment by Uber, and Avride, an Austin-based startup that sits under parent company Nebius Group, is one of those. In October 2024, the ride-hailing company struck a multi-year deal with Avride to bring its sidewalk delivery robots and autonomous vehicles to both Uber Eats and Uber. Within months, Avride’s sidewalk robots began delivering food via the Uber Eats app in Austin, Dallas and Jersey City. This fall, Avride secured strategic investments and commercial commitments worth $375 million from Uber and Nebius, which was previously known as Yandex NV, the Netherlands-based company that sold off its Russian business in 2024.

The new goal is to create interfaces and modalities that make it easier for users to create a habit of logging their meals or workouts, along with having an ever-present AI assistant that can guide people in areas like nutrition and exercise. Khosla-backed health startup Healthify on Tuesday launched a new version of its health assistant Ria, which you can converse with live, via voice, and by using the camera for getting input about your food. The startup is using OpenAI’s tech to power this conversational mode. With this release, Ria supports more than 50 languages, including 14 Indian languages. The company said that it can also support mixed language input like Hinglish or Spanglish. While the company is largely utilizing OpenAI’s models for this release, it said that in the future it could use other models if needed. Through the new version of Ria, users can ask for their health overview for specified time frames like day, week, or month, or an overall summary. The app can pull data from different sources like fitness trackers, sleep trackers, or glucose monitors to give users insights about exercise, sleep, readiness, and glucose spikes, and give suggestions. Just like Google Gemini’s Live Conversation mode, you can point the camera to ask about different food items and their nutritional value, then log them. Healthify also showed off a demo of using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to converse with Ria in real time and use the device’s camera to log food. The startup believes its users will feel more comfortable chatting in real time with an assistant. Plus, they can do multiple things in one session, such as getting insights, generating an exercise plan, or logging their goals. If you forget to log your food for the day, you can describe your meals in one go instead of typing them out, and the assistant will log them for you.

The unsurprising theme is AI for the enterprise, although this year it’s all about upgrades that give its customers greater control to customize AI agents — including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the announcements that got our attention. TechCrunch will continue to update this article through the end of AWS re:Invent, so be sure to check back. AWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%. AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform . One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents. AWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.

Just like many of Bending Spoons’ previous acquisitions, including Evernote, Meetup, Vimeo, and AOL, Eventbrite has a strong brand, but the company’s business has stopped growing, according to audited financials. The events marketplace and ticketing company was co-founded in 2006 by the husband-and-wife team Julia and Kevin Hartz, and Renaud Visage. During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised approximately $330 million in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management. Unlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at $11 billion . Besides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as “venture zombie” companies. These firms include Constellation Software, Curious , Tiny , SaaS.group , Arising Ventures , and Calm Capital . Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys “great companies” at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins . Audited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite’s trailing 12 months’ revenue of $295 million.

That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface. Google calls this conversational feature AI Mode . It launched to U.S. users this May , and to global users this August, allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT. However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual. But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead. Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more.

Each of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now. Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time. Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.” As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently. “You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday. “It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said. Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention.

Players with a Netflix subscription can now download the game, which features mobile-friendly controls, including touch-screen shooting and navigation. It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available. Originally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.  The inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has faced challenges in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when estimates revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year. Red Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise. The launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of games on smart TVs in October.

According to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia , ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday. However, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%. The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session. Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year. In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app. Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season.

The cloud provider launched Nova 2, a fleet of four new AI models to its Nova model family, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s AWS re:Invent keynote on Tuesday. The first version of AWS Nova was announced last year at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service. “The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.” The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding. Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images. Alongside the model upgrades, AWS also announced a new service called Nova Forge which allows AWS cloud customers to build their own frontier version of AWS Nova models called Novellas for $100,000 a year , according to CNBC reporting. This service allows enterprises to access pre-trained, mid-trained or post-trained models for companies to then train on their own proprietary data.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug. The five-and-a-half-hour livestream, which has been viewed more than 1.1 million times, also featured Johnson’s 20-year-old son Talmage, whose blood he has injected in his efforts to stay young, journalist Ashlee Vance, a DJ set from Grimes, and Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff. YouTuber MrBeast, while pictured on a cartoonish poster advertising the event, did not show up, which most extremely high people would probably count as a blessing. Observers noted that livestreaming an intense psychedelic trip might not be beneficial, since it can lead to fragmented attention and performance stress.

Below, you'll find everything that made the cut and is still on sale: True discounts on the gear and gadgets we'd recommend to our friends and family. Updated December 2, 2025: We've updated these deals to highlight ongoing discounts on the best earbuds for Android, some Bose headphones, a new deal on the best office chair we've tested, our favorite green powders, and more. Jump to section: Computers , Mobile Devices & Charging , TV & Audio , Home & Kitchen , Beauty & Wellness , Travel Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon Dell had a killer $500 discount all weekend on the Core Ultra 5 version of its Dell 14 Plus. It was a high-end laptop being sold for downright budget-level prices. It's sold out now, unfortunately. But the current discount is still quite good. It's on a slightly more powerful configuration with the Core Ultra 7, as well as the same 2560 by 1600 resolution screen. This is a very strong display for a laptop at this price. While the Surface Laptop is better in many ways, the $650 Dell 14 Plus gets you a full terabyte of storage. —Luke Larsen Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Microsoft's Surface Laptop is the closest thing the Windows world has to a MacBook, and it's never been so cheap.

If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes. The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to autom", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/", "timestamp": 1764772527.896269}

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says. One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit , which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform’s rules.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data. The stakes are high for AWS to get this right. While Amazon’s cloud unit dominated the smartphone era, smaller rivals like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have grown at higher rates since the arrival of ChatGPT.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Melinda French Gates, welcome to The Big Interview . Thank you so much for being here. MELINDA FRENCH GATES: Thanks for having me, Katie. So we always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. It's a warmup. Get your brain working, get your muscles working. Are you ready? I am ready.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine , Gavin Kliger , Marko Elez , Akash Bobba , and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment. The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers , consolidating data across agencies , and importing private sector practices —remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles. “That’s absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-doge-doing-now/", "timestamp": 1764772528.481831}

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications.

It has the things you want: good performance and battery life, a big enough screen, a price that makes it feel worth it. This deal is an even more terrific deal, just $274. The price has been a bit unstable on Amazon, depending where you live, but the deal's still live in all its glory at Walmart and some other retailers.

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change. Update: The $500 discount has sold out, however, you can still buy the Core Ultra 7 model for $650.

I just came across this excellent sale on Vego's kitchen composter, crowned Fastest Breakdown in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters and Food Recyclers . These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies. We haven't tested any of the below items—I might for my Gifts for Plant Lovers guide—but here are some other sales on interesting Vego items that might be worth checking out: • Raised Garden Bed Kit for $153 ($27 off) : OK, I might actually buy this myself.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Updated December 1: We've updated pricing on these deals, and added two new deals for the LG S95TR and Sony Bravia Theater Quad. Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room. Sony Amazon B&H An upgraded pick for the discerning ear, the Sony Bravia Theater System 6 is marked down by 25% on Amazon for Cyber Monday . This 5.1 surround system is helmed by an impressive soundbar in a surprisingly compact package, assisted by a chunky subwoofer and two surround speakers. While it lacks upfiring speakers, it makes up for it with excellent detail and smooth transitions around the system. If you crave real surround with physical speakers to compliment your soundbar, this is a great pick. JBL Amazon Walmart JBL Another option with an included subwoofer that's a little more budget-friendly, the JBL Bar 500MK2 boasts a big, bassy subwoofer that helps round out the physical limitations most soundbars fight against.

This one offered by Amazon , for example, is a Gorilla Tag bundle, which is currently the most popular game on the platform. It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played. For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR.

Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them.

The 25,000-mAh is plenty large (and still airline-compliant ), and it can deliver up to 165 watts to two devices (100 watts for a single device). That's enough to recharge a MacBook Air or even a Pro. Read our Best Power Banks guide for more. Nimble Amazon (Medium) Amazon (Small) Amazon (Large) Nimble (All) We love these power banks , which look attractive and are made with bioplastic. Sharge Amazon Just look at this power bank! It's transparent! It also can dish out 170 watts of power with its 24,000-mAh capacity. Anker Amazon Anker This ultra-portable MagSafe power bank is our favorite cheap option—even more so right now. Anker Amazon Anker This power bank has a pop-up Apple Watch charger that can deliver 5 watts and supports Nightstand mode. Nomad Amazon Nomad This is our favorite wall charger, because it can deliver a generous 65 watts of power and it's super slim. Seriously, it can fit in the teeniest of pouches in your bag or purse. It has two USB-C ports, and you can get 45 watts out of the left port and 20 out of the right.

It wants you to Max and chill with Noah Wyle in scrubs . The company offers some of the best Cyber Monday streaming deals with a ridiculously low-priced $3/month offer for basic HBO Max (it's the version with ads and 2K streaming, but still, super-cheap). Disney Plus and Hulu deals are bundled up for $5/month . Apple TV wants back in your life for $6 . Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals (2025) Explore the story Of course, this deal is only meant for new customers. Not boring ol' existing customers. If you already have basic HBO Max, you're already paying $11 for the same service, and HBO would like you to keep doing that. Streaming apps are banking on you being complacent and happy in your streaming life. Maybe they're even taking you for granted. Sometimes you can get the current deal just by threatening to cancel, or actually canceling, your account. Suddenly, you're an exciting new customer again! Another method is by using an alternate email account (perhaps your spouse's or roommate's?) and alternate payment information as a new customer. If you do use a burner email (you did not hear this from me), check in on your favorite app's terms of service to make sure you're not in violation by re-enrolling with different emails. I'll also issue the caveat that you lose all your viewing data and tailored suggestions if you sign up anew. But times and wallets are tight! And $3 HBO Max sounds pretty good. After all, every middle-aged American man needs to rewatch The Wire once every five years or so—assuming he's not the kind of middle-aged man who rewatches The Sopranos instead.

With the Aura frame Cyber Monday sale, you can get your own for your house, or as a gift for someone this holiday season. Aura's frames are the top pick of my guide to the Best Digital Photo Frames , and I've had at least one in my house (if not closer to three) for the last five years and I still can't stop raving about it. Right now, you can get most of Aura's frames on sale for anywhere from $30 to $60 off, depending on which frame you choose. Curious about the difference between Aura's frames? All of them will include the same great app experience and unlimited free photo storage, two of Aura's hallmarks, and the main difference is the screen size and the frame style. No matter which frame style you choose, I've tested all of the on-sale options and can attest they're beautiful to look at and well-made for any flat surface you want to place them on.

Both the regular frame design and the mat design are discounted to $139, though that's a larger discount for the Carver Mat since it usually retails for more. The Carver Mat is prettier with its mat-style frame, and both Carver designs sit in landscape mode only but can show portrait-oriented photos side-by-side. You can also get the holiday exclusive Stone version of the Carver , with a more textured frame, on sale for $149.

The first significant snowfall of the year just hit much of the country, from Philly to Boston to Kansas City . But not only will grilling season be back very soon, but the holidays are also actually a great time to cook outdoors , since smoking a big piece of meat leaves your oven free for sides. Which is why we're scoping some sales on our favorite grills this Cyber Monday. Most of the products on our list of the best grills are currently marked with some type of discount, though many of them have been priced that way for a while. Among the ones actually discounted, you find the T raeger Woodridge Pro that we reviewed very positively below $1,000 on Amazon , which is $200 off the price we normally see it at. Amazon has a ton of other big Traeger discounts , too, including $100 off the budget Pro Series 22 and $130 off the larger Pro 34 , which has 800-plus inches of cooking area. Traeger Amazon Home Depot You'll see a lot of sales marked for Weber products like the classic Original Kettle , but it's actually been selling for $142 for a long time, according to our tracking. You can probably wait for spring on that one. However, Recteq is another brand offering the biggest discounts we've seen recently. The Flagship 1600 is a smoker and grill with massive grate space (1600 square inches, as the name implies) and has impressive specs, including the ability to go low and slow for 40 hours nonstop with a full hopper. It also has wifi connectivity and can get up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit for searing steaks and burgers. The Cyber Monday price is $1,250 , the lowest we've tracked, and it's often sold for its full $1,600 list price. The more modestly priced kettle-shaped Recteq RT-B380 is also the cheapest we've seen it at $425.

(I know because I've been looking for days, with the assistance of my Pokémon-collecting friend whom I appreciate very much for his help.) Any such discounts are few and far between, and sell out almost immediately thanks to our old friends, the scalpers (shakes fist). Check your local card shops for cards that aren't priced scarily high over MSRP. But if you're shopping for a Pokémon fan, there are still some Cyber Monday discounts worth perusing that'll make great gifts, and I've rounded them up below. We haven't hand-tested everything in this list, but we know WIRED readers are searching for Pokémon gifts.

This little Pikachu Squishmallow can be clipped onto either, and might I say that it'd look mighty fine attached to a stocking on the morning of a certain holiday? I can attest to the clip's durability—I have a similar plush charm from the brand that I've toted to music festivals across the country. It's still going strong despite putting it through situations no keychain should be forced to endure.

Small lapses are common, but bigger changes that disrupt daily life deserve attention and a medical check.

Occasional lapses are normal, but frequent events suggest mild cognitive impairment, not just healthy ageing.​ You may feel mentally slower, lose your train of thought, or struggle to multitask or focus in noisy settings. This reflects reduced processing speed and attention with age. If it worsens or affects safety, seek assessment.​ Executive functions are planning, organizing, switching tasks, and self control. Struggling to follow steps, finish tasks, or manage finances can signal change beyond normal ageing and warrants evaluation.​ Needing extra time to find words is common.

She shared a video on Instagram, expressing shock and dismay: “This was my first time flying Air India in a long time… after 15 or 17 years, this is the first time anything like this has happened to my instrument.” In her post, Shankar pointed out that she always travels with a hard, protective case and paid a handling fee for extra care — yet found her instrument damaged on arrival. “How have you done this? I have special cases, you charge a handling fee and yet you've done this?” she asked, underlining the emotional attachment she holds with her sitar. Shankar wrote in the caption that she was “devastated and truly disturbed” by what happened. She said it felt particularly painful because she chose to fly Air India after a long gap; “it seems an Indian instrument can’t be safe with them,” she lamented, adding that she has travelled on “thousands of flights” with other airlines without even a peg on her sitar going out of tune. Her revelation has reopened a long-standing debate over how airlines handle fragile musical instruments. Many Indian musicians have previously complained of damage or loss when travelling, especially on flights where instruments must be checked in as cargo rather than carried onboard. The post has sparked a wave of reactions from fellow musicians, fans and social-media users — many expressing solidarity and frustration. Comments under her post reflect anger and sympathy, with users calling the situation “unbelievable” and demanding accountability from the airline. Musician Anvita Shankar wrote, “This is unbelievable. How terribly @airindia must’ve handled the sitar for this to happen inside those secure hard cases!!?? I’m so sorry.” Musician Vishal Dadlani wrote, “God, that’s heartbreaking! I’m so sorry.” The third user wrote, “Oh man!!!!

CM Siddaramaiah was spotted sporting the luxury timepiece at a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar. Both were reportedly wearing Cartier watches at the meeting, reported the news portal NDTV . Soon, the watches sparked social media chatter, with users questioning their price tag and the features they offer for the price. The BJP claimed in its post that Siddaramaiah was also seen wearing a Santos de Cartier. The post also claimed Siddaramaiah was wearing another expensive timepiece back in 2016, a Hublot Big Bang, which is made of precious yellow gold studded with diamonds on a chocolate-colour strap. Although this Hublot watch is no longer available for sale on the official website, grey market prices suggest it can cost upwards of ₹ 25 lakh, excluding taxes and charges, as per Chrono24 data.

According to police, the woman was heading home from work around 5am on 15 November when her husband tracked them down and rammed his vehicle into the rideshare car at least four times. The repeated collisions shattered the rear windshield and nearly sent the car plunging down a 20-foot embankment, WBAL TV reported. In the video, both women can be heard screaming as the suspect continued to pursue them. Despite the terrifying situation, the driver managed to take control and sped towards a nearby police station for safety. The driver was injured and later taken to a hospital for treatment. Police did not disclose whether the passenger suffered any physical injuries. Authorities praised the driver’s “incredible courage and quick thinking”, saying her actions likely prevented a far worse outcome. The incident is being investigated as a domestic violence case. The suspect — identified by police as the woman’s husband — is currently on the run. His name has not yet been released as officers continue to work with local agencies to locate him and ensure the victim’s safety. The internet hailed the Lyft driver as the hero and even offered help. “The driver is a hero. We need to, as a community, reward and acknowledge her accordingly. How can we do that?

If this girl is Bhodu’s daughter, then it should be looked at from an entirely different perspective,” the news agency quoted the top court's remarks. The Court ordered the State to provide free medical treatment to Sunali due to her pregnancy. The case has been scheduled for further examination on 12 December.

The Supreme Court was hearing a plea from the Centre challenging the Calcutta High Court's 26 September order, which set aside the central government's decision to deport Khatun and others to Bangladesh, labelling it as “illegal”. The bench also stated that they would eventually be brought back to Delhi, from where they were initially taken, and then deported to Bangladesh.

This programme aims to streamline property transactions, curb unauthorized constructions, and support urban planning as the population grows.", "content": "This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Even as India’s rural land-mapping has progressed substantially, most urban areas lack reliable, up-to-date maps and clear ownership data. This gap leads to land disputes, inefficient property transactions, poor municipal tax collection and delays in infrastructure planning. With over 600 million people expected to live in Indian cities by 2031, the central government implemented the NAKSHA (National Geospatial Knowledge-based Land Survey of Urban Habitations) programme to modernize and digitize India’s urban land records, which remain outdated, incomplete and often inaccurate. Once the pilot-phase survey of 157 urban local bodies, which started in February, is completed, the next phase will cover 1,000 cities, with all urban local bodies set to be surveyed within the next five years, Manoj Joshi, secretary in the Department of Land Resources, said on Wednesday. Mint explains the central government’s rationale behind implementing Naksha. What is the Naksha Programme and what does it aim to achieve? The Naksha programme leverages advanced technologies such as drone surveys, Global Navigation Satellite System mapping and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to build precise digital land records. Using cutting-edge aerial and field survey techniques, Naksha is building a comprehensive, GIS-integrated database of urban land plots. It aims to create and update urban land records to ensure accurate and reliable documentation of land ownership. Under this initiative, citizens will receive a government-backed UrPro (Urban Property Ownership Record) Card, a digital proof of ownership that simplifies property transactions. With Naksha, people no longer need to rely on piles of paper or intermediaries to validate ownership. Why is the central government implementing Naksha specifically in urban areas?

His remarks come amid political backlash over a recent directive mandating smartphone manufacturers to pre-install the app on all new and existing devices. The controversy began after a 28 November government order required all mobile phone makers to preload the state-run Sanchar Saathi safety app on every handset sold in India. The directive also mandated pushing the app to existing devices via software updates and ensuring that it is “readily visible and accessible to end users” upon first use. Opposition leaders and digital rights advocates criticised the mandate as a potential surveillance tool, claiming the app could monitor calls and messages. Some smartphone manufacturers — including Apple, according to industry sources — reportedly expressed reservations and sought discussions with the Centre, arguing that the order was impractical in its current form. Jyotiraditya Scindia categorically rejected the allegations during Question Hour in the Lok Sabha. “Sanchar Saathi app se na snooping sambhav hai, na snooping hoga,” he said, stressing that the app is designed solely for citizen protection. The Union minister added that the government’s objective is to empower users, not intrude on their privacy: “The government want to give power in the hands of the people to help them protect themselves.” Amid the escalating row, Scindia softened the Centre’s stance on compulsory installation, clarifying on Tuesday that users are not obliged to keep the app. “If you want to delete it, then delete it,” he told reporters outside Parliament. He emphasised that the app remains inactive unless the user chooses to register, countering claims of covert surveillance.

Earlier in September 2025, former JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna has approached the Karnataka High Court appealing against his conviction in a rape case. A special court that convicted Prajwal Revanna last month had sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life and imposed fines, in one of the four sexual abuse and rape cases against him. The Special Court for MPs/MLAs, Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat, who sentenced the convicted politician under various sections of the IPC on August 2, had imposed a total fine of ₹ 11.50 lakh on him, and had said ₹ 11.25 lakh from this fine amount will be paid to the victim. Revanna, who was arrested in May last year after returning from Germany, is contesting the verdict on several grounds, including what he claims are contradictions in the survivor's testimony and inconsistencies in the evidence produced by the prosecution. The case in which Prajwalb Revanna has been sentenced pertains to the one involving 48-year-old woman who was working as a help at the family's Gannikada farmhouse in Hassan district's Holenarasipura. She was allegedly raped twice -- at Hassan farm house and Bengaluru residence-- in 2021 and the act was recorded by the accused on his mobile phone. The allegations against the 34-year-old former Indian MP first came to light in 2023 after hundreds of explicit videos featuring him started circulating on social media, causing outrage across the country. Revanna had denied the charges.

The threats were sent in separate emails to the two colleges, Delhi police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Raja Banthia said the principal of Ramjas College alerted authorities shortly after the message arrived at 1.59 am, prompting the immediate deployment of police personnel and anti-sabotage teams.

Signed on 18 February by India and Russia, the Reciprocal Exchange of Logistic Support (RELOS) agreement was sent to the Duma last week for ratification by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. “Our relations with India are strategic and comprehensive, and we value them. We understand that today's ratification of the agreement is another step toward reciprocity and, of course, the development of our relations,” Vyacheslav Volodin, Speaker of State Duma, said in the house, as per a PTI report. In a note posted on the Duma website, the Russian Cabinet of Ministers said the ratification “will facilitate mutual use of the two countries' airspace and port calls by Russian and Indian warships”. It added that RELOS “will strengthen military cooperation between the two countries”. Vladimir Putin will make a two-day visit to India, meeting President Draupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi . They will discuss a number of issues, including trade and defence, and further strategic bilateral ties. The state visit to India will be from 4 to 5 December, during which he will attend the 23rd India-Russia Annual Summit and hold talks with Modi. Murmu will also receive Putin and host a banquet in his honour. This visit will mark Putin's first visit to India since 2021. The two leaders last met in person in September this year in Tianjin, China, on the sidelines of the SCO Summit . Earlier, the Kremlin said that both sides would adopt a joint statement and sign a \"wide range of interdepartmental and business agreements\" following the talks between the leaders. The two sides are also likely to focus on deepening cooperation in areas of civil nuclear energy, as per reports.

Is India affected?", "summary": "The US has paused immigration applications from 19 travel-ban nations, freezing green card and citizenship processing. Is India impacted, and what happens next?", "content": "The Donald Trump administration has imposed an immediate pause on all immigration applications filed by nationals of 19 countries previously placed under a US travel ban, triggering widespread cancellations of green card interviews and naturalisation ceremonies. The move, confirmed by senior officials and reported by The New York Times on Tuesday, marks one of the broadest immigration slowdowns in recent years and deepens the administration’s post-attack security crackdown. The suspension comes days after two National Guard members were shot near the White House in Washington, an incident authorities have linked to Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan man who obtained asylum in April. In response, the administration announced sweeping new vetting measures and signalled that further restrictions could follow. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) spokesperson Matthew Tragesser defended the decision. “The Trump administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” NYT quoted Tragesser. “We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake.” The pause applies only to people from the 19 nations previously included in the June travel ban, which reportedly covers Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Haiti, Somalia, Venezuela and several other low-income or conflict-affected countries. India is not on the travel-ban list and is therefore not impacted by this application pause. Indian applicants for US green cards, H-1B visa adjustments, American citizenship, and other immigration benefits should not experience cancellations tied to this specific policy change. The freeze affects multiple stages of the immigration system: “Everything is being put on hold,” said Texas immigration lawyer Ana Maria Schwartz. “It is just like a traffic jam, and it is just going to get worse and worse and worse.” Some applicants, including long-time US residents, were notified that their cit", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-halts-immigration-applications-from-travel-ban-nations-what-it-means-for-green-cards-citizenship-and-india-11764723706374.html", "timestamp": 1764772573.027767}

Proposed updates intend to improve transparency and modernize outdated rules, but face pushback from asset management firms regarding potential income impacts and privacy concerns for Sebi employees.", "content": "This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. The board of India's stock market regulator will take up the most sweeping revision of regulations in decades spanning mutual funds, stock brokers and its own officials later this month, two people aware of the meeting's agenda said. The board will discuss bringing in new rules, updating outdated rules, and removing overlapping ones. In October, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) proposed to cap brokerage and transaction costs that mutual funds charge beyond annual fees collected under their total expense ratio (TER). Sebi also proposed to scrap the additional five basis points charged over the exit load and a more comprehensive disclosure of the TER, which is used to cover management and operating costs. “Mutual fund regulations and stock broker norms will definitely be part of the Sebi agenda,\" one of the two people cited above said on the condition of anonymity. The regulator's board will meet on 17 December. A Sebi spokesperson did not respond to Mint's queries. The proposed overhaul of mutual fund regulations aims to improve transparency in costs and charges levied by mutual funds; however, the regulator's October suggestions drew criticism from asset management companies (AMC), who claim lower brokerage will squeeze income, affect research work, and lead to loss of block deals from brokers. Meanwhile, mutual fund distributors worry that AMCs will pass on some of the pain, shrinking their own income. \"If the recommendations on brokerage costs are accepted as it is, then it would have an impact on AMCs. But we are expecting Sebi to come mid-way,\" an AMC official said on the condition of anonymity. Sebi is also expected to overhaul regulations governing stockbrokers, the people cited above said, formalizing definitions for algorithmic and proprietary trading, streamlining rules that date back to 1992.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

From the AI boom to the 2024 Budget, employees in 2025 will need to be more strategic than they’ve ever been to get, and stay ahead, in their respective industries. According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.
