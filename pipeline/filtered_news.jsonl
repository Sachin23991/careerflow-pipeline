With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

I come from Chandigarh , and completed both my Class 10 and Class 12 from Shivalik Public School. My school, and the city itself, gave me a strong sense of grounding. My academic interests started shaping there, especially as I took part in debates, science exhibitions, and extracurricular activities that built my interest in public affairs and law.  After schooling, I moved to Symbiosis Law School, Noida, under Symbiosis International (Deemed) University, to pursue my BA LLB. degree.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method.

I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763669833.9702692}

From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit.

Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit.

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete.

We should be smart about our study, and try to have some expertise on some key chapters. In fact, we may have to identify topics in those chapters and then try and figure out from PYQ’s, which ones get repeated more. On that note, we can take a look at which chapters we should focus on.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

The calculator, as per the NTA, also included functions for square root, percentage, etc. However, in its recent notice, the Agency stated that the calculator feature is a part of the ‘generic test’ conducting platform and does not apply to the JEE Main 2026 exam, as the use of calculators in any form is not permitted in this examination. It explained that the onscreen calculator present during the computer-based exam format will not be available to the JEE aspirants.

According to an official statement, the programme is designed to address the challenges of India’s expanding creator economy, part of a global industry valued at over $250 billion. The new initiative seeks to bridge this gap by offering a structured curriculum that combines academic insight, business understanding, and real-world application. The course will train participants in personal branding, content strategy, and the use of emerging technologies such as generative AI for scalable content creation. It will also guide creators in brand collaborations, revenue generation, and audience engagement across multiple platforms. Led by MICA faculty and industry professionals The programme will be led by MICA professors Dr Falguni Vasavada and Prof. Siddharth Deshmukh, both active digital creators and educators. Together, they will integrate academic frameworks with practical insights from the creator ecosystem. Adding an industry perspective, Viraj Sheth, Co-founder and CEO of Monk Entertainment, will serve as the programme’s industry expert. According to MICA, Sheth will conduct two masterclasses — Media Training for Digital Thought Leaders and Multi-Platform Content Distribution & Growth Strategy — covering brand authenticity, audience growth, and long-term influence management.

The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions. The company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options. Up to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. To start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo. It’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged. OpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos. The move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience. “Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. Thursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1 , which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model.

This season is highlighting lessons learned from the world of go-to-market strategies. Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen sat down with Luna co-founder Jas Schembri-Stothart and Untapped Solutions founder Andre Peart for their unique perspectives on reaching niche customer segments following their own candidacy during the 2024 Startup Battlefield competition . If our first episode, with Deon Nicholas, co-founder of Forethought AI, we explored what it takes to create a company with a customer-first approach . And in our second episode, we’re diving into guerrilla tactics and experiments that worked in reaching two very different target audiences: teenage girls and formerly incarcerated workers. For Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse. Untapped Solutions had a different challenge. As the “LinkedIn for the formerly incarcerated,” Peart had to find a way to make sure that the platform could actually be deployed into the many places where currently or formerly incarcerated individuals could access it in order to help them attain employment.

The iOS-only app lets anyone create new AI-generated photos using “recipes,” which are like Mad Lib-style, fill-in-the-blank prompts for your photos, texts, or sketches. For instance, you could ask Mixup to turn your scribbled sketch into a beautiful Renaissance painting, or to reimagine your pet in a funny Halloween costume. You could use a selfie to see what you’d look like with a different hairstyle, or create something even sillier — like envisioning a friend transformed into the form of Italian brainrot . The app is built on top of Google’s Nano Banana, but the “recipe” format opens up a new way to interact with the model — turning a generative tool into an online party game. “The thing that [Nano Banana] did that no model did before was that it could take your image and maintain it in a convincing way that wasn’t creepy,” said Things, Inc. founder and CEO Jason Toff , whose background includes working on experimental apps inside Big Tech companies like Google and Meta, as well as time spent managing product at Twitter. But what makes Mixup particularly fun to use is that the app’s “recipes” — the user-generated AI prompts — are shareable. “Generative AI is so powerful, and yet most of the time you go to these tools and it’s like, here’s your text box — come up with something creative. And what do you write?” Toff said, speaking to the shortcomings his team saw with the current AI landscape. “And so, rather than having to be creative and think about what to create, you see something that worked, and you can just fill in the blanks,” he said. After users create a new prompt in Mixup, they can choose to publish it along with the resulting photo to a public feed or just download it for personal use. From the feed, other users can view the photo and tap the button next to it to “Try recipe.” This allows anyone on the app to r", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/mixup-is-a-new-mad-libs-style-app-for-creating-ai-images-from-photos-text-and-doodles/", "timestamp": 1763669982.0308747}

The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices. Google plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. The company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses. Quick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share. “This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a blog post . The tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen. Google notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file. The feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged. “We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.” It’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/androids-quick-share-now-works-with-iphones-airdrop-starting-with-the-pixel-10-lineup/", "timestamp": 1763669982.2292361}

And investors seem to agree. Point One Navigation, a startup that has developed precise location technology, has just raised $35 million in a Series C round led by Khosla Ventures. The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. Point One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves, from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device. For Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. To achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix. Point One started with a focus on automotive clients — a sign of the bullish autonomous vehicle technology times. That sector continues to make up a large slice of its revenue. Point One couldn’t disclose most of its commercial customer names, but it did share that its technology supports the advanced driver assistance and infotainment needs of an EV maker and is included in more than 150,000 of its vehicles.

I’m grateful for her time here and know we’ll stay close.” Asked about why she is leaving the firm, Daver was typically matter-of-fact. “I came to do a job, and the job was to build out the KV brand and to build out Vinod’s brand, and to help set up a marketing organization such that our companies and portfolios have somebody to go to. And I’ve done all of that.” It’s certainly true that when founders think of top AI investors, two to three venture firms spring to mind, and one of them is KV. It’s quite a turnaround for a firm that, for a period, was better known for Khosla’s legal battle over beach access than for his investments. The Daver effect Daver says her success at KV came down to finding the firm’s essence and hammering it relentlessly. “At the end of the day, a VC firm doesn’t have a product,” she explains", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/the-marketing-guru-who-helped-turn-khosla-ventures-into-an-ai-powerhouse-is-moving-on/", "timestamp": 1763669982.461593}

When it finally saw the year for itself, it was thunderstruck, telling him, “I am suffering from a massive case of temporal shock right now.” Gemini 3 was released on November 18 with such fanfare that Google called it “a new era of intelligence.” And Gemini 3 is, by nearly all accounts (including Karpathy’s), a very capable foundation model, particularly for reasoning tasks. Karpathy is a widely respected AI research scientist who was a founding member of OpenAI, ran AI at Tesla for a while, and is now building a startup, Eureka Labs, to reimagine schools for the AI era with agentic teachers. He publishes a lot of content on what goes on under-the-hood of LLMs . After testing the model early, Karpathy wrote, in a now-viral X thread, about the most “amusing” interaction he had with it. Apparently, the model’s pre-training data had only included information through 2024. So Gemini 3 believed the year was still 2024. When Karpathy attempted to prove to it that the date was truly November 17, 2025, Gemini 3 accused the researcher of “trying to trick it.” He showed it news articles, images, and Google search results. But instead of being convinced, the LLM accused Karpathy of gaslighting it — of uploading AI-generated fakes. It even went so far as to describe what the “dead giveaways” were in the images that supposedly proved this was trickery, according to Karpathy’s account. (He did not respond to our request for further comment.) Baffled, Karpathy — who is, after all, one of the world’s leading experts on training LLMs — eventually discovered the problem.

The company noted that in-app messaging has been a “top feature request.” When the messaging feature was first removed, the rationale behind the decision was not fully explained. It was speculated that the feature had become underutilized, a common fate for many features that are eventually discontinued. Another possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior. This concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future. YouTube is also implementing standard safety features, including requiring users to send each other invites prior to initiating a chat, as well as the ability to unsend messages, block others, and report conversations.

The new-look New Glenn will be even taller than the historic Saturn V rocket and on par with SpaceX’s Starship. This super-heavy version of New Glenn will feature nine of the company’s rocket engines on the booster stage, and four on the upper stage. That’s up from seven and two, respectively, on the current version, which Blue Origin says will continue to fly alongside the super-heavy variant. Blue Origin is now referring to the two versions as New Glenn 9×4 and New Glenn 7×2. That added firepower will increase the New Glenn booster’s total thrust and allow it to carry “over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit,” slightly below Starship’s current theoretical capacity of 100 metric tons. SpaceX is working on new versions of Starship that could double that figure. The larger New Glenn will feature a much larger fairing (the forward-facing shield that covers the rocket’s payload) to allow bigger payloads at the top of the rocket. The added capability will put Blue Origin in play for missions centered around “mega-constellations, lunar and deep space explorations, and national security imperatives such as Golden Dome.” Blue Origin is currently competing with SpaceX to help with NASA missions to the moon, and the company is clearly teasing this capability in the rendering it released of New Glenn 9×4 on Thursday. The illustration shows a theoretical view from the ground looking up at the new super-heavy rocket shortly after takeoff. Above the rocket, appearing larger-than-usual? The moon. The 7×2 version of New Glenn received some updates on Thursday as well. Its total thrust has increased, and it will now feature reusable fairings.

Google announced the move Thursday, noting that Gemini will start to roll out to Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phone. By bringing Gemini to Android Auto, Google is making it possible for users to speak naturally and have a back-and-forth conversation to complete more complex tasks on the go, according to the company. Android Auto is an app that runs on a user’s phone and wirelessly communicates and projects features like navigation, music, and messaging from an Android-based smartphone to the car’s display. The rollout doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. The company announced in May that Gemini would be coming to Android Auto this year. With Gemini, users can ask questions about businesses along their route to find something specific. For example, users could ask something like: “Hey, Google, I need your help. I’m suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?” If a spot looks interesting, Gemini can offer more information about the place, such as details about the restaurant’s most popular dish or whether the establishment is dog-friendly. Users can also reply to messages with Gemini and get summaries of texts. For instance, you can ask Gemini to let your friend know that you’re stuck in traffic and to add your ETA to the message. Or, you can ask Gemini to translate a message into a different language before sending it. Gemini also lets users access their emails in Gmail while driving. For example, a user could ask something like: “I have a hotel booked for tonight. I think the address is in my email. Can you check and navigate there?” Gemini can also give you a summary of your unread emails.

For a few months last year, everyone became convinced that specific words like “delve” or “underscore” could give models away, but the evidence is thin, and as models have grown more sophisticated, the telltale words have become harder to trace. But as it turns out, the folks at Wikipedia have gotten pretty good at flagging AI-written prose — and the group’s public guide to “Signs of AI writing” is the best resource I’ve found for nailing down whether your suspicions are warranted. (Credit to the poet Jameson Fitzpatrick, who pointed out the document on X.) Since 2023, Wikipedia editors have been working to get a handle on AI submissions, a project they call Project AI Cleanup. With millions of edits coming in each day, there’s plenty of material to draw on, and in classic Wikipedia-editor style, the group has produced a field guide that’s both detailed and heavy on evidence. To start with, the guide confirms what we already know: automated tools are basically useless. Instead, the guide focuses on habits and turns of phrase that are rare on Wikipedia but common on the internet at large (and thus, common in the model’s training data). According to the guide, AI submissions will spend a lot of time emphasizing why a subject is important, usually in generic terms like “a pivotal moment” or “a broader movement.” AI models will also spend a lot of time detailing minor media spots to make the subject seem notable — the kind of thing you’d expect from a personal bio, but not from an independent source. The guide flags a particularly interesting quirk around tailing clauses with hazy claims of importance. Models will say some event or detail is “emphasizing the significance” of something or other, or “reflecting the continued relevance” of some general idea.

On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic , a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users’ Spotify libraries. The new feature, which is rolling out now to all Spotify users, will be found in the “Your Library” section of the Spotify mobile app. To use TuneMyMusic, you’ll scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap on the new option to “Import your music” and follow the prompts to connect with the service. You can then choose the platform you’d like to transfer playlists from, and they’ll appear in your Spotify library. To be clear, this process doesn’t delete the original playlists — it only copies them over to Spotify. At launch, TuneMyMusic supports transferring playlists from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube Music, and others . The addition of the new feature ramps up the competition in the streaming wars, while also serving as a win for data portability. One of Spotify’s top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that’s built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app . That option is also available within the Android version of the Apple Music app. YouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well.

The project, dubbed “HyperVault,” comes as demand for AI compute is rising faster than companies can build the power-hungry infrastructure needed to support it. The demand-supply gap for AI compute in India is particularly stark: The country generates nearly 20% of the world’s data, but accounts for only about 3% of global data center capacity . Big tech companies and cloud providers have been investing billions of dollars to expand local capacity and tap the country’s growing adoption of AI products. With HyperVault, TCS and TPG plan to develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers with the power and network capacity required to support advanced AI workloads across major cloud regions, the companies said. Liquid cooling and high-density rack designs are growing common as the GPUs needed to power AI inference and training use significantly more power and generate more heat than conventional CPU servers. But such designs also raise questions about resource use in countries like India, where water scarcity is already a concern. In urban hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai, where much of India’s data-center capacity is concentrated, existing water stress could complicate operations. S&P Global, citing Uptime Institute estimates, noted that a 1 MW data center load can require up to 25.5 million liters of water a year for cooling, adding pressure to already strained infrastructure. The rapid building of AI data centers stands to further stress India’s power and land use, two other bottlenecks identified by industry analysts.

Dubbed Nano Banana Pro, the new model is built on Google’s latest large language model, Gemini 3 , released earlier this week. The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts, and languages. The model also has web-searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards. Google says Nano Banana Pro is geared toward giving professionals more control over images, and lets users control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. And compared to Nano Banana’s resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro. The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image. The new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities.

Platform incompatibility has fostered real-life social friction, like the “ green bubble shaming ” phenomenon, where iPhone owners exclude Android owners from group chats. But Google has been working to minimize these disruptions. The company launched a crusade to convince Apple to adopt the RCS messaging standard to fix the common messaging hiccups between Android phones and iPhones. Google also worked with Apple to create a specification for unwanted tracking alerts—when your phone identifies an AirTag or another Bluetooth tracker on your person. Today, Google is fixing incompatibility issues with AirDrop. iPhone owners have been able to easily share files, contacts, photos, and anything else through Apple's wireless sharing system, provided both parties have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Android phones have their own sharing protocol called Quick Share , but starting today and beginning with Google's Pixel 10 smartphones , Quick Share can work with AirDrop to send data to iPhones, iPads , and Macs of any variety . The caveat is that the iPhone user will need to switch AirDrop into the “Everyone for 10 Minutes” mode instead of \"Contacts Only\" mode. Google says this isn't some kind of workaround solution. It's a direct, peer-to-peer connection; your data isn't routed through a server, shared content isn't logged, and no extra data is shared. Naturally, iPhone owners will be able to send data back to Pixel 10 phones as well. Google has not worked with Apple on this cross-compatibility, as the company says it \"welcomes the opportunity\" to work with Apple so that this sharing function can work in the Contacts Only mode. “We accomplished this through our own implementation,” a Google spokesperson tells WIRED. “Our goal is to provide an easy and secure file-sharing experience for our users, regardless of who they are communicating with.” In a security blog post , Google says the underlying strategy for what makes this", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pixel-10-can-now-share-files-with-apples-airdrop/", "timestamp": 1763669984.3034952}

One of the biggest complaints against cats is that litter boxes are stinky, and you don’t want another creature’s poop just hanging out in your house. Naysayers be gone! Because thanks to ever-evolving and growing pet tech, automatic cat litter boxes have provided a hygienic, low-labor solution to the smelly litter box problem. We at WIRED—well, our WIRED cats—tested a dozen of the highest-rated and most technologically advanced automatic litter boxes on the market for at least a week, often more (using standard clay clumping litter unless otherwise indicated), to see if they were really worth the money—or the hype. Our new favorite automatic litter box is the Purobot Max Pro 2 because of its compact design and camera to monitor. The Litter-Robot 4 is a close second because of its LitterHopper attachment that easily refills litter for you. Plus, we still love the more basic Petkit PuraMax 2 (and think it's a great option for most people).

In those heady days before ChatGPT and DALL-E , and Zoom calls, Swatch launched a fancy online platform that let you, the watch-buying public, design your own Swatch watch . Well, not exactly design. More like customize. It was called Swatch x You , and it let you tweak Swatch's standard New Gent 41-mm model by selecting one of the (surprisingly limited) preset designs, which you could then move, zoom, and rotate to fit over the watch and strap. You could also add in a chip for NFC payments, and, as a final flourish, put a very short personal message on the case back (to a maximum of 15 characters). As you can tell, although a fun idea, this offering was never designed to be anything near approaching bespoke. From tomorrow, however, the MoonSwatch maker is taking its Swatch x You model and giving it an artificial intelligence makeover. Dubbed AI‑DADA, Swatch says this AI-powered design tool lets you create entirely unique watches starting from a blank canvas and using only your imagination as a guide to the final outcome. After logging into your Swatch account, you prompt AI‑DADA with your own idea, then, in less than two minutes, a “unique watch design comes to life.” To underline this uniqueness, each AI‑DADA watch carries a “1/1” sign on its case back. This Swatch and Bathing Ape collaboration is part of the work now in at AI-DADA dataset. And, just as with Swatch x You, it's possible to further customize the watch by choosing indexes or selecting the color of its mechanism. To save on data center power drains and rampant creativity run amuck, you're only allowed three prompts per day on AI‑DADA, something that Swatch is spinning as a “creative challenge that makes every attempt feel special.” Ultimately, what we have here is a new version of Swatch x You that has been plugged with image-generation software supplied by OpenAI, thus letting the general public emblazon its timepieces with whatever graphics they see fit to dream up and d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/swatchs-new-openai-powered-tool-lets-you-design-your-own-watch/", "timestamp": 1763669984.801475}

Add to that the threat of toxic air , not only from wildfire smoke but, even worse, from burning homes. Now is the time to purchase masks in the same way one would buy a first aid kit or medicine, just in case. Some masks—like our top affordable pick, the Honeywell Safety DF300 N95 Flatfold ($13 for 50) —are ideal for public transportation or for use in a theater, and others—like our top overall N95 pick, IQAir's KN95/FFP ($60 for 10) —are put on during or after a wildfire. With the risk of disruption hitting mask supply chains, along with the issues of counterfeit masks, community spread of illness, a longer and more active wildfire season, climate change, and the sometimes-vanishing guidance pages on government websites, it’s important to keep your masks at the ready. Most alarming is the Trump administration’s recent gutting of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website declares, “Due to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.” This will impact compliance and safety of new and future manufactured masks.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They’ll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says.

Apple Best Buy Amazon Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to get the bump to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance all around. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air.

But the trick to getting rid of paper is to not worry about being perfect.", "content": "Wanting to get rid of paper in your life is easy. Following through with that promise to yourself is hard. I've been mostly paperless for close to 15 years, and the trick to it for me was to think about it the same way I think about taking care of my teeth. Staying organized is a kind of hygiene. It's almost never a one-and-done cleanup job. So think about dental hygiene . We learn to brush our teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and see a dentist every six months to catch problems before they get worse. However, if you don't follow that schedule precisely, you can still have good dental hygiene. You just have to do enough . If you do almost everything you're supposed to, but you miss two days of flossing or are a few months late scheduling your next cleaning, your teeth won't suddenly fall out. With hygiene (or any kind of maintenance), you don't have to be perfect; you just have to be good enough. Going paperless is very much like that. Here, I want to share with you the plan I used to remove most paper from my life. It should help you get started, but know in advance that you don't have to stick to it exactly every moment of every day. You can mess up. You can forget. So long as you get into the habit most of the time, you'll find yourself mostly paperless in a couple of months. Decide where to keep digitized papers. A natural choice is to save them in a cloud storage service , such as Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. By saving them in the cloud, you always have a backup. If you save files locally to your device, you could lose them all if your device is destroyed, lost, or stolen. Create an inbox. An inbox is nothing more than a folder where you will save newly scanned papers by default. If you are highly organized, you might have specific folders where you want to sort each paper you scan. That's great. But where will the files go when you're feeling lazy or strapped for time?

Could this deeply misunderstood body part really be the seat of so much modern dysfunction?", "content": "I was settling into one of those airport activity tables with high stools and electric outlets at my flight’s gate, waiting for the agent to announce boarding, when I felt a gathering storm at the apex of my butt cheeks. This was my last flight after being away from home on a book tour in May. For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves. But I’d moved just fine from plane to hotel to bookstore. I’d even made a point of walking to the bookstores from hotels and back, to indulge some kind of Walt Whitman–esque fantasy. But now, at the last moment, alarm bells were going off. The pain felt as if I’d taken a hard hit to my tailbone, as I’d once done after going off a jump in an inner tube and landing ass-first on hard-packed snow. But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute. I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination. By the time I had to stand up, it was all I could do to not cry out—as bad as the pain was sitting down, standing up sent a radical guitar solo through my coccyx. At that time, I was about four months postpartum from delivering my first baby, and had had a blissful recovery, all things considered. I had pelvic muscles of steel, thanks to over a decade of lifting heavy weights, a practice I continued until two weeks before giving birth.

Our favorite machines here can turn your barista into a stranger.", "content": "Amazon Ratio Amazon Amazon Drip coffee has undergone a quiet revolution. The best coffee makers of today are nothing like the stained break-room Mr. Coffee you might remember from your first office job. Drip is now, uh, drip . The new generation of drip coffee machines is not just technologically sophisticated but kinda culturally sophisticated—exercising tight control of time and temperature and even borrowing some barista techniques from third-wave café pour-over to get beautiful, gentle, aromatic extraction without the burn or bitterness. As a longtime booster for drip coffee, I'm loving this moment. Besides, filtered coffee is good for you. What's better, most of the best drip coffee machines on this list have a lower difficulty rating than your toaster oven . My top pick, the Fellow Aiden ($400) , is a powerful machine that can account for your local elevation and has special recipes for individual coffee beans—and yet WIRED reviewer Pete Cottell managed a great mug within eight minutes of unpacking the box. My favorite full-flavored single-mug device, the Ratio Four ($259) , has only a single button. So without even trying, you can sip your drip coffee at home and say, “Man, I really taste the lychee notes in this natural-process gesha.” Or just enjoy the delicious, delicious joe. After jittering myself up testing 20 drip coffee makers this year, these are my favorite fully automated immersion-brew coffee makers that make flavorful drip, pour-over coffee, or something splendidly in between.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent. Similarly, since implementation of the Online Safety Act , Pornhub has lost nearly 80 percent of its UK viewership. The company argues that it’s a privacy risk to leave age verification up to third-party sites and that people will simply seek adult content on platforms that don’t comply with the laws. “We have seen an exponential surge in sea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pornhub-is-urging-tech-giants-to-enact-device-based-age-verification/", "timestamp": 1763669986.4983163}

In the short term, it's cheaper and easier to just leave those boxes running in a forgotten closet. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.” Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.

A draft of the order viewed by WIRED directs US attorney general Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force,” whose purpose is to sue states in court for passing AI regulations that allegedly violate federal laws governing things like free speech and interstate commerce. Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation.

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said. The CEO’s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments. But the increase was not enough to fully make up for the recent sell-off. Nvidia has enjoyed three years of booming success since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and caused a massive surge in demand for the company’s GPUs, which are used to train and operate generative AI systems. Nvidia dominates the global market for GPUs, and its latest releases have become highly sought after, with demand far exceeding supply. On Wednesday, Nvidia executives reiterated that it has about $500 billion in unfilled orders.

Aaron Saunders, who is partly responsible for giving the world back-flipping and dancing machines, joined as the VP of hardware engineering earlier this month. The hire is a key part of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis’ vision for Gemini to become a sort of robot operating system, similar to how Google supplies its Android software to an array of smartphone manufacturers. “You can sort of think of it as a bit like an Android play [...] We want to build an AI system, a Gemini base, that can work almost out-of-the-box, across any body configuration,” Hassabis said in an interview with WIRED. “Obviously humanoids, but nonhumanoids too.” Boston Dynamics is famous for developing legged robots, including four-legged dog-sized systems and humanoid machines capable of impressive acrobatic feats. Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years.

When it debuted at CES early this year, the Brisk It Zelos-450 was advertised as being \"the first grill with generative AI.\" That AI comes in the form of \"Vera,\" an in-app feature that “creates customized recipes based on your input\" and then sets the grill's temperature to cook them. The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice.

Interactions with AI tools are often mundane, but they can also lead to dire outcomes. Users sometimes experience mental breakdowns during lengthy conversations with chatbots or confide in them about their suicidal ideations . “We need to have really big conversations across society about what role we want AI to play in our future as humans who are interacting with each other,” says Ryn Linthicum, head of user well-being policy at Anthropic . At the event‚ organized by Anthropic and Stanford, industry folk intermingled with academics and other experts, splitting into small groups to talk about nascent AI research and brainstorming deployment guidelines for chatbot companions. Anthropic says less than one percent of its Claude chatbot’s interactions are roleplay scenarios initiated by users; it’s not what the tool was designed for. Still, chatbots and the users who love interacting with them as companions are a complicated issue for AI builders, which often take disparate approaches to safety . And if I’ve learned anything from the Tamagotchi era , it’s that humans will easily form bonds with technology. Even if some AI bubble does imminently burst and the hype machine moves on, plenty of people will continue to seek out the kinds of friendly, sycophantic AI conversations they’ve grown accustomed to over the past few years. “One of the really motivating goals of this workshop was to bring folks together from different industries and from different fields,” says Linthicum. Some early takeaways from the meeting were the need for better targeted interventions inside bots when harmful patterns are detected and more robust age verification methods to protect children. “We really were thinking through in our conversations not just about can we categorize this as", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-biggest-ai-companies-met-to-find-a-better-path-for-chatbot-companions/", "timestamp": 1763669988.7333033}

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763669988.8369045}

I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again. Unlike humans, industrial robots cannot typically adapt or improvise to changes or unfamiliar situations.

This initiative is called “FIFA Pass.” “FIFA Pass is a prioritized appointment scheduling system,” Infantino said from the Oval Office. “So if you have a ticket for the World Cup, you can have a prioritized appointment to get your visa. Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States. Then, the user must enter a FIFA portal, which will indicate the steps to follow in order to proceed with the visa application.

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108. Oddly, photo-based translations work with 113 languages. Lastly, real-time call translation has suppo", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/vasco-translator-q1/", "timestamp": 1763669989.8989208}

But it will cost you.", "content": "8 /10 Thrustmaster has been building a reliable fleet of high-end joypads for years now, largely through its range of ESWAP controllers featuring modular components and re-mappable inputs. It's also put out one of the better stick-drift eliminating Hall effect grips for PC and Xbox players in recent memory with 2024's H.E.A.R.T. controller . So what happens when they get thrown into a blender? Out pours the ESWAP X2 H.E., combining all the customization of the ESWAP range but finally delivering the pro-tier precision of Hall effect . It outperforms both its parents—but has also inherited some of the family's worst traits. When I reviewed the H.E.A.R.T. Controller, I termed it \"an entry-level pro controller\". By extension, the ESWAP X2 H.E. is what you might graduate to. Compared to that predecessor, it feels like a massive upgrade—from the overall build quality to the almost daunting versatility of its swappable components, everything about it feels like it's giving you more . However, for those coming from previous generation ESWAP pads , it's unlikely to seem quite so revolutionary—in fact, it's essentially the same, bar the addition of Hall effect tech. Out of the box, the X2 H.E. looks suitably impressive, a monolith of black broken up only by the copper tones of the D-pad and triggers, subtly matched by the lettering on the face buttons and dragon \"2\" of the logo. The LED color bar of the H.E.A.R.T. is gone, making this look and feel far more mature, although the mix of matte black for fixed features and glossy removable modules does make for a degree of visual inconsistency. In the hand, it's definitely better suited to those with larger grips, thanks to a chunky overall size of 160 x 120 x 60 mm and the unusual height of the default thumbstick modules. These sit about 12 mm from their base, compared to the approximately 8 mm of a standard Xbox controller, and you can immediately feel the difference. Thrustmaster ESWAP X2 H.E.

The 32-year-old Michigan engineer, who did not want to use his real name due to privacy concerns, first watched porn at the impressionable age of 12, but never realized he had a problem until just after his father’s funeral three years ago. “I didn't shed a single tear,” he says. “I didn't know how to react happily or sadly to anything.” That’s when his porn consumption spiraled—combined with stress, anxiety, and depression—and he locked himself in his room “all day.” The only thing that seemed palpable, he recalls, “was that rush of dopamine” delivered by an intense session of hardcore porn viewing. But for Jamie, who is Christian, those fleeting moments of porn-fueled transcendance were followed by far deeper lows, including suicidal ideations. This past March, Jamie says his partner angrily confronted him over his compulsive porn consumption, accusing him of lying and committing adultery. Jamie’s “entire world came down.” He admitted he felt that he was addicted, begged for her forgiveness, temporarily moved back in with his mother, and renounced porn. That’s when he found Relay , an app created by a pair of Mormon college students that claims it can help people “take back control from porn, one day at a time.” Jamie promised his partner he would never watch porn again—and she gave him one chance. The app provides a comprehensive plan to stop watching porn, with videos by therapists, daily journal prompts, live group sharing sessions, and a function to address serious urges. Users even keep track of each other’s porn-free streaks, with a “Live Milestone” ticker. This is all in an effort to help customers, who pay $149 per year for full access, unpack their underlying issues like loneliness and trauma to help prevent relapse.

The Great Meme Reset of 2026, as it’s being called on TikTok , demands that on January 1 all memes revert to their 2010s glory days. Bland “ brain rot ” and AI -looking memes are out; Big Chungus is in. As with anything on the internet, the origin of the Great Meme Reset is hard to place. Most sources point to a March post from TikTok user @joebro909 that called for a whole new generation of memes to save the platform from the “ drought ” that had engulfed it in the spring. The post said nothing of a January 1 launch date, or a return to the memes of the last decade, but the idea was planted. Now hundreds of posts are discussing the reboot—and a return to the internet’s “dank” era. Which implies, of course, that memes lack dankness these days. If anything, Gen Z– and Gen Alpha–fueled internet culture has prided itself on somewhat meaningless content like “ 6 7 ” and absurdist, seemingly AI-generated “ Italian brain rots ,” but after nearly a year of memes with little humanity or depth, a backlash has begun. “Because of just how unrecognizable memes have become,” TikTok creator Noah Glenn Carter ( @noahglenncarter ) said in a recent video, “everyone has come to an agreement that on January 1, 2026, we are going to completely reset all memes and go back to the originals.” When I reach Carter via email, the creator seems pretty convinced the reset idea could take off, and he plans to make more videos promoting it. “The memes we have now are called ‘brain rot’ for a reason,” Carter says. “The ones 10+ [years older], most of the time, had a story behind them. Or they at least made sense. Now it just seems like the more random and incoherent something is the more likely it is to become a meme.” Even if you’re in the camp that understands memes like “6 7” have more significance than they’re given credit for, there’s still a sense amongst the Great Rese", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-great-meme-reset-is-coming/", "timestamp": 1763669990.777173}

Derby Nov 20 (Reuters) - Concerns about financial market stability, including the potential for a sharp drop in asset prices, are emerging as a fresh theme for Federal Reserve officials as they debate when and even whether to cut interest rates further. In a talk at Georgetown University on Thursday, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook did not offer a view on near-term interest-rate policy specifically. But she called out a range of risks to the financial system, including fast-growing private credit markets, hedge fund trading in the Treasury securities market, and the adoption of generative artificial intelligence into machine-based trading. Cook also suggested she would not be surprised by a collapse in historically elevated asset prices - which have helped shore up overall consumer spending and the U.S. economy more broadly - though such a decline would not by itself signal financial market instability. \"Currently, my impression is that there is an increased likelihood of outsized asset price declines.\" Speaking at a separate event earlier, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack reiterated her opposition to further interest-rate cuts because inflation remains too high, and signaled she sees easy financial conditions as another argument against rate cutting.

Arnav Laxman Khaire, a first-year science undergraduate, was found hanging in his flat in Kalyan East on Tuesday evening, according to Assistant Commissioner of Police, Kalyanji Gete.  \"Arnav was travelling to his college in Mulund on a local train on Tuesday morning when the assault took place between Kalyan and Thane stations,\" he said. Gete reported that the teenager's father, Jeetendra Khaire, alleged that Arnav had asked a fellow passenger in Hindi to move slightly further into a crowded carriage.

The move aims to overhaul the country’s public finance architecture, ending decades of inconsistency in the way spending is recorded across the federal system, according to Jayant Sinha, deputy CAG (Government Accounts). The decision, notified to the Union and state governments on 11 November, brings uniformity to the Object Heads of expenditure—the most detailed level of the accounting hierarchy that classifies how each rupee of government expenditure is categorised. For years, states recorded this expenditure head in different ways, making comparisons difficult, delaying data analysis, and reducing the accuracy of budgetary assessments. Sinha said that the new standardised framework will allow uniform, transparent and comparable financial reporting for the first time. “The harmonisation “addresses a decades-long issue” and strengthens the foundations of public financial management. The list was finalised by a joint working group comprising officers from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), state governments, the Controller General of Accounts and the Controller General of Defence Accounts. While states may retain unique expenditure practices under sub-heads, the core structure will now be common nationwide. CAG has implemented another major reform by advancing the timelines for preparing Monthly Civil Accounts. These accounts, which were earlier finalised around the 25th of each month, will now have to be prepared by the 10th. Faster account compilation will provide state administrations, RBI, and other stakeholders with earlier visibility into fiscal trends, aiding budget planning and improving fiscal discipline.

It also uses dried yellow mealworms to create an unusual drink that many people find shocking. Unusual coffee trends are common in China . Some cafes add deep-fried worms to drinks while some mix fried chilli and hot pepper powder into lattes. According to Chinese doctors, yellow mealworms are rich in protein and may help improve the immune system. A museum worker says the ant-based drink tastes sour. The pitcher plant version, on the other hand, tastes like normal coffee. The roach coffee is mainly tried by curious youngsters because their parents dislike anything related to cockroaches. The shop sells over 10 cups of this unusual brew each day. “The roach coffee is mainly consumed by curious young people. Parents with children do not like it as they dislike cockroaches,” he said. Visitors say the flavour feels burnt and slightly sour, which fits the museum’s insect theme. The drink costs 45 yuan (more than ₹ 550). It is sold only inside the museum’s own cafes. “We launched this type of coffee at the end of June, and it trended on the internet recently. As an insect-themed museum, it seemed like a good idea to have drinks that match,” an employee told the Chinese media.

The visit comes soon after UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s trade mission to India and is aimed at strengthening business links, boosting investment flows and expanding collaboration in technology, education and skills.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. NEW DELHI : \n     \n      A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday held that courts cannot impose timelines on the President of India or state governors to approve bills passed by state legislatures, while urging them to respond promptly. The five-judge bench led by Chief Justice B.R. Gavai said its earlier judgment, which had introduced fixed timelines and suggested that bills could be treated as automatically approved if constitutional authorities delayed action, was incorrect. Such directions, the bench said, take away powers that the Constitution gives only to the President and governors. Other judges on the Bench were Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P.S. Narasimha and Atul S. Chandurkar. The ruling is likely to influence how impasses between state governments and governors over bill approvals are resolved and opens up the possibility of delays over bills in states relating to economic, business, financial, and infrastructure domains, among others. Like, for instance, Tamil Nadu’s Online Gambling Prohibition Bill. Passed in October 2022, the bill remained in limbo for months, leaving the gaming industry in uncertainty until assent was finally granted in April 2023. Legislative delays? The ruling comes as several states are struggling with delayed assent to important laws, slowing commercial and economic reforms and creating uncertainty for industries and investors. Under Articles 200 and 201, governors and the President hold the discretion to approve or withhold assent, but long periods of inaction have stalled policies relating to online gaming, industrial land rules, power tariffs and urban development. In Punjab, multiple bills passed in 2023, including those dealing with municipal administration and electricity reforms, were held up for months, delaying tariff decisions and slowing infrastructure planning until the Supreme Court intervened.

The NIA sought 15 days to interrogate the four accused in its custody. Principal District and Sessions Judge Anju Bajaj Chandna sent the four accused to 10 days of NIA custody. The four accused are Dr Muzammil Shakeel Ganai of Pulwama, Dr Adeel Ahmed Rather of Anantnag and Mufti Irfan Ahmad Wagay of Shopian in Jammu and Kashmir and Dr Shaheen Saeed of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. There was heavy security in the court premises with an RAF contingent deployed alongside Delhi Police personnel. Media persons were barred from entry during the court proceedings. A total of 15 people were killed and over two dozen others were injured in the Delhi blast that occurred around 7 pm on November 10 in a moving Hyundai i20 car driven by one alleged suicide bomber, Umar Un Nabi.  The NIA, the next day, took over the case from the Delhi Police and launched a massive search operation. As per the anti-terror agency, Amir had come to Delhi to facilitate the purchase of the car, which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to trigger the blast. NIA has forensically established the identity of the deceased driver of the vehicle-borne IED as Umar Un Nabi, a resident of Pulwama district and Assistant Professor in the General Medicine Department at Al Falah University at Faridabad. The anti-terror agency has also seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi. The vehicle is being examined for evidence in the case, in which NIA has so far examined 73 witnesses, including those injured in the blast that rocked the national capital.

Severe child deprivation has decreased by one-third since 2000, marking a significant milestone in global development, the UN children's agency said in its report The State of the World's Children 2025. “So far this century, countries have made progress towards reducing child poverty as measured by severe deprivation. Estimates show that poverty based on severe deprivation in at least one area has fallen by one third since 2000 in low- and middle-income countries,” the report said. However, about two in five children worldwide still faced severe deprivation, the report noted. In India, as many as 206 million children experience at least one deprivation, but fewer than one-third, or 62 million, experience two or more, according to the report. Unicef defines child deprivation as the absence of resources children need to survive, develop, and thrive, reflecting shortfalls across several essential categories like nutrition, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education, and adequate housing. Nearly 412 million children, or one in five globally, still live in extreme monetary poverty, surviving on less than $3 a day, with the burden most acute in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the report said.  The agency highlighted five policy strategies that have helped countries sharply reduce child poverty: elevating it as a national priority; creating fiscal space that protects child-related spending; expanding inclusive social protection, such as universal and targeted cash transfers; strengthening access to quality public services; and promoting decent work and social security for caregivers. But the report cautioned that these gains are increasingly under threat with climate change , rising armed conflict, and severe funding pressures converging to create an im", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/child-poverty-unicef-severe-child-deprivation-child-poverty-india-11763635368215.html", "timestamp": 1763670038.811146}

Alipov made the comment in an interview with TASS. The ambassador stated that Russia is ready to continue providing the most favorable terms to New Delhi for the purchase of energy resources. “Despite the obstacles put in place by the West, we remain the largest supplier of oil to India,” the ambassador told TASS. He added that American sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil may, of course, influence the redistribution of hydrocarbon flows, but for India economic feasibility always remains a priority. “We assume that Russia will retain its status as one of the main energy suppliers to the South Asian republic, with entrepreneurs being able to adjust to the existing format of interaction given the current situation.” On October 22, the US imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil — two of the largest oil producers in Russia — to cut off the Kremlin's resources for funding the Ukraine war. According to European think tank, India spent as much as 2.5 billion euro on purchases of crude oil from Moscow in October, and it was unchanged from the 2.5 billion euro spent on buying Russian oil in September.

In a notification on Thursday, Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the US State Department has approved the sale of $93 million worth of military equipment. This is the first time New Delhi has purchased defence equipment from Washington after US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50% as punishment for the country's purchases of Russian oil. According to the DSCA statement, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions. The agency added that the “proposed sale will improve India's capability to meet current and future threats by providing precision capability equipment, which will increase first strike accuracy in its brigades. India will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” The Javelin missile system is a modern anti-tank guided missile system that is used extensively across the world.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality.
