It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763507599.4931862}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Also Read | CAT 2025: How to progress by analysing mock test results Here’s that race plan— the same one I share with students facing CAT, XAT , and other high-stakes tests. When the timer starts, don’t dive in. Spend 120 seconds to see the terrain: question types, section spread, and obvious quick wins. Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean. Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains. If you can’t see a path in 30 seconds, tag it and move. Accuracy beats volume.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion.

As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI).

In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary.

When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763507618.2837868}

From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid.

Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Addressing this issue, IIT Madras CREST and YNOS have developed India’s only independent digital platform dedicated to startups. The platform already hosts over 2.75 lakh startups, 15,000 angel investors, 5,500 venture capital firms, 1,400 incubators, 800 banks, and 110 government support schemes, making it the country’s largest and most comprehensive startup database.

Nearly half of them believe their roles AI can make a switch in their jobs within the next three to five years. According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations. Among those worried that artificial intelligence could replace their roles, at least 40% are actively considering an exit.

Watching SpaceX build reusable rockets and develop space robotics sparked in me a dream to be part of such innovation. I wanted to be in a place where I could explore similar ideas and be surrounded by people who shared the same curiosity and drive. I first appeared for JEE Advanced right after Class 12 and managed a decent rank, but I wanted to improve. I decided to take a drop year and give it one more serious attempt. That decision changed my life — the following year, I secured admission into IIT Mandi. Preparing for JEE Main and JEE Advanced was not easy. During my drop year, I joined a coaching in Kota and studied nearly six to eight hours a day. I never enjoyed inorganic chemistry, but my biggest challenge wasn’t the syllabus – it was maintaining consistency under pressure. There were moments of burnout and self-doubt, but my parents and teachers encouraged me to push through. But now, when I look back, I feel it was all worth it. I am doing Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Mandi . My hometown is Bhind, Madhya Pradesh. I completed my schooling at a CBSE school. My father is a businessman, and my mother a homemaker — both have been my strongest support system. What I miss most about Bhind is the sense of belonging that only home can bring. When choosing a branch, I initially leaned toward Aerospace Engineering and Robotics. However, with my background in biology, I found Bioengineering fascinating because it connects biology, computation, and robotics – fields that can truly impact society. In JoSAA counselling, I also considered Aerospace and Electrical Engineering, but the thought of studying in a serene, hilly campus drew me to IIT Mandi.

Small mistakes in these final days can undo months of efforts – countless practice, revision on the loop, repeated mock attempts and performance analysis – all can go into vain. It happens with the best of the best. The following is the list of the most common mistakes aspirants make close to the CAT and how you can avoid them – walking into the exam with focus and confidence. In the final stretch, many aspirants fall into the “more mocks = more improvement” trap. This happens especially with the ones who start their preparation late. Many of the aspirants start writing a full-length mock every day or worse, trying to attempt two mocks a day. This process does more harm than good. This leads to a drop in accuracy (result of inadequate post mock analysis), fatigue build up and drop in confidence. Reduce mock frequency to 2-3 per week and focus on deep analysis. Ask yourself questions like: Which questions did I choose wrongly? Did I waste time on a trap set? Did I panic midway? You need to chase understanding rather than scores and focus on exam attempt strategy. In the process of trying to cover left over topics, strengthening certain topics, attempting more than required mocks – candidates often miss adequate revision. They keep taking tests without revising their basics – forgetting one small formula or concept mid-exam can cost valuable marks. Well, the right course is to create a formula/trick/revision book while you are covering the concepts. If that is not done, create one quickly. Spend 20-30 minutes, 3-4 days a week revisiting these notes and updating them. The goal isn’t to learn new things – it’s to make your brain recall old things (Formulas, patterns, logics) instantly. Aspirants need to understand that it is normal for mock scores to fluctuate. In the last 3-4 weeks, many students lose confidence because of this.

This is not only an administrative reform, but also justice for our children and fairness for our institutions,” Sood said. The minister added that nearly 500 schools are expected to come under the ambit of the Directorate of Education (DoE), which would ensure legitimacy, regulatory oversight and accountability. Each year, the Directorate receives around 2 lakh applications under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Disadvantaged Groups (DG), and Children With Special Needs (CWSN) categories for approximately 40,000 seats, many of which remain vacant due to the shortage of recognised schools. The new recognition policy is expected to create about 20,000 additional seats, expanding equitable access to education, the minister said.

Indians spent $50.25 million on education in Georgia in 2024-25, a nearly five-fold surge from $10.33 million in 2018-19, according to data on Reserve Bank of India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), obtained under the RTI Act. This rise, the LRS data shows, has come largely at Ukraine’s expense, with Indian remittances for education there dropping from $14.80 million in 2018-19 to just $2.40 million in 2024-25. In the years before the war, Indian remittances for education in Ukraine were rising. In fact, Ukraine was among the top 10 destinations for Indian students in 2020-21 and 2021-22, when remittances touched $39.12 million. This fell sharply to about $10.6 million in 2022-23, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The same year, 2022-23, Georgia entered the list of top 15 countries to which Indians sent money for education abroad — ranking 14th, a significant jump from its 21st position in 2018-19. The country has since moved up to the 12th place. According to data submitted in Parliament in December last year on the number of Indians who disclosed their purpose as ‘study/education’ while going abroad, there were 4,148 such Indians who went to Georgia in 2019. This number rose to 10,470 in 2023. According to Foreign education consultants, Georgia was already popular for medical and paramedical courses such as physiotherapy, but it gained substantially after the war began as students avoided Ukraine and those already enrolled in medical courses there sought transfers to universities in Georgia.

The findings of the report launched at Leadership Summit by BML Munjal University, reveal a generation that is not only ambitious but also eager to build responsible ventures anchored in transparency and trust. Nearly three-fourths of the students surveyed expressed a clear intention to start their own ventures, reflecting the growing mainstream appeal of entrepreneurship as a preferred career path. “A lack of mentorship is the most significant challenge, cited by 35 per cent of student respondents.

Instead, as Delangue sees it, it’s large language models (LLMs) — like those powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and other chatbots — that are receiving outsized attention, and that attention may not last. “I think we’re in an LLM bubble, and I think the LLM bubble might be bursting next year,” explained Delangue. “But ‘LLM’ is just a subset of AI when it comes to applying AI to biology, chemistry, image, audio, [and] video. I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years,” he noted. One issue, he argued, is that LLMs aren’t the right solution for everything, and smaller, more specialized models will see increased adoption in the future. “I think all the attention, all the focus, all the money, is concentrated into this idea that you can build one model through a bunch of compute and that is going to solve all problems for all companies and all people,” said Delangue. “I think the reality is that you’ll see in the next few months, next few years, kind of like a multiplicity of models that are more customized, specialized, that are going to solve different, different problems.” As an example, he suggested the use case of a banking customer chatbot. “You don’t need it to tell you about the meaning of life, right? You can use a smaller, more specialized model that is going to be cheaper, that is going to be faster, that maybe you’re going to be able to run on your infrastructure as an enterprise, and I think that is the future of AI,” Delangue pointed out.

The FTC did manage to surface evidence showing that Meta — then called Facebook — was concerned about Instagram’s fast growth and the competition it could pose. “One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying is time,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote in February 2012, per internal Facebook emails that surfaced during the trial. “Even if some new competitors springs [sic] up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare, etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.” But Judge Boasberg was not ruling on whether Meta had acted as a monopoly back then, but rather, if it is currently a monopoly. Boasberg pointed to apps like TikTok as evidence that Meta has competition. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote in his memorandum opinion. “While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.”  Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

The company announced on Monday that users worldwide will be able to start group chats with up to 200 other people, then collaborate across more than 200 AI models — including text, image, video, and audio generators — within a single conversation. The launch comes just days after OpenAI’s ChatGPT began piloting group chats in markets like Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. The move could potentially transform the chatbot from a one-on-one AI interaction into a collaborative space where users can also engage with friends, family, or colleagues. Quora says the addition of group chats to Poe could enable new types of interactive experiences for AI users. For instance, the company suggests that families or friends could use the feature to plan a trip together using Gemini 2.5’s search functionality and o3 Deep Research. Teams could also work together to brainstorm images for mood boards using the various image models on Poe, or groups could play trivia games together using one of the quiz bots on the app. The group chats will allow users to work together using any combination of AI models or creator-made bots, including models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet, ElevenLabs v3, ElevenLabs Music, Nano Banana, GPT-5.1, Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro, o3 Deep Research, Sora 2 Pro, and Veo 3.1, among others. Poe users can start a group chat from the app’s home screen on the website at poe.com. As you chat, the chat history will sync in real time across your devices, so you could start chatting on desktop and then move to a mobile device without losing the thread. Quora developed the feature over the past six months and plans to continue to improve group chats in the weeks following its launch, based on user feedback. “We think the space of potential group interactions mediated by AI and collaboration opportunities with AI is vast and currently under-explored,” the company ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/poes-ai-app-now-supports-group-chats-across-ai-models/", "timestamp": 1763507909.0330846}

The “LPs” who fund VCs are confronting an asset class in flux: Funds have nearly twice the lifespan they used to, emerging managers face life-or-death fundraising challenges, and billions of dollars sit trapped in startups that may never justify their 2021 valuations. Indeed, at a recent StrictlyVC panel in San Francisco, above the din of the boisterous crowd gathered to watch it, five prominent LPs, representing endowments, fund-of-funds, and secondaries firms managing over $100 billion combined, painted a surprising picture of venture capital’s current state, even as they see areas of opportunity emerging from the upheaval. Perhaps the most striking revelation was that venture funds are living far longer than anyone planned for, creating a raft of problems for institutional investors. “Conventional wisdom may have suggested 13-year-old funds,” said Adam Grosher, a director at the J. Paul Getty Trust, which manages $9.5 billion. “In our own portfolio, we have funds that are 15, 18, even 20 years old that still hold marquee assets, blue-chip assets that we would be happy to hold.” Still, the “asset class is just a lot more illiquid” than most might imagine based on the history of the industry, he said. This extended timeline is forcing LPs to rip up and rebuild their allocation models. Lara Banks of Makena Capital, which manages $6 billion in private equity and venture capital, noted her firm now models an 18-year fund life, with the majority of capital actually returning in years 16 through 18. Meanwhile, the J. Paul Getty Trust is actively revisiting how much capital to deploy, leaning toward more conservative allocations to avoid overexposure. The alternative is active portfolio management through secondaries, a market that has become essential infrastructure. “I think every LP and every GP should be actively engaging with the secondary market,” said Matt Hodan of Lexington Pa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/our-funds-are-20-years-old-a-look-inside-the-liquidity-crisis-reshaping-venture-capital/", "timestamp": 1763507909.1384404}

Launched in August , the productivity tool lets you block yourself from distracting phone apps while encouraging you with the aid of a virtual friend — a little cartoon bean that likes to knit socks and scarves, which can later be exchanged for décor for the little bean’s room. The premise behind the app is that users might be encouraged to manage their screen time better if they know their actions would impact others, even if it’s just a little bean that would be sad if you interrupted their knitting project. The app was a hit at launch, reaching No. 1 on Apple’s App Store after rapidly climbing the charts . On Android, Focus Friend has north of 1 million installs, according to its Play Store listing . Google calls Focus Friend a helpful and cute app and an effective tool for helping users disconnect. In a year that again saw AI assistants and tools climb the app store charts over and over again, it’s interesting to see a timer that helps you disconnect from your tech winning Google’s highest app award. On Google Play, for instance, the top apps currently include both of OpenAI’s consumer-facing tools: ChatGPT (at No. 1), and video app Sora. Other top apps focus on social media, entertainment, or shopping, like TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, Temu, and GoWish.

Coming just seven months after the Gemini 2.5 release , the new model is Google’s most capable LLM yet, and an immediate contender for the most capable AI tool on the market. The release also comes less than a week after OpenAI released GPT 5.1, and a mere two months after Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 — a reminder of the blistering pace of frontier model development. A more research-intensive version of the model, called Gemini 3 Deepthink, will also be made available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks, once it passes further rounds of safety testing. “With Gemini 3, we’re seeing this massive jump in reasoning,” said Tulsee Doshi, Google’s head of product for the Gemini model. “It’s responding with a level of depth and nuance that we haven’t seen before.” Some of that reasoning power is already registering on independent benchmarks. With a score of 37.4, the model marked the highest score on record on the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark , meant to capture general reasoning and expertise. The previous high score, held by GPT-5 Pro, was 31.64. Gemini 3 also topped the leaderboard on LMArena, a human-led benchmark that measures user satisfaction. According to Google, the Gemini app currently has more than 650 million monthly active users, and 13 million software developers have used the model as part of their workflow. Alongside the base model, Google also released a Gemini-powered coding interface called Google Antigravity , allowing for multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0.

The social network says the feature lets users chat about what’s happening in the world and across various communities, from Formula 1 to the reality TV show “Below Deck.” Profiles will remain private to anyone you’re not friends with, helping prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages, Snapchat says. While a user’s display name will be visible next to their message, others won’t be able to tap through to their profile from a Topic Chat, the company told TechCrunch in an email. And unlike usernames, display names can’t be used to search for someone. Snapchat told TechCrunch that it will use LLM technology and other safety measures to moderate Topic Chats to keep them safe and appropriate. Additionally, messages must adhere to Snapchat’s Community Guidelines, and users can report inappropriate messages. The company says it will take action against users who violate its policies, including warning users and blocking accounts. Users will be able to see which Topic Chats their friends have joined, which the company says will make it easier for people to find common interests with others. In addition to messages, Topic Chats will also surface related Spotlight videos, which are the app’s TikTok-like short-form videos. Up until now, the only place for public conversations on Snapchat was in Spotlight comments. Snapchat says it was inspired to launch Topic Chats after seeing how its community interacts in public comments, as it wanted to give users a new way to have these conversations. “Snapchatters create billions of Snaps every day, sharing moments with friends and family, and as we’ve expanded services like Spotlight, we’ve also found that the Snapchat community loves commenting publicly about trending topics and events,” the company wrote in a blog post .

When someone takes a trip, Boop uses AI to quickly turn their trip into an itinerary that others can copy and personalize, mainly by looking at location data and metadata from photos they share with the app. The idea is to build a network of shared itineraries that people can monetize, giving travel creators another way to earn money from their recommendations. The startup was founded in February by Nancy Li Smith, who previously led AR/VR innovation at Meta and Microsoft and served as executive vice president of growth and strategy at physical AI startup BrightAI. Smith came up with the idea for Boop after feeling like there wasn’t a way for her to remember or share her own travel recommendations efficiently.

All these years of the emotional and logistical labor for free. Boop is now solving this so that we can capture this easily without people doing anything.” Instead of having to scour TikTok for recommendations, sift through hundreds of reviews, and pin ideas across Google Maps, users can access tested and loved itineraries from creators and friends. “Boop is the first AI travel companion that’s built on social trust,” Smith said. “What that means is, the moment you start going on", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/boops-new-app-turns-social-recommendations-into-bookable-itineraries/", "timestamp": 1763507910.0747588}

Zoox robotaxis — custom-built vehicles that lack a steering wheel or pedals — have been rolling around San Francisco streets for nearly a year . But until now, only Zoox employees and their friends and family have been able to hail a ride. This is not a large-scale public launch, nor a commercial one. Instead, the company will invite some of the people who signed up for the waitlist to join its early rider initiative known as Zoox Explorer. Under that program, those select few will get access to the service and, for now, it’s free. Riders will slowly be moved off the waitlist as Zoox adds more robotaxis to its fleet and its service area grows. Zoox said its goal is to remove the waitlist altogether in 2026. The company wouldn’t disclose the number of riders that will be given public access or how many are on the waitlist. Today, it has about 50 robotaxis in Las Vegas and San Francisco. Once given access, riders will be able to use the Zoox app to hail a ride within its service area, which covers the SoMa, Mission, and Design District neighborhoods of San Francisco. While Zoox’s service area is tiny compared to the 260 square miles that Waymo’s robotaxis operate in, the public launch does get it closer to directly competing with the Alphabet-owned company. Zoox, which was acquired by Amazon in 2020, has been working toward a commercial robotaxi service for more than a decade. Its test vehicles, Toyota Highlanders outfitted with sensors and self-driving software, were a common sight in the San Francisco Bay Area for years. But it’s the Foster City, California-based company’s purpose-built robotaxis that have captured the public’s attention. “Zoox has been testing our autonomous technology in San Francisco since 2017,” CEO Aicha Evans said in a statement. “It’s our home.

The world, and especially Hallmark movies, is full of holiday disaster stories: burnt turkeys, failed desserts, steamed hams . But I'm not bragging when I say that the first Thanksgiving dinner I prepared for my extended family—a little early, this year—was an unmitigated success. My aunt couldn't stop talking about the black pepper in the biscuits and the sage on the carrots. My uncle went in for the turkey and the apple-sausage stuffing. My father didn't speak at all, unless prompted. He just ate and ate. This was a compliment. But of course, I had cheated. I had ordered my Thanksgiving in the mail—one of the new breed of Thanksgiving meal kits. The meal was genuinely home-cooked, of course, prepared mostly from scratch. But the entire seven-platter feast—its ingredients and recipes—had arrived two days before, in a box large enough to house a primal cut of beef. It was Thanksgiving in a box: a $200 “Chef's Table Thanksgiving” meal kit available from sister meal delivery plans Sunbasket and Gobble . The spread from Sunbasket was vast and generous. The table contained a nearly 3-pound roast of turkey, mounds of mashed potato, pebbled cranberry compote, roasted carrots dressed in miso-sage butter, brussels sprouts dappled with pecorino romano and pancetta, an endless platter of fennel-apple-sausage-stuffing, Gruyère black-pepper biscuits caked more than an inch tall, a tureen of deep brown turkey gravy, a ginger apple crisp waiting in the wings. Sunbasket is among a new bounty of meal kit companies that aim to ease the stress of the holidays by doing the planning and the shopping for you—big meal boxes tailor-made for those who still want to make a home-cooked meal but for whom the prospect of planning a vast and complicated feast is prohibitive.

That's quite the deal on a product that doesn't often see major discounts, and you can use that gift card to accessorize your new headset. Meta Best Buy (Walking Dead Bundle) Amazon Walmart Meta Meta's lineup of stand-alone headsets has slowly improved over the last few years, with frequent updates adding functionality and growing the library of games. You don't need a computer or console to power them, which makes it easy to just toss the headset on and start playing without any extra steps. With object and hand tracking, sometimes you don't even need controllers, and the pass-through camera lets you blend the real world and the virtual one for awesome mixed reality experiences. While the Quest 3S is the more budget-friendly offering in the current generation of headsets, the compromises aren't as major as you might be thinking. The screen is slightly lower resolution, and the pass-through isn't quite as sharp, but otherwise the Quest 3S plays the same games and experiences as the more expensive Quest 3 . Both headsets suffer from limited battery life, so don't expect more than a couple of hours of play at a time. I haven't had a chance to play the included game, Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, but it's described as a survival action game set in a zombie-ridden version of New Orleans. You'll have to make tough decisions about how to deal with other survivors, and it looks like there are plenty of opportunities to slay zombies.

Not only are these an innovative way to get chronic snoozers out of bed, but they can be great for those who are hard of hearing, utilizing different frequencies and pitches as well as movement through vibration. I’m a very heavy sleeper, so I tried one of these nontraditional extreme alarm clocks every day for a full week (at least). I chose the extreme alarms that were the most rated or reviewed online, found most often on online retailers like Amazon and in the app store, and tried to get a versatile range of options that focused on different areas, whether it be sound or activity.

As talk of an AI bubble grows, the company is keen to stress that its latest release is more than just a clever model and chatbot—it’s a way of improving Google’s existing products, including its lucrative search business, starting today. “We are the engine room of Google, and we're plugging in AI everywhere now,” Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind, an AI-focused subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told WIRED in an interview ahead of the announcement. Hassabis admits that the AI market appears inflated, with a number of unproven startups receiving multibillion-dollar valuations. Google and other AI firms are also investing billions in building out new data centers to train and run AI models, sparking fears of a potential crash. But even if the AI bubble bursts, Hassabis thinks Google is insulated. The company is already using AI to enhance products like Google Maps, Gmail, and Search. “In the downside scenario, we will lean more on that,” Hassabis says. “In the upside scenario, I think we've got the broadest portfolio and the most pioneering research.” Google is also using AI to build popular new tools like NotebookLM , which can auto-generate podcasts from written materials, and AI Studio which can prototype applications with AI. It’s even exploring embedding the technology into areas like gaming and robotics, which Hassabis says could pay huge dividends in years to come, regardless of what happens in the wider market. Google is making Gemini 3 available today through the Gemini app and in AI Overviews , a Google Search feature that synthesizes information alongside regular search results.

Agent 365 is not a platform for making enterprise AI tools; it’s a way to manage them, as if they were human employees . Companies using generative AI agents in their digital workplace can use Agent 365 to organize their growing sprawl of bots, keep tabs on how they’re performing, and tweak their settings. The tool is rolling out today in Microsoft’s early access program. Essentially, Microsoft created a trackable workspace for agents . “Tools that you use to manage people, devices, and applications today, you'd want to extend them to run agents as well in the future,” says Charles Lamanna, a president of business and industry for Microsoft’s Copilot , its AI chatbot. Lamanna envisions a future where companies have many more agents performing labor than humans. For example, if a company has 100,000 employees, he sees them as using “half a million to a million agents,” ranging in tasks from simple email organization to running the “whole procurement process” for a business. He claims Microsoft internally uses millions of agents. This army of bots, with permission to take actions inside a company’s software and automate aspects of an employee’s workflow, could quickly grow unwieldy to track. A lack of clear oversight could also open businesses up to security breaches . Agent 365 is a way to manage all your bots, whether those agents were built with Microsoft’s tools or through a third-party platform. Agent 365’s core feature is a registry of an organization’s active agents all in one place, featuring specific identification numbers for each and details about how they are being used by employees. It’s also where you can change the settings for agents and what aspects of a business’s software each one has permission to access.

Here's what that means: The number 8 refers to the magnification power . Objects seen through these binoculars will be eight times bigger than when you look with your naked eye. Newcomers should stick with 6X or 8X. They have enough power that you'll see things clearly, but they don't magnify so much that you'll struggle to find what you want to see or have trouble following fast-moving objects (though all binoculars take some practice). The 42 refers to the size of the front lens in millimeters . The larger the front lens (also called the objective lens), the more light reaches your eye. That means the image will be bigger, brighter, and clearer. A pair of 8x42 binoculars should be significantly brighter and offer a better viewing experience than a pair of 8x32 binoculars, even though both provide the same magnification. But the larger you get, the more glass they will use—so they'll weigh more. The weight difference between an 8x32 pair and a 10x42 pair is significant if you're wearing them all day.

The machine has taken up a task I consider sacred: making me a cocktail. In advance of holiday party season, I have been testing a pair of devices that promise an indulgent future, a life where machines can make you a passable Old Fashioned. The best-known cocktail machine on the market is almost certainly the Bartesian, the easy-peasy Keurig of cocktail makers. The circular device on my table is the Barsys 360, a Day-Glo device with a bit more flair for the dramatic. Right now the Barsys is making me an Oaxaca Old Fashioned, but it could have been any of literally 2,000 other drinks, if I only had the ingredients. Among “Oaxaca” drinks alone we potentially also have a “Flower,” a “Gold,” and a “Tail.” The Barsys promises nearly 50 takes on Old Fashioned, and more than 70 versions of the mule. (A third cocktail machine option, the Bev by Black + Decker , uses Bartesian’s capsules with a different device design. It is likely being discontinued according to reps, but is still available on Amazon .) It’s all very ridiculous, my friends assure me, when I send them videos of the Barsys aggressively spitting ingredients into a glass whose magnetic bottom spins the liquid inside into an icy, frothy whirlpool. “I am embarrassed to be watching this,” wrote my editor at WIRED. “That is so dumb,” echoed a friend, before adding, “You should definitely bring it over.” No one really needs a machine to make a decent cocktail, of course. But you might want one anyway. I have a theory, the kind of big idea you hear sometimes in small bars. The promise of an automatic cocktail machine is not ease, nor necessity, nor even usefulness.

Of course, you may also have read that I’m really sick of being asked about AI . I’m still not sick, though, of asking other people about it—especially when they’re much smarter about this stuff than I am. Enter Joe Weisenthal, the cohost of Bloomberg’s fantastic Odd Lots podcast, and a former coworker of mine. Trust me: As someone who spent a year listening to Joe lose his mind in the office—loudly!—anytime the economy hiccuped, few people think more about our country’s, and our planet’s, financial circumstances than Joe does. And right now, Joe’s concerns aren’t strictly about what happens if or when that AI bubble bursts. His worries are more focused on what’s going right and wrong with the US economy writ large.

It’s not just a dual-ended vibrator , offering up G-spot stimulation on one end and clitoral stimulation on the other, but it also features something you don’t see every day: a pussy pump . It's not the friendliest-looking sex toy. Unlike traditional vibrators that can be easily categorized as wands or rabbits, the suction cup and the flicking tongue make it look like nothing else that came before. But who cares if it looks like a probe from a sci-fi flick—does it do the job? First up: the vibrating dildo. It’s here you’ll find five extremely powerful vibration intensities packed into the textured shaft, ideal for G-spot or P-spot stimulation. Because this part of the toy also doubles as an ergonomic handle, it has some weight to it and is more girthy than many internal vibrators. That allows the G-spot stimulator to cover more area, making those rumbles feel more intense than they normally would. I typically like stronger vibrations, but I didn’t feel the need to turn things up past the third level on the Lick to find the sweet spot. Le Wand Lick 3-in-1 Rechargeable Double-Ended Vibrator Rating: 8/10 When you flip the Lick around, things look more complicated—especially if you’re new to suction play—but if you take your time to understand these features, you’ll be a happy camper. On this end, you have a suction cup and a tongue-shaped clitoral stimulator. Remove the cup—just a quick twist and it’s off—you can easily access the flicking tongue. The tongue has three speeds that, with a bit of water-based lube , are meant to mimic the sensation of oral sex. It didn’t feel much like oral sex to me, which probably says more about my partners than the Lick, but it felt great against my clitoris. So much so that this was my favorite function of the Lick.

Apple TV has The Morning Show . When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) to revamp the show.

I should know—I've been straightening my 3a curly hair since the George H.W. Bush administration, and over the past year I've tried just about every style and brand of flat iron or straightening implement. Needless to say, I've learned a few things. First off, hair straighteners are somewhat subjective. People have different hair, and types of hair, and ideas of what they'd like their hair to look like. A high-heat titanium iron might be a godsend for someone with 4b coily hair, but could destroy another person's fine, 2a wavy hair.

It's proven for longevity (former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has had hers since college), it's got ceramic plates that are safe even for fine hair and beginners, and the wide plates have enough power for hard-to-straighten hair but aren't so wide they inhibit maneuverability.

Commander Chen Dong, concluding his third trip to space, and rookie crewmates Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie touched down inside their spacecraft at the Dongfeng landing zone at 1:29 am EST (06:29 UTC) Friday. The parachute-assisted landing occurred in the mid-afternoon at the return zone, located in the remote Gobi Desert of northwestern China. Chinese space officials upended operations on the country’s Tiangong space lab last week after astronauts found damage to one of two Shenzhou return capsules docked at the station. The China Manned Space Agency, run by the country’s military, announced changes to the space station’s flight plan November 4, the day before three crew members were supposed to depart and fly home. Chen and his crewmates were preparing to board the Shenzhou 20 spacecraft for the ride back to Earth a few days after the arrival of three replacement crew members on the newly launched Shenzhou 21 capsule. Shenzhou 20 is the same spacecraft that launched Chen’s crew in April. But a little more than a week ago, Chinese officials said the Shenzhou 20 spacecraft was “suspected of being impacted by small space debris” and confirmed the return trip would be postponed. Officials provided no additional details. China’s human spaceflight agency released a cryptic statement earlier this week saying preparations were underway for the crew’s undocking and landing, but the circumstances of the return remained opaque until hours before the astronauts’ homecoming. Finally, officials confirmed the details of the return to Earth late Thursday. “Based on preliminary analysis of photographs, design review, simulation analysis, and wind tunnel tests, a comprehensive assessment determined that the Shenzhou 20 manned spacecraft’s return capsule window glass had developed a minor cra", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/three-astronauts-are-stuck-on-chinas-space-station-without-a-safe-ride-home/", "timestamp": 1763507915.1013641}

Amazon Bookshop.org by Stephen Witt Charting Nvidia’s rise to become one of the most valuable companies on earth, this biography of cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang is educational and entertaining. Witt explains how the company spun GPU (graphics processing unit) manufacturing for gaming into parallel processing and a marriage of hardware and software that has powered the rise of AI. It has also made Huang very rich, but he isn’t always painted in a flattering light, which helps to counterbalance the founder worship vibe.

Maybe it’s a fuzzy blanket that nothing comes close to replicating, or a limited-edition, circa-2008 bedazzled iPod Shuffle. As priceless as these things feel, they’re not infallible. You’ve got about two to three years, give or take, before your beloved bed sheets and feather pillows are going to give up the ghost and need replacing . Electronics are also complicated to dispose of, given that batteries can’t be thrown in the trash , yet you want to free up some storage space. When their time is up, you must—in the most literal sense—lay them to rest. I take the mantra of “reuse, reduce, and recycle” very seriously, and will eke out as much extra mileage as I can by cutting up old sheets and towels to use as cleaning rags, or turning a ratty old pillow into a makeshift dog bed. Recycling programs near me don’t accept textiles, so eventually I have to toss them into the trash, knowing they're headed to a landfill. The numbers on textile waste are astounding. In 2017, the UN Environment Programme reported that 92 million metric tons of textile waste were generated globally each year, with the US accounting for 17 million metric tons, according to another 2017 statistic by the Environmental Protection Agency . It feels pretty bleak. However, thanks to a targeted social media ad, I found a textile-recycling subscription service that's the answer I’ve been looking for: Trashie . Purchase a “Take Back Bag” for $20 and you can send in clean, used clothing, bedsheets, shoes, and even old Halloween costumes. The bags come in packs of one or three. There is also the “Take Back Tech Box” for $25, where you can send back old electronics that have been collecting dust in a drawer.

Faceless, shrouded in black with red eyes and a top hat, it ominously lurks in the corner. The Benadryl Hat Man is a shared and recurring hallucination that people report witnessing when taking dozens of the antihistamine at a time. The figure, depicted in Halloween costumes , POV-Benadryl trip memes , and Walmart graphic tees , has become the symbol for a new drug trend that sees young people deliberately taking large doses of the drug, not to ward off allergies, but to get high. John, a 21-year-old college student who used to trip on Benadryl, never saw the Hat Man. Yet, he says, “I could see how that could happen. It's [Benadryl] digging in the depths of your brain to find whatever's making you scared. So, if you're scared of the Hat Man, I'm sure you're going to see the Hat Man.” This searching for the unpleasant to reveal itself, while sounding horrible, is, in fact, the purpose of recreational Benadryl use. (John does not want his real name used due to fear of friends finding out.) When used in high doses, diphenhydramine, an ingredient in Benadryl, functions as a deliriant, a hallucinogenic class of drugs, which appear to be becoming increasingly popular among young people for nonmedical purposes. Unlike psychedelics or other hallucinogens, there’s no real potential for a good trip on a deliriant. According to the people I spoke to, every trip is bad, every trip is brutal, and that’s the point. In 2020, the “Benadryl challenge ” gained traction on TikTok, daring participants to take doses of at least 12 Benadryl pills for an intense trip. The trend, which resurfaces every few years, drew attention to the psychoactive effects of deliriants. “I saw a video about it on TikTok once, so I knew it could be used recreationally,” one user tells me.

I remember vividly my mom using baby powder in the 1980s, as well as my first purchase of drugstore dry shampoo in the early 2000s. It went on like spray paint and probably contained enough chemicals to poison a small animal, but it did the job of letting me skip a couple days of my arduous wash, dry, and straighten routine . This break was good for my sanity as well as my hair. Come 2022, commercially produced dry shampoo received its first major black eye when companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever conducted a voluntary recall of their dry shampoos for potentially elevated levels of benzene . Familiar drugstore brands like Dove, Nexxus, and Suave were suddenly seen as being a cancer risk, which raised the question with dry shampoos in general: What is actually in this stuff? Thankfully, since the recall most companies have taken to testing their products for benzene and other harmful chemicals. Third-party testing is hard to come by, but the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG) is independently funded and has a Skin Deep database tool for consumers to parse what harmful ingredients might be lurking in their cosmetics and personal care products.

There’s Sam Altman, chief executive of the whole company, who manages research and compute. And as of this summer, there’s Fidji Simo, the former CEO of Instacart, who manages everything else. Simo hasn’t been seen much at OpenAI’s San Francisco office since she began as CEO of Applications in August. But her presence is felt at every level of the company—not least because she’s heading up ChatGPT and basically every function that might make OpenAI money. Simo is dealing with a relapse of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) that makes her prone to fainting if she stands for long periods of time. So for now, she’s working from home in Los Angeles, and she’s on Slack. A lot. “Being present from 8 am to midnight every day, responding within five minutes, people feel like I’m there and that they can reach me immediately, that I jump on the phone within five minutes,” she tells me. Employees confirm that this is true. OpenAI’s famously Slack-driven culture can be overwhelming for new hires. But not, apparently, for Simo. Employees say she is often seen popping into channels and threads, sharing thoughts and asking questions. Simo joined during a chaotic period for OpenAI, which is expanding in nearly every direction. There are sovereign AI partnerships, new model releases, retail partnerships, multibillion-dollar compute deals , a proprietary chip, a mysterious hardware product—and of course, ChatGPT. “We do not battle for scope,” Simo says. “We battle for less scope.” Outside Silicon Valley, Simo’s hiring came as a surprise. For those in the know, it was less of a shock. A native of Sète, a small fishing town in the south of France, Simo made a name for herself running the Facebook app at Meta before taking the top job at Instacart in 2021.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person. When Halliburton arrived at the Rosewood Hotel, he found Even and Maxim perched in a booth. They struck him as playboy, high-roller types—particularly Maxim, who wore a tan three-piece suit and had a highly manicured look, his long dark hair parted down the middle. A Rolex protruded from the cuff of his sleeve. Over a three-course lunch—ceviche with a roe garnish, Chilean sea bass, and cherry cake—they discussed the contours of the deal and traded details about their respective backgrounds. Even was talkative and jocular, telling stories about blowout parties in Marrakech. Maxim was aloof; he mostly stared at Halliburton, holding his gaze for long periods at a time as though sizing him up. As a relationship-building exercise, Even proposed that Halliburton sell the family office around $3,000 in bitcoin. Halliburton was initially hesitant, but chalked it up as a peculiar dating ritual.

Moving into soundbars might seem like a natural succession, but creating an all-in-one distributor of surround sound and spatial audio formats that sits neatly beneath your TV is not without its challenges.

It's capable of a premium touch and immersive overhead and side-firing effects. But when it comes to cinematic punch in action scenes and impactful moments, something is holding it back. In other words, this soundbar just doesn’t rock. It’s nearly impossible not to admire the Heston 120’s style. My wife—who has endured more soundbar unboxings than any audio civilian should have to—was immediately impressed by its striking design.

KiwiCo KiwiCo We subscribed to Kiwi Crate's monthly subscription for so long that the company sent us a cautious email asking whether it was OK that we were getting repeat boxes. I now check in every year to discover that yes, the company's boxes are still amazing. Each box comes with a single, delightful, themed activity that's appropriate for a kid aged anywhere from a few months old to 18 years. A recent Delivery Bot ($24) aimed for 9+ years entertained my 8-year-old son for an afternoon. I can't extoll the virtues of this crate enough.

It ranks on just about every list of the best VPNs (including our own), and it’s obvious to anyone with an internet connection and vague interest in tech just how aggressive NordVPN’s marketing strategy is. It has a high bar to live up to, and thankfully, it does. Even in the face of a public hack and PR disaster in 2019, not to mention the massive target on its back given how prominent NordVPN is, the core service is still excellent. The speeds can go toe-to-toe with the best VPNs on the market, and Nord’s privacy and security practices have been tested and proven effective, even against the company’s will. Further, it has largely led the market on large feature packages alongside its VPN service, which we’ve seen mimicked by competitors like ExpressVPN. NordVPN still stands tall today, and despite being a little more expensive than I’d like, it feels worth the price. NordVPN has slowly built up multiple plans at varying prices, each unlocking a new set of features. It doesn’t offer a free plan, which is a shame in the face of options like Proton VPN and Nord’s own free NordPass password manager. You’ll need to pay to get your foot in the door. NordVPN Plus Rating: 8/10 NordVPN’s Basic plan is on the expensive side, and as the name suggests, it doesn’t come with many extras. You get the VPN, 10 simultaneous connections, and Nord’s DNS servers to help combat ads. However, you don’t get Threat Protection Pro, which includes more sophisticated ad blocking, as well as malware/scam protection in your browser. For that, you’ll need to upgrade to the Plus plan, which not only includes Threat Protection Pro but also the paid version of NordPass, which is a big upgrade. NordVPN’s Basic plan is more expensive than Mullvad and Windscribe, but the Plus plan is more in line with the rest of the market. Compared to Proton, for example, it is an extra $1 per month on the monthly plan.

Here’s how I cut down my family’s reliance on Alexa.", "content": "Until recently, my smart home setup was in chaos. After years of testing, buying, and upgrading to the latest smart home gadgets in an attempt to make my life easier, it became a bloated mess that was actually making it more complicated. My Alexa , Google Home, and Apple Home apps were awash with dead devices, duplicates, and automations that simply didn’t work. My Hue Bridge, trying desperately to tie it all together, was creaking at the seams. And the more advanced platforms I hadn't quite committed to, such as Homey and SmartThings, were fighting each other for bandwidth on an already congested network. I was basically employed as full-time tech support in my own house, just to stop the kids moaning that their lights weren’t working … again. It was time for a reset—a chance to embark on a total rethink of what a comprehensive smart home in 2025 should look like. If that sounds daunting, it needn't be. Here's how I gave my smart home a much-needed reboot and brought harmony to my house once more. A lot of people reading this probably walked the same path I did, of adding devices to Alexa early on because it was easy, then losing control as the smart home boom outpaced the platform that was meant to keep everything in sync. This meant I ended up running a network of prosumer-grade smart home products on an operating system that, let’s face it, was designed to add dishwasher tablets to a shopping list and remind the kids to brush their teeth. It's not ever really been cut out to manage low-latency state changes across a hundred different devices. Alexa has got better for moderate smart home users though, with Amazon adding things like Zigbee radios, Matter controller and Thread Border Router features to the mix in recent years—all of which give it a bit more flexibility. But it is still more of a great digital assistant than dedicated smart home system, and anyone looking to build something serious should look elsewhere. I had already started porting some stuff over", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/heres-how-i-ditched-alexa-and-upgraded-my-smart-home/", "timestamp": 1763507917.7036674}

Another 24% said neither party succeeded. The poll recontacted respondents who had participated in an early-November survey conducted during the shutdown . While the shutdown has ended , Democratic voters are more likely to feel frustrated about the resolution, with 55% saying their party compromised too much. In contrast, 70% of Republicans felt their delegation struck the right balance in negotiations . Many Democrats now acknowledge that Republicans achieved more than their party, and some independents also lean toward this view. Despite the end of the shutdown, disapproval of how both parties handled the crisis remains high. 60% of Americans disapprove of Democrats’ approach, compared with 54% for congressional Republicans, and 56% disapprove of Trump’s leadership during the negotiations. The 43-day shutdown ended after eight Senate Democrats agreed to fund the government, voting with Republicans to pass the measure. Democrats compromised on health care-related demands in exchange for a promise of a future vote on extending Obamacare subsidies, which help millions afford health care. However, House Speaker Mike Johnson did not commit to a similar vote, leaving the proposal’s future uncertain. The poll surveyed 1,288 adults nationwide, with a margin of error of ±3.3 points.

The Labor Department only published the so-called continuing claims data for the weeks ending October 11 and 18. The government would have surveyed businesses and households for October's employment report during the week ending October 18.

No official weekly claims data had been published since late September because of the recently ended 43-day shutdown of the government. Separately, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said it would publish September's producer price report next Tuesday and the import and export price data on December 3. The White House has warned the unemployment rate for October will likely not be published after the longest shutdown in history prevented the collection of data from households. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.957 million during the week ended October 18, the data showed.

The Kremlin said that Russia would not be sending anyone to Turkey, and it was not immediately clear if there would be U.S. participation in the talks. Zelenskyy told a news conference in Spain that he would meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss “a just peace for Ukraine.” Zelenskyy’s statement came as Ukraine’s military said it had again used American-supplied ATACMS missiles to attack targets inside Russia, although it did not provide further details. Kyiv says that the use of longer-range missiles is vital in preventing strikes against Ukrainian cities, while the Kremlin has warned that the use of American weapons to strike targets inside its territory risks greater pressure on Russian-U.S. relations. A senior Turkish official told The Associated Press that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff would join Zelenskyy in Turkey, but backtracked later in the day and said Witkoff wouldn’t be coming. Zelenskyy did not confirm whether U.S. representatives would also take part. “We see some positions and signals from the United States,” he said. \"Well, let’s see tomorrow.” Three U.S. officials said they were not aware of any imminent overseas travel by Witkoff, though they acknowledged he is not a government employee and sometimes travels without U.S. government support.

Lawmakers this week released emails in which Epstein suggested Trump knew about his activities, prompting renewed questions about the President’s stance. On Tuesday, an ABC reporter asked Trump why—if he now supports releasing the files—he has not ordered his administration to do so directly. Trump rejected any connection to Epstein, repeating a claim he has made publicly in recent years. “As far as the Epstein files is, I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,” Trump said. “I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert.

But Prince Mohammed has taken charge of the day-to-day governing for his father, King Salman, 89, who has endured health problems in recent years. The President hosted the Saudi de facto ruler seeking to deepen ties with Washington and further rehabilitate his global image after the 2018 killing of US-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi . Khashoggi will likely be an afterthought as the two leaders unveil billions of dollars in deals and huddle with aides to discuss the tricky path ahead in a volatile Middle East, reported AP. US intelligence concluded that bin Salman approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. However, Prince Mohammed, for his part, denies involvement in the killing of Khashoggi, a Saudi citizen and Virginia resident.

The first jab in the recent campaign occurred after the White House social media channels shared a post describing the President and First Lady Melania Trump as “America’s power couple.” Melania Trump was making a rare appearance to unveil a new initiative focused on children in foster care when the original photo was shared. Newsom’s team swiftly replied to the post by sharing a still image from archived 1992 footage, showing Donald Trump alongside Jeffrey Epstein. The team followed up the next day, mocking the White House’s attempt at public relations with a pointed quote: “The internet knows who the real power couple is.”  This immediate and direct reference to Epstein and the nature of Trump’s association served to instantly redirect the public conversation away from the First Lady’s initiative and onto the President’s historical connections. The second swipe from Newsom’s team occurred following a post by the “Trump War Room” account.

The reason? He said the brand Swim Shady has a name too similar to his trademarked rap pseudonym Slim Shady, creating a ‘false association’ with the singer. The US rapper – in September – filed a petition to the US Patent and Trademark Office, calling for it to cancel a trademark that was granted to the Sydney-based company, mentioned a report by BBC. Going by the US law, the Australian brand is required to respond to the petition by next week. The 53-year-old rapper’s legal team has argued that Swim Shady creates a “false association” with Eminem, whose Slim Shady persona has been globally recognised for decades. The company, however, told the BBC it plans to “defend our valuable intellectual property”. In a statement to BBC, Swim Shady said it would “defend” their \"valuable intellectual property\". The Australian company further claimed that Swim Shady is a grassroots Australian company “born out of a desire to produce stylish and effective sun shades and other items to protect from the harsh Australian sun.” According to Australia’s business regulator, Swim Shady originally launched as Slim Shade before officially rebranding and debuting as Swim Shady in 2024. It sells portable beach umbrellas, swim bags and other accessories — and earlier this year, it secured a US trademark for the name. Eminem quickly moved to challenge it in both the US and Australia. Court records show Eminem trademarked Slim Shady in the US back in 1999, around the release of the album that cemented his fame. He, however, only applied for the trademark in Australia in January 2025. Eminem became a global sensation in 2000 with his single hit ‘The Real Slim Shady’, which earned him a Grammy and made the name synonymous with his career.

The resolution notes the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks that “led to the deaths of 166 individuals, including citizens from both India and the United States” as well as the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 26 civilians and injured dozens more and for which The Resistance Front (a proxy of Lashkar-e-Taiba), claimed responsibility. Introduced on Monday, 17 November – the resolution underscores decades of deepening cooperation between two of the world’s largest democracies across critical sectors, including defence, technology, trade, counterterrorism and education. It also highlights India’s vital role in promoting regional stability, economic growth and a free and open Indo-Pacific. “For more than three decades, it has been the policy of the United States under the administrations of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden to strengthen the strategic partnership with India, recognising its importance to regional stability, democratic governance, economic growth and shared regional priorities,” it said. The measure calls for continued cooperation between the US and India to confront 21st-century challenges — from counterterrorism and cyber threats to emerging technologies. It also recognises the enduring people-to-people ties between the two nations, which continue to be strengthened by the Indian American diaspora.

Under the new policy, Railways will charge a flat rate of ₹ 0.90 per tonne per kilometre when the commodity is moved in special tank containers developed by Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor). Additionally, the national transporter will build bulk cement handling terminals across the country through public-private partnerships to facilitate the rapid and cost-efficient movement of the commodity from production centres to consumers. Railways may repurpose poorly patronized assets, such as goods sheds (handling not more than 12 rakes in the preceding 12 months), loop lines, and others, for redevelopment if a potential bidder proposes to transform them into a Gati Shakti Cargo Terminal (GCT) for cement. The locations for such bulk terminals will be identified in consultation with cement manufacturers. Gati Shakti Cargo Terminals are a government initiative to develop new and modernize existing rail cargo terminals across the country, aimed at boosting logistics efficiency and multimodal connectivity. “The policy is a game-changer that will aid Railways in increasing its share in the multi-modal transport of key commodities. Cement is the first commodity to be included under this focused logistics solution by the transporter. More industries will be identified by Railways for reforms and focused policy measures,” Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said on Tuesday while announcing the new policy. The development of bulk cement handling terminals, along with the shift from an earlier, complex haulage rate structure to a system based on actual tonnage—removing distance and weight slabs—fulfils the industry’s expectations, according to experts. \"Most bulk cement movement involves shorter leads, with transport distances of less than 300km, where earlie", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indian-railways-new-policy-bulk-cement-transport-flat-freight-gati-shakti-terminals-11763464159235.html", "timestamp": 1763507961.7005937}

Summers, a current Harvard University Professor, stated that while he will \"continu[e] to fulfill my teaching obligations,\" the withdrawal from public roles is \"one part of my broader effort to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me.\" In his public statement to the media, Summers expressed deep remorse over his communication with Epstein. He used strong language to convey his regret: \"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused.\" \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein.\" The correspondence was made public by US lawmakers—specifically, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform—who released over 20,000 documents from Epstein’s estate last week. The documents revealed that Summers and Epstein continued to exchange messages until July 5, 2019—just one day before Epstein’s arrest on new sex-trafficking charges. Epstein later died by suicide in prison in August 2019. The exchanges included discussions on topics such as President Donald Trump . Despite stepping back from public commitments, Summers confirmed he will maintain his primary roles at Harvard. He holds Harvard’s highest faculty distinction as a University Professor and serves as the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, a position he will continue to hold.

While that may not be enough to bring back buyers, experts believe more opaque methods of buying Russian oil may continue.", "content": "New Delhi: New Delhi: Discounts on Russian oil have jumped in less than a month as buyers shun oil from sanctioned entities Rosneft and Lukoil. International buyers avoided Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, prompting Moscow to offer discounts close to $30 per barrel. Discounts in October, when India and China stepped up purchases, were in the range of $1.7-4 per barrel. They have now increased to $5-6 in the past fortnight, two industry executives said. \"As offtake of Russian oil has dipped, suppliers are increasing the discounts on offer, and are expected to rise further with the sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil coming into effect,\" one of the people cited above said on the condition of anonymity. The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) last month sanctioned Russia's two largest oil companies to pressure its energy sector and force it to retreat from Ukraine. New Delhi has already reduced its dependence on Moscow, though Russia remains India's largest oil supplier. In FY25, Rosneft and Lukoil accounted for about 60% of Russia's total oil exports to India of 88 million tonne. \"As buyers like India are moving away from Russian suppliers that are sanctioned, the discounts would increase to attract more buyers,\" said Prashant Vasisht, senior vice-president and co-group head, corporate ratings, Icra Ltd. While Indian refiners are not engaging Rosneft and Lukoil for new orders, they are still buying oil from smaller, non-sanctioned Russian entities, although for smaller volumes, the executive mentioned earlier said. Reliance Industries had last month said that the company is assessing the implications of restrictions placed on imports of Russian crude by the European Union, United States, and the United Kingdom. “We have noted the recent restrictions announced by the European Union, United Kingdom and the United States on crude oil imports from Russia and export of refined products to Europe.

Lindsay Hoyle, the House of Commons Speaker, wrote to people working in Parliament to raise the alarm, saying he wanted to draw their attention to the Espionage Alert issued by the Security Service, MI5, to the parliamentary community. “The Chinese Ministry of State Security is actively reaching out to individuals in our community,” reported The Telegraph, citing Hoyle. Hoyle further added, \"Their aim is to collect information and lay the groundwork for long-term relationships, using professional networking sites, recruitment agents and consultants acting on their behalf.” The development comes weeks after prosecutors dropped charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry — the two British men charged with spying on members of parliament for China. Cash and Berry were accused of passing information about the government to a top member of Chinese government. However, both denied any wrongdoing, and Beijing called the claims false and 'malicious'. Meanwhile, according to The Telegraph report, stickers banning military staff from discussing secrets have been fitted inside the Ministry of Defence’s fleet of electric cars. “MoD devices are NOT to be connected to [this] vehicle,\" said a message on the sticker. Another message reads, “Avoid conversations above OFFICIAL within the vehicle.” Speaking to China's Global Times, Zuo Xiaodong, China Information Security Research Institute, said that without providing any proof, the accusations are extremely irresponsible. “Jumping to fear-mongering conclusions is utterly irresponsible,” added Zuo.

The announcement reinforces India’s alignment with the Paris Agreement at a time when countries are under pressure to scale up their climate ambitions. NDCs are climate action plans submitted by countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the Paris Agreement. The document outlines each country's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change, and it must be updated every five years with more ambitious goals. India had in 2022 declared its first NDC—of achieving an emission intensity of its GDP (gross domestic product) by 45% by 2030 from the 2005 levels. Emissions intensity of GDP refers to the amount of carbon dioxide emission produced per unit of GDP—a measure to evaluate how efficiently an economy uses carbon-based resources to generate economic output. \"It is heartening to know that India will soon release its revised NDCs. This announcement puts to rest unnecessary speculation about India’s commitment to the Paris Agreement. India has already achieved its previous NDC targets five years ahead of schedule, and I am confident that its new pledges will further strengthen its position as a global leader in climate action,\" said Dr Chandra Bhushan, chief executive officer, iFOREST, an independent non-profit research and innovation organization working on pressing environmental-development challenges in Indi", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-cop30-climate-commitments-ndc-brazil-11763461926741.html", "timestamp": 1763507964.227041}

The event was held at Ramoji Film City and was attended by over 50,000 fans and industry members. Following technical glitches during the teaser presentation, which delayed proceedings, SS Rajamouli began his speech by referencing his lack of belief in God. “I don’t have much faith in gods. This is an emotional moment for me. I don’t believe in God. My dad came and said Lord Hanuman will take care of things for me. After the glitch happened, I raised my voice at him, saying, ‘Is this how he leads me?’ My wife is a big admirer of Hanuman. She treats the God like her friend and talks to him. I expressed my anger at her too, saying, ‘Is this how he does things?’” Rajamouli had said. Rashtriya Vanarasena organisation claimed Rajamouli's comments hurt the sentiments of Hindus and raised alarm over what it called a growing pattern of disrespect toward Hindu deities in the film industry. Following the Varanasi event, organisations including Vanarasena and Gow Rakshak Sangh submitted a written complaint at the Saroor Nagar Police Station, accusing Rajamouli of “intentionally insulting Hindu deities” and delivering remarks “with the intention of provoking religious hatred,\" mentioned a report by India Today. Varanasi is SS Rajamouli’s upcoming film after his global hit RRR, which received praise from across the world. The film even bagged an Oscar for the song Naatu Naatu, composed by MM Keeravaani.

Apart from serving economic necessities, there could also be political gains from this move, experts say.", "content": "New Delhi: The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) on Monday pushed back enforcement of its newly-amended standards for handloom cotton muslin and handloom cotton mix sarees to May 2026, offering much-needed relief to weavers who faced steep costs from stricter fibre rules, new testing methods and fresh certification requirements. A similar reprieve was also given to the raw sugar sector. These norms were earlier set for enforcement on 3 November 2025. The relaxation in norms come following the recommendations of a Niti Aayog committee, led by former cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, that favoured relaxing quality control orders (QCOs). These mandatory compliance norms, while looking to improve quality, raise input cost, limit sourcing and strain testing capacity for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). QCOs are government mandates that require products to meet BIS standards before manufacture, import or sale. They started with consumer goods and later expanded to petrochemicals, polymers, plastics, chemicals, machinery, electrical equipment and other industrial inputs. The regime grew rapidly after 2014, crossing 700 products by 2025, before the government began deferring deadlines and rolling back several QCOs mid-2024 onwards. Through its latest notification, by allowing the previous specifications to remain valid until May 2026, the BIS has effectively postponed the cost and disruption that would have come from immediate enforcement. This will benefit handloom clusters in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, and it also gives sugar mills time to exhaust their old stock without any risk of rejection. Sugar mills in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka also stand to gain. The move comes at a time when domestic manufacturers and their trade partners had raised concern about India’s aggressive rollout of QCOs.

It's OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,\" remarked the President. However, Trump was quick to clarify that he didn't say he was doing it (launching strikes). “I'd be proud to do it. Because we're going to save millions of lives by doing it.” Meanwhile, the President said that he will also talk to Nicolas Maduro , adding that the Venezuelan President \"has not been good to the United States.\" The remark gains significance amid Washington's military buildup stoking tensions as the US aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford has been deployed in the Caribbean to tackle drug traffickers based in Latin American countries.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

And more often than not, collaborations happened over an email, WhatsApp chat, and, believe it or not, through a mutual friend’s introduction. In essence, these interactions were spontaneous and full of creative energy. But, also messy.  Having spent years in the industry, I remember countless campaigns where influencers had agreed to do a couple of posts for brands. Everything was set, from launch timelines, media amplification plan, to the PR rollout. But when the posts went live, they didn’t quite live up to the expectations. The brand wanted the product to come off as the hero, while the influencer thought it’d be best to show it as a part of a casual morning routine. It just feels more organic that way. However, the brand disagreed.  At that moment, I realised something very fundamental to influencer marketing, which is that a professional ecosystem can’t run on good intentions and good relationships alone. Over the years, I have witnessed influencer marketing grow at a breakneck pace, from just a buzzword five years back to a whopping Rs 3,600-crore industry today. While we celebrate the growth in opportunities this has brought, we shouldn’t forget the complexities that come with it.  It’s as if content creators are no longer just about funny reels; they’re so much more. Brands have begun looking to them for business value, for their credibility, tone and storytelling. And when a brand invests in an influencer, deadlines, reputation, and clarity take precedence.  With clarity as the need of the hour, contracts become essential. As I often say, a contract isn’t about mistrust but clarity. It safeguards both brands and influencers, not from each other, but from misunderstanding. In my experience, three kinds of conflicts are most common in this space.  1.     Misaligned expectations: It’s the gap between what a brand wants and what an influencer ", "url": "https://yourstory.com/2025/11/growing-need-for-legal-contracts-in-the-influencer-marketing-landscape", "timestamp": 1763507982.298976}

Electricity was scarce, offices ran on punch machines and registers, and computers were just beginning to arrive. Many employees feared they would lose their jobs to automation. “At that time, people thought computerization would vanish their jobs, the same way people talk about AI today,” he recalls.  For Nayak, though, technology was never about redundancy but efficiency. Even a single desktop could speed up licenses, land records, or treasury work that once took days.  Three decades on, that early conviction has scaled nationally. Nayak has helped build some of India’s most critical digital platforms: DigiLocker, UMANG, API Setu, and CoWIN, which powered one of the world’s largest vaccination drives. He has lived the full arc of India’s digital journey: from hesitant rural offices in the 1990s to today’s debates about AI in governance. Nayak frames his career in three phases: a decade each at the district, state, and central levels. Each taught him a different lesson.  The first, in the 1990s, was about introducing computers into places that had never seen them. His early projects focused on digitizing land records, transport offices, and treasury systems.  Resistance was inevitable. But once results were visible, attitudes shifted. A driving license that once took days to issue manually could be processed in hours on a desktop. Productivity gains made the case for change more convincingly than persuasion ever could.  These experiments left him with two enduring insights: adoption depends on visible efficiency, and even small improvements can reduce corruption by curbing discretion and delays.

Studying under professors who were exploring machine learning (ML), Anagh was already ahead of the curve.  In 2015, on an educational trip to Vancouver, one of the global hubs of AI innovation at the time, he witnessed how researchers were debating the right approaches to AI, long before transformers emerged as a dominant model. This was the spark that lit his curiosity, and led him to engage with AI.  Back in India, he pursued advanced AI courses and worked with Goldman Sachs, where he discovered the wide gulf between AI theory and practice. While exploring NLP and applied AI, he accidentally stumbled upon venture capital and in 2019 joined Stellaris Venture Partners - kickstarting a journey of investing in AI. For Anagh, the fundamentals of AI investment are surprisingly similar to other sectors. Be it ecommerce, SaaS or, currently AI, the core focus remains on the size of the opportunity and the strength of the founding team.  “At its heart, it’s about asking: is this a problem people will care deeply about 10 years from now, and if solved, can it create a large business?” he says.

While venture investing may seem overwhelming from the outside, Anagh credits Accel’s culture of simplicity and clarity for shaping his approach.  When it comes to red flags, Anagh has seen the startup landscape evolve. A year ago, many AI ventures risked building products that amounted to little more than features.

But players like CaratLane are changing that.  Gurukeerthi Gurunathan, Co-founder and CTO of CaratLane , recalls how the company set out in 2008 to digitise diamonds, bring transparency to the process, and make jewelry more accessible.  “We launched with a simple mission: diamond jewelry designed to be worn every day. It didn’t have to sit in a locker or break the bank. We wanted to democratise it so that anyone in the country could see the prices and trust the transparency of our systems when buying diamond jewelry,” he says.  CaratLane started as an online-first business—an unusual approach in an industry defined by exclusivity, heavy inventory, and high price points. By positioning diamond jewelry as an everyday accessory rather than a rare luxury, the company carved a niche and scaled quickly.  Gurunathan believes this democratization was possible only through a digital-first model: “Had we focused on physical retail as well, it would have taken us many more years to reach the level of success we enjoy today.”  By 2017–18, the company began experimenting with AI and machine learning. “Traditional logic-driven programming couldn’t capture evolving customer behaviour online,” Gurunathan says.  Machine learning enabled smarter recommendations, better pattern recognition, and personalized experiences, helping CaratLane refine how it engaged with millions of digital shoppers.

This is where he put predictive AI into action. Working across asset classes - real estate, loans, and credit cards - in the US, Setia saw firsthand how predictive AI shaped portfolio pricing and future cash flows. Automation was another key theme. Setia had worked on over 100 automation projects, moving from human-driven orchestration all the way to agentic AI today.  Setia’s encounters with AI, however, began long before his professional career. As a student in finance, his passion for the stock markets pushed him to experiment with logistic regression, linear models, and random forests. There were limitations to what he could do, but these first stabs at working with AI taught him a tough but valuable lesson: the gulf between theory and execution was wider than he thought.  Over the years, his curiosity morphed into deep expertise. Across his career, including at his own startup and later at Paytm, Setia has consistently worked at the intersection of predictive and now agentic AI. Setia leads Paytm’s AI strategy across multiple fronts, building systems that power everything from data infrastructure to fraud prevention and customer care. His role spans four key areas that together form the backbone of Paytm’s AI-led operations.  The first is the data platform , the foundation for every AI initiative. Paytm’s ecosystem runs on petabytes of real-time data, a scale that demands speed, reliability, and clarity. Setia and his team ensure data scientists, managers, and business leaders have seamless access to the data they need.  The second area is data science itself , where Setia becomes a consumer of the very datasets his platform provides. By bridging production and application, he enables smarter models and cleaner outputs that scale across Paytm’s vast user base.  “That's the best part because I am on the producer side of the data as well as the consumer side.

So we have to find out your cause and purpose today,\" said Saini, at a masterclass at TechSparks 2025 .  “If you don't have a real reason behind why you're doing it, you will not have stories or experiences to share,” he added.  And if one is really passionate about the cause and wants to be taken seriously, LinkedIn is the platform for that, Saini advocated.  His firm helps founders and investors build their personal brand on the Microsoft-owned platform.  Saini pointed out that personal branding has become essential for founders, especially those building consumer-facing companies. The decade-old playbook of relying purely on performance marketing no longer works.  “Why is performance marketing today not giving the kind of results it did 10 years ago?” he asked. “Because now everybody is doing it. If you start building your personal brand today, ten years later you’ll be trusted a lot more.”  He also argued that this is the perfect time for founders and investors to build a presence on LinkedIn, given how few people are truly influential on the platform.  “Out of more than a billion users, only about 1% actually have influence,” said Saini. “There are 10 million content creators, executive coaches, and around 900,000 founders across the world—that’s your competition. But only 1% of them truly have reach and credibility.”  According to Saini, once a founder identifies their cause, three elements become crucial to building a long-term personal brand.  The first is credibility. “Credibility is proof. Past work that serves as evidence,” he said, pointing to Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal as an example.

The disruption, which started on Tuesday afternoon, saw several sites not being able to function.  Cloudflare is one of the key infrastructure providers for internet traffic and operates as a content delivery network and distributed DNS (domain name server). Cloudflare's services protect website owners from peak loads, comment spam attacks and DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. Fundamentally, it keeps internet traffic going whenever there is a spike or a cyber attack.  According to information available on Downdetector, the website that monitors internet outages, the majority of the impact was on the server connection, followed by problems with website connectivity and DNS being down.  Reports said that Cloudflare was aware of the issue but did not specify the cause of the outage.  “Cloudflare is experiencing an internal service degradation. Some services may be intermittently impacted. We are focused on restoring service. We will update as we are able to remediate. More updates to follow shortly,” the company said on its status page.  Several users flocked to the online platforms to complain about the outage. Cloudflare CTO Dane Knecht, in a message on X, said, “In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services.”  The outage of Cloudflare reflects a similar situation that arose when there was a large-scale outage on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which had a worldwide impact that lasted several hours.

This broad mandate reflects the government’s intention to nurture an end-to-end private space industry that can serve national needs and compete globally.

India’s trade deficit widened to a record high last month, due to a rise in gold imports and a fall in US-bound exports during the second consecutive month of steep tariffs on Indian goods.  The levies have hit labour-intensive sectors, including textiles, leather, footwear, and gems and jewellery, the hardest. While the RBI announced relief measures for exporters last week, including collateral-free loans and other programmes, bankers hold that this may pressure the rupee and delay bringing back foreign earnings.  For the time being, farmers can breathe easy, as Indian agricultural exporters are set to benefit from US exemptions of dozens of food items from the reciprocal tariffs regime—which some analysts say could help to revive lost demand.  Meanwhile, as the government courts a trade deal with the US to alleviate the crippling tariffs placed on it, India’s state-run refiners have signed their first long-term deal with the US to import 2.2 million tons of LPG next year.

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality.

This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms.

These iconic locations have long attracted students with their familiar landmarks and well-established university systems.

If you’re looking to stand out, grow in unexpected ways, and explore the world beyond postcard-perfect cities, these programs might be exactly what you’re looking for!
