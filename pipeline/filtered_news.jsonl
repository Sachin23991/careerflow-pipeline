The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause.

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach. Also Read| Common mistakes aspirants make and how to avoid them It’s natural to want to master every topic, but the CAT doesn’t reward perfection; it rewards strategy. Drop low-probability or time-consuming areas that have consistently pulled you down. For instance, if Geometry or Puzzles continue to drain time, it’s wiser to move on. The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one. Your confidence, calmness, and ability to focus for three hours matter more than your percentile predictions. Sleep well, eat right, and stay active.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states.

Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

The Language and Cognition Laboratory, established within the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, is claimed as the first lab in India dedicated to systematically exploring the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation. In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages. In the long term, it plans to integrate advanced neurocognitive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). These tools will enable comprehensive research in language, cognition, and computational modelling while fostering collaboration with experts in psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

The move brings the state-level entrance exam at par with the national Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), which offers engineering aspirants two chances to improve their performance and secure admissions to professional courses. The decision was announced by Maharashtra’s Higher and Technical Education Minister Chandrakant Patil on Tuesday, after a review meeting with the State Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell, which conducts various entrance tests for higher education in Maharashtra. Patil said, “At the national level, two JEE entrance examinations are conducted, giving students two opportunities. Similarly, students in Maharashtra will also get two opportunities through these two entrance exams.” From the 2026 admission cycle, MHT-CET will be conducted in two sessions — first in April and then in May 2026. Appearing for at least one session will be mandatory for admission to professional courses, while appearing for both will remain optional.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music.

The latest edition of the annual study, released by ETS in collaboration with CII, AICTE, AIU, and Taggd, reveals that the country’s overall employability has risen to 56.35 per cent, up from 54.81 per cent last year. The growth underscores India’s accelerating shift toward a skill-first, AI-driven economy, powered by the rise of gig work, remote employment, and digital mobility. The employability figure marks a significant jump from 54.81 per cent in 2025, underscoring the country’s steady progress toward a “skill-first economy.” Between 2022 and 2026, India’s employability surged from 46.2 per cent to 56.3 per cent, a trend attributed to expanding access to modular training, digital tools, and AI-integrated learning models.

The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.) As for all that customer demand, Burry has basically proposed it’s a mirage because AI cu", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/", "timestamp": 1764322398.8673155}

Although the iPad started off as a simple device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into powerful machines that can be used to do things like create digital art and edit videos. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best iPad apps for creativity that are available on the App Store. Before we get into the list, it’s worth noting that although Adobe’s creative apps are often top choices for creativity on the iPad, this list won’t include them because they are already well-known. The list will instead focus on somewhat lesser-known apps. Procreate is one of the most popular drawing apps for the iPad, and for good reason. The app lets you create digital paintings, sketches, and illustrations using dozens of different types of brushes. Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop. Once you’re finished creating your piece, you can relive your creative journey with the app’s time-lapse “Replay” feature and share a 30-second time-lapse video on social media. You can access Procreate with a one-time payment of $12.99. LumaFusion is a great app for editing videos if you’re ready to graduate from iMovie.

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase. They’re already launching a pilot with Great Plains Industrial Park, and their next product Glīder is about to hit the market. And the team is hiring for roles in nearly every aspect of the business.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained.

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them.

Baris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, is leaving the company effective December 12, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. CNBC was the first to report the departure. Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google. The departures come several months after GM hired Sterling Anderson to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson’s role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM. Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. The departures are part of a restructuring within GM that’s supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company’s cars, trucks, and SUVs. Instead of separate teams, each with overlapping roles, the plan is to integrate hardware and software engineering, AI capabilities, and global product into one organization, according to a series of statements covering each executive’s departure. As Anderson reshapes the organization, he is also bringing in new talent.

The Nordics, specifically, are having a moment, led this time around by Sweden’s vibe-coding darling Lovable, often regarded as an example of the ecosystem’s growing success. Other standout, albeit older names, include Klarna and Spotify. On this week’s Equity, we sat down with Dennis Green-Lieber, the founder of the AI company Propane, to talk about the booming success of the Nordic ecosystem. Green-Lieber is based in Denmark and has been building in the ecosystem for the past 15 years. He chalked up the success of the ecosystem to a few things, including the region’s social safety that lets young people take risks without fear of losing everything. “The newer founders, new generations, are being way more bullish and taking ownership,” he told Equity. “I have not seen, in my 15 years, anything [like] what’s going on right now.” It’s becoming a hub for deep tech and AI, as one report put it, and is now valued at half a trillion dollars, with Nordic startups receiving a little more than $8 billion in venture investments in 2024. The government also plays a part in these companies, providing funding to startups, like Green-Lieber’s, to help founders grow their companies. In some ways, Green-Lieber agrees with others that the ecosystem is a few years behind — but, at the same time, “we’re moving tremendously a lot faster,” he said. We couldn’t leave the conversation without talking about AI a little. When asked if we were in a bubble, Green-Lieber said he didn’t know. “There’s tons of opportunities which haven’t been explored,” he said, adding that it’s true that some people are just putting money in bad stuff, but “that’s just the risk of venture capital.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

The project would occupy 88 acres to the west and to the south of the data center. A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center’s estimated power use . Musk’s company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NO X pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually. The turbines have sparked fierce opposition from residents in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black community where researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels increased by 79% in areas immediately surrounding the data center after xAI began operations. Community activists have reported increased asthma attacks and respiratory issues since the facility opened. The AI company has said that it intends to use the turbines until it can secure additional power, but local officials gave xAI a permit to operate 15 turbines through January 2027. In September, xAI said it would build a 100-megawatt solar farm nearby, which will be paired with 100 megawatts of grid-scale batteries to provide a 24/7 source of electricity. The company hasn’t disclosed the total cost of that project, but the solar farm’s developer, Seven States Power Corporation, was awarded $439 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

There’s an AI for that", "summary": "MyHair AI examines photos of the scalp to help diagnose hair loss and suggest scientifically validated clinics and treatments.", "content": "For Cyriac Lefort , the idea for his new startup, MyHair AI, came two years ago.  The French native was sitting in a hair salon in New York getting a routine haircut when his hairdresser looked at him and said, “You’re starting to lose a bit of hair,” Lefort, who is 32, recalls being told. “He didn’t say that to my friend sitting next to me, just to me,” Lefort continued. “In my mind, I wasn’t balding, and I still don’t think I am. But when someone tells you you’re losing your hair, you buy whatever they suggest.” So, he bought the shampoo the hairdresser suggested and left thinking that anyone could sell a man anything by telling him that he’s losing his hair. “Hair loss is such an emotional topic for men and women,” he said. That interaction sent him down a rabbit hole where he discovered how confusing the hair loss industry is, with so much misinformation and clinics with unverified reviews. (He later went to a hair doctor who told him he was, in fact, not balding.) Lefort wanted to create a product that, using AI, would help men diagnose hair loss. Lefort is a serial entrepreneur, having exited one company and currently running two others with Tilen Babnik , who is 28. The duo decided to team up and build a third company: MyHair AI . They vibe coded the product in just a few weeks. It works like this: Users take photos of their heads and upload them to the MyHair app. The AI technology analyzes those photos to measure hair density and detect early signs of hair loss. Over time, as a user uploads more photos, the AI tracks the evolution of their hair loss, letting people build personalized hair loss-protection routines. Users can also find specialists or discover clinics through the platform and read verified reviews so they do not get scammed. “Our AI tells you what’s really happening with your hair, matches you with products that actually make sense for your hair type, and explains the science behind them, including possible side effects,” Lefort said. “By brin", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/are-you-balding-theres-an-ai-for-that/", "timestamp": 1764322400.4834712}

OpenAI , Google , and Amazon have heavily invested in AI assistants that research new product categories for you and suggest the right ones to buy. Startups like Perplexity , Daydream , and Cherry have also built businesses around AI for product discovery. All these efforts have resulted in customers using more AI for shopping. Onton ( previously known as Deft ), an AI-powered furniture shopping platform, says it has seen its user base grow from 50,000 monthly active users to over 2 million monthly active users, serving millions of searches and image generations. Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup’s total funding to approximately $10 million. Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics. The company rebranded from Deft to Onton earlier this year, citing confusion around the original name and difficulty securing a premium domain. Zach Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. He added that the startup has observed that the average time a consumer takes to make a purchase decision has increased. For its core technology, the company uses what’s called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup’s model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description. “Let’s say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly.

Now, the human safety operator is gone.", "content": "A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless. The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking.

How Does WIRED Find the Best Deals? We spend our entire working lives testing products and, in part, tracking how much they cost. That way, we can spot a good deal from one that's just a markdown of an artificially inflated price (a practice far too common, sadly). We also use price-checking tools like Camelcamelcamel , but since we only cover items we've actually tested, it's not that hard for us to keep track of prices and know what's a good deal and what's not.

Birdfy Amazon (AI by subscription, no solar) Birdfy (solar, no AI) Chewy If you've never dealt with a smart bird feeder before, it can be intimidating. I know multiple people who were gifted a smart bird feeder last year for the holidays and still, in November 2025, have yet to take it out of the box. Apparently they're not alone, because there's now a feeder specifically for the reluctant: the Rookie, which looks like a gravity pet feeder and snaps together in three simple pieces with no tools. You'll still have to charge the 1080p camera (once a week, as this version doesn't come with a solar panel) and calibrate it to the app, but that's it—just pop the camera on its little side stand, fill the seed hopper, attach it to a wall or pole with the included hardware, and you're good to go. Because there's only a side view, you'll get a fair amount of butt shots from birds who are facing the other way, and note that you'll definitely want to site this one out of the way of squirrels , because it's pretty lightweight and the top is easily", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/best-smart-bird-feeder-deals-black-friday-2025/", "timestamp": 1764322403.5384445}

There are pros and cons to each ecosystem, and the need to consider the type of phone you use and the compatibility of the smart doorbell or smart lights you already have. Whether or not you have your own voice assistant preferences, we've organized this guide based on our preferred speaker in each category regardless of whether that's with the same assistant for each pick. Overall, Google- and Amazon-powered smart speakers are the way to go, though we prefer Google's ecosystem over Amazon's. Amazon's speaker lineup is more vast, but our favorite models are still Google's, including the Google Nest Audio for a smart speaker (especially if you want stereo sound and two speakers for a great price) and the Google Nest Hub Max for a smart display. Amazon makes our favorite smaller speakers, though, particularly the new Echo Dot Max .

Courtesy of Yacht; Telefantasy Studios; Noble Robot If you’re in the mood for something a little out there, start with Blippo+ . First released in May on the handheld Playdate console, the game arrived on PC and Switch in September. At first blush, it’s a game about channel surfing. You browse different broadcasts, each of which feature bizarre, retro, live-action transmissions about a minute or so long, from nightly news and soap operas to quiz shows and fuzzy softcore. Every channel runs according to a schedule, which means you’ll need to decide which broadcasts to watch as they run live, and which to try again the next night. The more you watch, the easier it becomes to piece together the overall strange, sci-fi story of Blippo+ , which plays out across these endearingly weird channels. Think ‘80s TV show Max Headroom , but with those vibes sprinkled into everything—including the retro soundtrack by Jona Bechtolt of Yacht and the composer Rob Kieswetter.

Not every pair of smart glasses is the same, as they can support wildly different functionality. Many can accommodate optical prescriptions, though they may require an additional tiny pair of lenses you wear inside the smart glasses. Some have diopter dials so you can adjust the focus separately for each eye. Some smart glasses are as simple as electrochromic (automatically darkening) sunglasses . They may not have other tech in them, but you may see them marketed as “smart glasses.” The most basic type of smart glasses you'll find are ones that act like portable screens. These often have displays or projectors to create a screen only the wearer can see, a series of floating windows, or a kind of heads-up display (HUD) layered on top of reality.

Previously, people outside of a server owner’s network could access the owner’s media library through Plex for free. Under the new rules announced in March, a server owner needs to have a Plex Pass subscription, which starts at $7 per month, to grant users remote access to their server. Alternatively, someone can remotely access another person’s Plex server by buying their own Plex Pass or a Remote Watch Pass , which is a subscription with fewer features than a Plex Pass and that Plex started selling in April for a $2 per month starting price. Plex’s new rules took effect on April 29. According to a recent Plex forums post by a Plex employee that How-To Geek spotted today, the changes are rolling out this week, with a subscription being required for people using Plex’s Roku OS app for remote access. The Plex employee added: This requirement change for remote streaming will come to all other Plex TV apps (Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, etc.) and any third-party clients using the API to offer remote streaming in 2026. Plex started as a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project in 2009 before evolving into a media server company and, more recently, a streaming service provider . Its new remote access rules will be a test for the company, which has been challenging long-time users with numerous changes over the past year, including a Plex Pass price hike, a foray into renting out officially licensed movies , and the introduction of social features and a mobile app redesign . Plex has previously emphasized its need to keep up with “rising costs,” which include providing support for many devices and codecs. It has also said it needs money to implement new features, including an integration with Common Sense Media , a new “bespoke server management app” for managing server users, and “an open and documented API for server integrations,”", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/plex-cracking-down-free-remote-streaming-access/", "timestamp": 1764322405.2847793}

Are the branches strong enough to hold that lopsided homemade macaroni ornament you’ve hung on your tree since 2004? We got tired of guessing, so we did a little experiment. We brought 10 of the most popular artificial trees from three top brands (Balsam Hill, King of Christmas, and National Tree Company) and hauled them to a photo studio in Kansas. There, 10 volunteer assemblers spent a morning unboxing, building, and fluffing every tree, and three professional interior designers scored them. The judges didn’t know the brands. They didn’t know the prices. They didn’t even speak to the assemblers about how the construction of each tree went. They evaluated each tree based solely on how it looked and felt. After our day of testing, we allowed every assembler the chance to take their tree home and set it up for their family. Most did and shared their notes.

In addition to being a password manager, 1Password can act as an authentication app like Google Authenticator, and for added security it creates a secret key to the encryption key it uses, meaning no one can decrypt your passwords without that key. 1Password also offers tight integration with other mobile apps. Rather than needing to copy and paste passwords from your password manager to other apps (which puts your password on the clipboard at least for a moment), 1Password is integrated with many apps and can autofill. This is more noticeable on iOS, where inter-app communication is more restricted. You can get savings on the company’s suite of products with our 1Password coupons and deals.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air.

Sony's top-of-the-line mirrorless camera, the A7R V, is on sale at the lowest price we've ever seen. If you've been thinking of updating, now is the time to buy. The A7R V isn't our top-pick mirrorless camera, but that's mainly because at full price it's expensive relative to the rest of the market. At this price, though, it's a steal, maybe even one of the absolute best Black Friday deals , and while there is no truly best camera for everyone, the A7R V is unquestionably the highest-resolution camera you can buy. And I know, megapixels aren't everything, but I have never taken an image with this camera and thought, darn, that's just too many megapixels. Sony Amazon Adorama B&H Photo The massive 61-megapixel, full-frame sensor in the A7R V is the largest sensor you can get without moving up to a bigger, bulkier medium-format camera. If you want to go totally nuts, get this, landscape photographers: The A7R V can combine 16 shots into a single 240-MP image. It only works with static subjects, but if you ever worried if your images are hi-res enough to cover the side of a building in Times Square, well, you can rest easy with the A7R V. Yes, the megapixel race is silly and mostly over, but I will say that I've shot quite a bit with the A7R C—which uses the same sensor—and images from this 60-MP sensor are noticeable sharper, and the dynamic range is visibly better than what I get from the A7R II (which has a 40-MP sensor). This is obviously the case onscreen, when pixel peeping, but I also notice the difference when I print images. That the A7R V is $900 off does make you wonder if perhaps the A7R VI is on the horizon? Anything is possible, but I kind of doubt it's coming imminently. The A7C R, which as noted above, is nearly identical in features, is still not on sale.

In attendance was Sherjil Ozair, a late addition who had previously held senior research roles at DeepMind and Tesla . The following day, Bajaj and Ozair were on their way to making a deal, public records show. Bajaj didn’t mention it at the dinner, but earlier this year he had begun working with Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos on a new AI venture called Project Prometheus. Backed by $6.2 billion in funding, including from Bezos, Project Prometheus is working on AI systems that can support the manufacturing of computers, cars, and even spacecraft, according to two people familiar with the startup who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The project has brought on over 100 employees, including Ozair and a handful of colleagues who previously worked at his agentic AI startup General Agents, which has now been acquired by Project Prometheus. Last week, The New York Times revealed the first details about Prometheus, including that Bezos and Bajaj will serve as co-CEOs. But its acquisition of General Agents hasn’t been previously reported. Corporate filings in Delaware obtained by WIRED show that Bajaj, who previously cofounded Alphabet’s health sciences company Verily , formed an entity to acquire General Agents the morning after the San Francisco dinner. It merged with Ozair’s startup four days later. Terms of the deal could not be learned. The records list General Agents’ new address as the San Francisco headquarters of Foresite Labs, a Bajaj-led biotech incubator. He and Bezos, who stepped down as Amazon CEO in 2021 , have previously been connected through the billionaire’s investments in biotech companies Bajaj helped start or run, such as Grail and Xaira Therapeutics, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Four members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice tell WIRED that they began asking workers to sign the letter last month. After reaching their initial goal, the group published on Wednesday the job titles of the Amazon employees who signed and disclosed that more than 2,400 supporters from other organizations, including Google and Apple, have also joined in. Backers inside Amazon include high-ranking engineers, senior product leaders, marketing managers, and warehouse staff spanning many divisions of the company. A senior engineering manager with over 20 years at Amazon says they signed because they believe a manufactured “race” to build the best AI has empowered executives to trample workers and the environment. “The current generation of AI has become almost like a drug that companies like Amazon obsess over, use as a cover to lay people off, and use the savings to pay for data centers for AI products no one is paying for,” says the employee, who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from their bosses.

Now newly released satellite images of the targeted KK Park scam center reveal that only buildings in one limited section of the compound were destroyed during the initial raids. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.” High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place. However, the images show the destruction is, so-far, confined to the Eastern side of the gigantic compound—with hundreds of buildings across the vast compound being left untouched. Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. They also raise concerns about the welfare of thousands of people forced to run scams in KK Park. “The junta is making it sound as though they’re taking down the entire compound, and the imagery that we have seen so far is only limited to one section,” says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization. “It’s important to keep monitoring this to verify what they’re actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they’re actually cracking down on the real problem.” The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings.

When WIRED writer Parker Hall reviewed them initially , he called them “the best-sounding wireless headphones [he's] ever heard, and by a significant margin.” Even when stacked up against the big hitters from Bose and Sony, they have an impressively open soundstage, letting details shine in every genre, from highly-produced pop to soft jazz. The active noise canceling is extremely potent as well, with a pass-through mode that's sharp and clear. As long as you're in the Apple ecosystem, these have an impressive level of features and excellent coordination between devices. Like most AirPods, simply hold them near your iPhone or iPad and they'll connect right away, no extensive pairing or app installations.

It also comes with a more secure strap—each side is shaped like a U, instead of using a single strap, making it much more secure.

The deepfakes that followed reveal a growing digital blackface problem.", "content": "When DoorDash delivery driver Livie Rose Henderson posted a video alleging that one of her customers sexually assaulted her in October, it set off a firestorm of reactions. Henderson’s TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer’s front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok’s algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson’s November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.) None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose. But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash’s decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer’s personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jeff Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.” “Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.” “Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off. There's no way I said this. I didn't [want to] talk about this topic,” Larose tells WIRED. The video had been AI-generated.

NASA and Boeing are now targeting no earlier than April 2026 to fly the uncrewed Starliner-1 mission, the space agency said. Launching by next April will require completion of rigorous test, certification, and mission readiness activities, NASA added in a statement . “NASA and Boeing are continuing to rigorously test the Starliner propulsion system in preparation for two potential flights next year,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in a statement. NASA also said it has reached an agreement with Boeing to modify the Commercial Crew contract, signed in 2014, that called for six crewed flights to the space station following certification of the spacecraft. Now the plan is to fly Starliner-1 carrying cargo and then up to three additional missions before the space station is retired. “This modification allows NASA and Boeing to focus on safely certifying the system in 2026, execute Starliner’s first crew rotation when ready, and align our ongoing flight planning for future Starliner missions based on station’s operational needs through 2030,” Stich said. SpaceX and Boeing were both awarded contracts in 2014 to develop crewed spacecraft and fly six operational missions to the space station. SpaceX, with its Crew Dragon vehicle, flew a successful crew test flight in mid-2020 and its first operational mission before the end of that year. Most recently, the Crew-11 mission launched in August, with Crew-12 presently scheduled for February 15. Dragon has served as a reliable transport system for NASA as Boeing has faced development struggles. Starliner’s first flight in December 2019, without crew, had to be truncated after software problems plagued the vehicle.

Most deals are the kind that show up later on your porch from Amazon (see WIRED's guide to the best early Black Friday deals ). But fixture and plumbing mainstay Kohler is doing something a little different, and a lot bigger, for the holidays. After all, Kohler is big—one of the biggest family-owned manufacturing empires in the country. And the stuff it sells is big. And so Kohler's Black Friday sale likewise thinks big, offering discounts on life-changing bathroom and kitchen installations. Enter the promo code BFCM25, and you'll get 5 percent off bath and kitchen orders above $800, and 10 percent off orders bigger than $1,600. Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars. Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough) . But then a decade later, Kohler quite literally invented the American bathtub—a clawfoot design still popular today among those with a yen for nostalgia. By the 1910s, according to their company history, Kohler also inaugurated the “integrated-apron” bathtub that's in more common use today. So Kohler knows how to make a bathtub, is what we're saying—including a wide variety of hydrotherapy models—and handsome shower fixtures. Modern bathroom collections from Kohler include decor sets designed by lifestyle influencers like Jenn Lake or Jenni Yolo , as well as some people who are not named Jennifer. But around the WIRED Reviews team, Kohler is mostly considered heroic because they make WIRED's favorite bidet priced for mere mortals. Which is to say, they make the best version of the most civilized domestic innovation of the current millennium.

This is a chance to secure some gifts for the holiday season, snag those gadgets you've been eyeing for yourself, and avoid paying full price for anything. While there are worthy bargains in the deluge, you'll also find people recommending devices they've never actually used at prices that aren't really discounted. WIRED’s list of the absolute best Black Friday deals is different. Everything here was hands-on tested by a member of our Reviews team and recommended. And we track prices through the year, to ensure that any deal we feature actually is a discount. Black Friday morning update: Thanks given, now it's time to shop, and we've just added a freshly brewed batch of deals on coffee machines, computer peripherals, mobile accessories, security cameras, and water filters. How Does WIRED Find the Best Deals? We spend our entire working lives testing products and, in part, tracking how much they cost. That way, we can spot a good deal from one that's just a markdown of an artificially inflated price (a practice far too common, sadly). We also use price-checking tools like Camelcamelcamel , but since we only cover items we've actually tested, it's not that hard for us to keep track of prices and know what's a good deal and what's not. What Is the Best Time to Shop? In a word: now. The best Black Friday deals are happening right now, and we've rounded up our favorites in this guide. In the olden days, Black Friday was just one day long. Shoppers would camp outside of stores, paper circulars in hand, eagerly awaiting the chance to bust down some doors and save a ton of cash. Fast-forward to the internet, and now Black Friday lasts more or less the entire month of November.

Carrying several types of phones, tablets, keyboards, and other tech gear, OnePlus uses an Android-based operating system, is universally unblocked and works with all US carriers. We know how important your tech purchases are (duh, we’re WIRED) and we have a OnePlus promo code to help you save. OnePlus Black Friday sales promise hundreds of dollars and huge savings on some of our favorite WIRED-tested tech. This means slashed prices, like the OnePlus 13 for $700 ($200 off), the OnePlus Watch 3 for $250 ($100 off), and the OnePlus 12 for $900. On November 13, the anticipated OnePlus 15 is launching, with new buzz-worthy features and improvements on the already-polished tech from techy fan favorite, OnePlus. It’s true what they say: the early bird gets the worm. When you subscribe today for OnePlus newsletters and information about the latest drops, you can get $50 off or a chance to win the OnePlus Pad 3 for free. And, if you decide on the OnePlus 13 instead, you can get a Black Eclipse12 GB RAM with 256 GB ROM for $900, and get a free gift with purchase. As mentioned, we at WIRED love OnePlus because of the affordable price point while maintaining solid quality. The newest iteration of the OnePlus 12 impressed us. One of the biggest drawbacks in previous models was the camera quality, but OnePlus has done a lot of work to improve it in the past few years and it’s now on level with competitors like Samsung. Our senior reviews editor and tech overlord Julian Chokkattu called the newest iteration a “Very Good Phone” (high praise from him). It also charges with blazing speed.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

Officials warn the toll may rise.", "content": "The scale of devastation from Hong Kong’s deadliest residential blaze in recent memory became clearer on Friday, as officials confirmed a sharply rising death toll after firefighters subdued the inferno 42 hours after it first erupted. At least 128 people have been confirmed dead and 79 injured, with authorities warning that the true toll may be significantly higher. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said the situation remains deeply fluid, with rescue teams still making their way through burnt-out floors and unstable structures across several tower blocks in the Tai Po district. He cautioned that the final figures could be “considerably higher,” revealing that around 200 residents remain unaccounted for. This number includes bodies yet to be identified, underscoring the severity of the destruction. Government officials said the Hong Kong high-rise blaze appears to have originated in the protective netting on the building’s lower floors, before rapidly intensifying. They noted that flammable foam boards and extensive bamboo scaffolding used during renovation works played a significant role in accelerating the fire’s spread through the tower complex. Police investigators are still determining the cause of the initial fire, but early evidence points to hazardous conditions created by ongoing renovation works at Wang Fuk Court , a densely built public housing estate of more than 4,000 residents — many of them elderly. Authorities believe the blaze began on the lower floors of Wang Cheong House, one of eight towers wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and encased in green protective netting. This combination, along with flammable construction materials, created a deadly pathway for the fire to leap from floor to floor and later from building to building.

In a recent interview aired on BBC Newsnight a week ago, Pichai said the company's quantum programme is reaching a tipping point, stating, “I would say quantum is there where maybe AI was 5 years ago. So I think in five years from now we'll be going through a very exciting phase in quantum.” He added that Google is pouring major investments into this next phase. For investors hunting for the next big “AI-level” boom before everyone else sees it coming, his comments have sparked speculation about the future of deep tech on social media. Sundar Pichai described quantum computing as a fundamental shift, not just another tech upgrade. He told the BBC that Google is leading the field in quantum research, and since things like nature and the universe are fundamentally based on the principles of quantum mechanics, it can contribute to many societal benefits. “We have the state-of-the-art quantum computing efforts in the world…building quantum systems I think will help us better simulate and understand nature and unlock many benefits for society,” he added. This on-record statement from a top Big Tech CEO putting a timeline on when quantum could become commercial comes shortly after Alphabet Inc’s Google developed an algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” on its “Willow” quantum computing chip — a system the company claims can replicate on similar systems and even outperform classical supercomputers. Quantum computing is an advanced form of computation that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems, comparatively faster than classical computers.

Her account gained attention only after she detailed the incident in a viral social media post, prompting authorities to respond. Bharati Chaturvedi — environmental activist and founder of Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group — was travelling from Vasant Vihar to Sarvodaya Enclave on Wednesday when the alleged assault took place. Sharing her experience on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn, she wrote, “Today, for the first time in my life, I was assaulted.” Already breathless due to Delhi’s hazardous pollution levels, which she said had aggravated her asthma, Chaturvedi claimed the driver stopped far from the designated drop point and became increasingly hostile when asked to follow the correct route. He then allegedly sped past the turn and diverted down a secluded lane, refusing to stop.

Bilateral trade rose by a fifth to $100.06 billion in FY25, reaffirming the UAE’s position as one of India’s most important economic partners. The Joint Committee under CEPA met in New Delhi, and discussed steps to resolve operational frictions that have surfaced since CEPA’s implementation, particularly in gold import quotas, data-sharing, rules of origin certification, and regulatory coordination for products that require technical clearances, the commerce ministry said in a statement. India explained its recent move to allocate gold TRQ (tariff rate quotas) through a competitive bidding process, a move aimed at addressing transparency concerns and ensuring more predictable access for domestic jewellers who rely on imports from the UAE. Under the TRQ system, a country permits imports of a certain quantity of product to enter at a lower or zero tariff . Any imports beyond this quota face higher taxes. New Delhi is pushing for smoother certification procedures and clearer product-specific rules that can help exporters in sectors such as food products, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals and textiles.

His demand for a 90,000-square-foot addition has put him at odds with architect James McCrery II, who has urged restraint, warning that the new structure could overshadow the 55,000-square-foot White House.

She's no longer with us”. While addressing troops, he said another soldier, Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life in very bad shape\". Both were shot in an ambush near the White House by an Afghan national, an incident that led his administration to blame Biden-era immigration screening lapses and launch an extensive review of asylum applications, according to Reuters . Meanwhile, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) has raided several locations as part of its expanding investigation, among them a Washington state residence tied to the suspect, who officials say served in a CIA-supported unit in Afghanistan before entering the United States in 2021 through a resettlement programme. According to FBI Director Kash Patel, agents collected a variety of electronic devices, such as phones, laptops, and iPads, from the home of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal. The shooter had a revolver, a .357 Magnum and shot again at one member before firing numerous times at the second member, the report said. The gunman was reportedly injured in an exchange of fire with Guard members before he was taken into custody. His family members have been questioned. Jeanine Pirro, the US Attorney for Washington, DC, said Lakanwal drove across the country before allegedly attacking the Guard members in a surprise assault as they conducted ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/sarah-beckstrom-national-guard-member-shot-near-white-house-dies-shooter-in-serious-condition-11764287365999.html", "timestamp": 1764322470.599814}

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025?
