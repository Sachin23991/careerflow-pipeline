Activists and Congress leaders raised questions about how aspirants who have cleared UGC-NET, JRF and other top competitive exams failed to secure even the minimum 35 per cent marks required to qualify in the subject knowledge test, results of which came out on Tuesday. Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) authorities could not be contacted for their comment on the matter.

Only 151 were able to score a minimum of 35 per cent marks in the round who have now made it to the interview round. The recruitment process began with a screening test held on June 8, an objective exam with MCQs for 100 marks. Of the nearly 4,500 who appeared, nearly 2,000 were shortlisted for the subject knowledge test — a descriptive exam for 150 marks. Activist Shweta Dhull, who is known to take up issues of government job aspirants across the state, said it was “hard to believe” that the vast majority of highly qualified candidates are not even able to secure the qualifying 35 per cent in the exam. The issue, she said, isn’t just about the exam for assistant professor posts but about every exam conducted by the HPSC. A PhD student, who could not clear the subject knowledge test, said many aspirants from top varsities, including university toppers, have failed to secure the minimum score in the test, leaving everyone shocked. “We are not saying that the 151 who have qualified are undeserving or have not qualified on merit. But I know many who could not make it were toppers in other exams. Our contention also is that for 613 vacancies, generally 1,200 should have been called for an interview. “How will the vacancies now be filled when only 151 ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/hpsc-recruitment-drive-600-teaching-posts-in-haryana-but-just-151-make-the-cut-10402190/", "timestamp": 1764880302.1915684}

According to Vaishnaw, vacancies in the Railways arise on a continuous basis due to the organisation’s vast workforce, ongoing technological upgrades and operational expansion.

Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year.

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

Sangma announced the release of the second and final instalment of the Umbrella Post Matric Scholarship , amounting to ₹130 crore, for nearly 70,000 students for the 2024-25 academic year on Friday. The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government. He announced that reforms to address long-standing issues faced by ad hoc and SSA teachers are nearing completion and could be implemented in the next financial year. The program also included participation from thousands of students virtually joining from 200 locations across the state. Sangma took this opportunity to outline the government’s long-term vision, which features youth-focused initiatives such as CM Elevate, YESS Meghalaya, PRIME, MGMP, STAR, and Hello Meghalaya. “Entrepreneurship and skilling of the youth is critical for the state’s growth story,” he said.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

This is the time when most students are juggling multiple demands—revision, full-length syllabus coverage, coaching classes, test series, and the pressure to meet their own expectations. As the exam inches closer, it is natural to experience stress and a sense of urgency to perform well. Amidst all this, aspirants often look for methods that can make their preparation more effective, structured, and result-oriented. Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit.

The growing interest is reflective of the field’s importance in semiconductor design, telecommunications, embedded systems, and next-generation hardware technologies. A notable highlight this year is the sharp rise in Engineering Physics, which registered the steepest growth of 20.74 per cent — increasing from 6,878 to 8,305 candidates. The surge signals a rising inclination among students toward physics-driven research domains such as quantum technologies, photonics, and advanced instrumentation. IIT Bhubaneswar also introduced a new programme, Mathematics and Computing, which garnered an impressive 12,580 candidate choices in its very first year. The response suggests strong enthusiasm for mathematically intensive computing disciplines, driven by growing career pathways in algorithms, data science, and computational modelling. Among the core engineering branches, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering witnessed healthy increases of 13.09, 13.07, and 11.76 per cent, respectively.

Musk replied to another user who had noticed the newest update to the software, known as FSD, was not flashing a warning as he used his phone while driving. The Tesla CEO wrote the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.” Musk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Nearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Despite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. And drivers, who are warned by Tesla to keep their hands on the wheel even when FSD is engaged, are liable. FSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver assistance systems. Musk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident. Regulators have found more than a dozen fatal crashes in which Autopilot was active.

We’ve talked a lot about product-market fit, but this week we take a step back to something just as essential and far less discussed: founder-market fit. Investors love to ask, “What’s your competitive advantage?” Usually they’re talking about moats, IP, and defensibility. But before you ever write a line of code, you already have assets: your background, your experiences, your reputation, your network. Most founders simply forget to treat those as strategic tools. As the saying goes, “if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.” Be intentional about who you surround yourself with, build a focused network, and share your unique expertise boldly. This week, Isabelle sits down with Kyle Rudolph and Jon Walburg , co-founders of Alltroo , a fundraising platform that transforms celebrity access into once-in-a-lifetime charitable sweepstakes, from swimming with Michael Phelps to Oktoberfest at Arnold Schwarzenegger’s house. Kyle and Jon’s story shows that while celebrity status can open doors, it’s the execution, trust, and authenticity behind the company that keeps those doors open. Their credibility — rooted in Kyle’s career with the Minnesota Vikings, co-founder Jason Zucker’s career with the Buffalo Sabres, Jon’s operator background, and the early crowdfunding success that inspired their model — forms a powerful foundation of founder-market fit that’s hard to copy. Their pivot from exclusive $10,000 golf events to accessible $10 sweepstakes demonstrates how democratizing access can actually elevate prestige when done with intention. And while not every founder begins with celebrity reach, every founder does begin with a network and the ability to grow influence. The real differentiator is how you activate it: strategically, authentically, and in ways that create clear value.

Again.", "content": "Harvey on Thursday confirmed it closed a round of funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz, that values the legal AI startup at $8 billion after reports of the funding leaked in October . The startup raised $160 million in the round. This latest capital infusion came just months after it raised $300 million in a Series E round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation in February. Harvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey released some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams.

That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so.

On Thursday, Amnesty and a coalition of media partners, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz , Greek news site Inside Story , and Swiss outlet Inside IT , published a series of reports based on leaked material from Intellexa, including internal company documents, sales and marketing material, and training videos. Perhaps the most striking revelation is that people working at Intellexa could allegedly remotely access the surveillance systems of at least some of its customers via TeamViewer, an off-the-shelf tool that allows users to connect to other computers over the internet. The remote access is shown in a leaked training video revealing privileged parts of the Predator spyware system, including its dashboard, as well as the “storage system containing photos, messages and all other surveillance data gathered from victims of the Predator spyware,” Amnesty wrote in its report. (Amnesty published screenshots taken from the video, but not the full video.) The nonprofit researchers wrote that the leaked video shows apparent “live” Predator infection attempts “against real targets,” based on detailed information “from at least one infection attempt against a target in Kazakhstan.” The video contained the infection URL, the target’s IP address, and the software versions of the target’s phone. Companies that sell spyware to government agencies, such as NSO Group and the now-defunct Hacking Team, have long maintained that they never have access to the data of their customers’ targets, nor their customers’ systems.

The rules also close a loophole allowing police to issue tickets for driverless vehicles.", "content": "California regulators have released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, the agency that regulates autonomous vehicles in the state, opened a 15-day comment period for the proposed revisions that ends December 18. California is home to numerous companies developing and testing autonomous vehicle technology in the state. And while robotaxis have become commonplace in the San Francisco Bay Area and parts of Los Angeles, autonomous trucks are absent because regulations ban any driverless vehicles weighing over 10,000 pounds from testing on public roads. The agency, which has considered lifting the ban for a couple of years now, released a draft of the proposed changes in 2024. The final proposed revisions were released Wednesday. The revised regulations cover a few areas beyond self-driving trucks, including language that appears to give law enforcement the power to issue traffic tickets to driverless vehicles — an issue that has received more attention as Waymo has expanded its commercial robotaxi operation in the state. The self-driving trucks component is by far the most contentious. The revisions reflect feedback received during the initial public comment period this spring, the agency said. The proposal was met with enthusiasm by companies developing autonomous vehicle technology, many of which are based in California, but test on highways in other states like Texas. Companies like Aurora Innovation and Kodiak AI eventually want to use self-driving trucks to carry freight along commerce-heavy freeways across states. “The California DMV’s latest draft regulations show real progress toward creating a regulatory framework for driverless trucks in the state and unlocking coast-to-coast autonomous operations,” Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, said in an emailed statement. “These proposed regulations are a critical step towa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/californias-ban-on-self-driving-trucks-could-soon-be-over/", "timestamp": 1764880623.8231943}

After years of working in communications — including executive roles that gave her deep insight into how startups operate — Bucher realized she could either use her business acumen to become one of the most effective PR reps in the game, or evolve into something more. “I was seeing what was going on in business, and because I could understand the context, I understood business, and because I understood business, my PR pitches would be very business focused,” Bucher told TechCrunch on today’s episode of Equity. She founded Day One Ventures in 2018 after realizing she could create more impact — and make better returns — by investing in startups and providing them with integrated PR support. By combining these two functions, she could help portfolio companies more meaningfully while backing only the stories she truly believed in. “The structure of PR services is very misaligned,” Bucher said, noting that PR firms working on a contract basis often lean toward working slower so they can stretch out client payments. “For startups, it’s really important to move fast.” Beyond speed, there’s a cost barrier: “Early-stage companies shouldn’t be paying $10, $20, or $30 grand per month for six months to get one announcement in TechCrunch. I just don’t think that’s fair, and I don’t think it’s sustainable.” Day One’s integrated model allows Bucher to work with startups at critical early stages when they need support most. Younger startups might pivot or experience founder shake-ups, and “you need to be trusted to advise and help them make decisions.” Backing a company financially gives her something many traditional PR firms can’t offer: She’s literally invested in the story. “I have an ambition to be, ideally, the first investor in the most important and ambitious ideas and companies of our time,” Bucher said. “I think that starts with you understanding", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/why-day-one-ventures-masha-bucher-thinks-vcs-and-storytelling-go-hand-in-hand/", "timestamp": 1764880624.3226595}

The new AI assistant being tested is designed to offer more personalized help with things like account recovery, managing your profile, or updating your settings. This particular feature will first be available to Facebook users, but the company expects to roll it out to other apps in the future. The company claims that its use of AI systems is helping protect users’ accounts, noting that account hacks have decreased by over 30% globally across Facebook and Instagram. AI is also used to help identify and stop other threats, like phishing, suspicious logins, compromised accounts, and more.

The company says the new feed is designed to help users do things like discover a new restaurant close to home or find a new place to explore during a trip. The nearby feed is rolling out to the U.K., France, Italy, and Germany. TikTok was first spotted testing a Nearby feed back in 2022 , when it had rolled it out to select users in Southeast Asia. “Posts in the Nearby Feed are shown to people based on location, the topic of the content, and when the content was posted,” TikTok explained in the blog post . “For example, people can see local content related to travel, events, food & drink, and other services based on their interests and engagement. For creators, this means their public posts may be available to people located in the city/region where they posted or tagged a location or service.” TikTok says sharing your location is optional and that the option is only available to users who are 18 or older. When your location setting is enabled, TikTok may use your device’s GPS-based location when the app is in use to provide more accurate, location-based recommendations. For iOS users, they will see a visible indicator when their location is being accessed. The company notes that it “continues to collect and use location information in line with local laws.” TikTok content won’t appear in the Nearby Feed if someone is under 18 years old, has a private account, or sets their post privacy to Friends or Only You. If people want to see “Nearby” content from a different place, they can change their location by selecting the location name and then following the steps to update it. The company says this can be useful when you’re traveling or want to do some research for your next trip. “The Nearby Feed also supports local economies by increasing visibility for small businesses, cultural institutions, and local creators,” TikTok wrote in the blog post. “The Nearby Feed helps d", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/tiktok-rolls-out-a-nearby-feed-to-display-local-content-in-select-countries/", "timestamp": 1764880625.6500978}

Company executives are mulling slashing the virtual reality platform’s budget by up to 30%, the report said, adding that any reductions would also include layoffs. If Meta does go ahead with such a plan, the move would reflect the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware — both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers. Since Meta’s rebrand in 2021, investors have been skeptical of the company’s allocation of resources to Metaverse projects, which lose billions of dollars each quarter. The company’s efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep . Meta’s shares rose , however, following this report.

The streaming service reports that Wrapped 2025 saw over 200 million engaged users within the first 24 hours,  19% more than last year’s AI-centered flop. Last year, it took Wrapped 62 hours to reach 200 million users, the company noted. Engaged users are counted as those who have viewed at least one of the stories within the Wrapped experience. In addition, Spotify said Wrapped was shared more than 500 million times this year, 41% more than last year. This includes native shares from within the app, as well as screenshots and downloads. In particular, markets like the U.S., India, Indonesia, Japan, Colombia, and Thailand drove the metrics this year. Wrapped, the popular annual review of Spotify’s users’ listening history and stats, had a rough reception last year, as people criticized the lack of detailed stats, and the focus on the inclusion of an AI podcast over other clever and creative data stories. Spotify took that feedback into account for this year’s Wrapped, adding nearly a dozen new features and deeper data drives. While it did use AI behind the scenes, the new Wrapped didn’t include a consumer-facing AI experience. Instead, Spotify focused on letting users connect with each other by allowing them to compare their “listening age,” their Wrapped group (a category of listeners), and with its first live, multiplayer feature, Wrapped Party , that offered real-time data and stat comparisons.

The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform and, consequently, to its sizable customer base. “Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in the blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers. Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis. Customers will also be able to use the models to build their own custom agents. “Enterprises have spent years building secure, trusted data environments, and now they want AI that can work within those environments without compromise,” Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic, said in a statement. “This partnership brings Claude directly into Snowflake, where that data already lives. It’s a meaningful step toward making frontier AI genuinely useful for businesses.” Anthropic has struck a slew of large enterprise deals in recent months as it seeks to prioritize selling to businesses instead of individual users — a strategy in contrast to its arch-rival OpenAI, which has taken a more popular route to growth.

The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app. WhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app. Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API. In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).” “As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote. “AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond. We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully from this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,” Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition at the European Commission, said in a statement. “This is why we are investigating if Meta’s new policy might be illegal under competition rules, and whether we should act quickly to prevent any possible irreparable harm to competition i", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/eu-investigating-meta-over-policy-change-that-bans-rival-ai-chatbots-from-whatsapp/", "timestamp": 1764880627.9796371}

For 2025, the winning iPhone app was visual planner Tiimo, and the iPhone game of the year was the card game Pokémon TCG Pocket. Although Apple has continued to avoid naming a dedicated AI app or AI chatbot as its app of the year, AI was showcased among this year’s winners. Apple’s app of the year, Tiimo , for instance, is described as a visual AI planner that turns to-dos into plans with visual timelines. The app uses AI to break down your tasks into a realistic schedule by estimating how long each step of a task could take and helping you to create a plan. Meanwhile, the iPad app of the year, Detail , simplifies video editing with an “Auto Edit” AI feature that handles things like silence removal, zoom cuts, and adding titles and captions. A Cultural Impact winner, StoryGraph , uses a machine learning AI to make book recommendations based on your reading data, while another, Be My Eyes , offers an AI assistant that provides visual descriptions of real-world images for blind and low-vision users. And the Apple Watch app of the year, Strava , includes an AI assistant that turns workout data into insights. The company also announced winners for the iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and a standout within its own game subscription service, Apple Arcade.

The firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure. AI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse. For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market. “AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.” Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years. The firm has recorded more than 30 exits to date, including several IPOs, underscoring the depth of its early-stage, long-horizon approach.

The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as HubSpot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S. Formerly known as Sendinblue , Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M. The U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. “That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch. Revenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upward. After joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch. That’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”) These coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to invest €50 million in AI over five years and to use acquisitions (11 to date) as one of its growth levers.

Chu . At WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco, the onetime YouTuber and Crazy Rich Asians director said that working with acts like Justin Bieber taught him the value of connecting with fans online during the creation process. While directing Bieber’s concert film, Never Say Never , in the late aughts, Chu said the then-14-year-old star used Twitter to introduce him to fans. After Bieber posted a clip joking that the director was following him around on set, Chu told WIRED’s senior culture editor, Manisha Krishnan, that he began to watch his online followers grow by tens of thousands of people almost instantly, something that really drove home the power of direct connection with a fanbase. Working with Bieber, Chu said, made him realize that “the story is being told before you even start shooting, and after you’re done with the movie, you have to continue that story.” That’s why he believes fans have felt so invested in Wicked —and its sequel, Wicked: For Good —and why the movie’s marketing and press tours have leaned so heavily on the relationships built by the cast while filming. Bonds, like the one between stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, came from the immense pressure the crew felt to make something not only great, but also bankable. “We only had each other so we’re very, very bonded,” Chu said, likening the relationship to that of Silicon Valley developers working long hours together to deliver a new product.

Authorities identified the man as Brian J. Cole Jr., a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. The arrest marks a major break in a case that has vexed authorities for nearly five years. Cole, 30, is charged with transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, intimidate, or destroy property and with attempting to damage and destroy the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees by means of an explosive device. If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison. According to an affidavit , investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Cole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day. Senior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it. “Though it had been nearly five ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/", "timestamp": 1764880632.0456443}

Today, when Su took the stage at WIRED’s Big Interview conference in San Francisco, she had something else in her sights: the AI bubble . When asked by WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode if the tech industry is in an AI bubble, her response was “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” The AI industry is going to need scores of chips from companies like AMD, and fears of such a bubble, Su said, are “somewhat overstated.” That might sound bold, but boldness is Su’s whole deal. Since she became AMD’s CEO in 2014, she has increased the company’s market cap from $2 billion to $300 billion. Now, Su is betting big on the need for much more computing power for AI, and the data centers needed to provide that. Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead for AMD. One is all of those data centers being built, and another is getting its chips out into the hands of as many customers as possible. During the discussion, Goode asked the AMD CEO about selling chips to China. She confirmed that AMD will pay a 15 percent tax instituted by the Trump administration on MI308 chips it plans to resume shipping to China. The US government previously halted sales of the chips to China, but then began reviewing applications again over the summer. AMD said earlier this year that US export restrictions on the MI308 chips would cost the company roughly $800 million. Earlier this year, AMD made a huge deal with OpenAI, under which the AI company will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct GPUs over the course of several years. As part of the deal, AMD agreed to allow OpenAI to buy 160 million shares of the company’s stock for a penny per share. effectively giving it a 10 percent stake in the company.

Now he wants to sell you phone service—without knowing almost anything about you.", "content": "Nicholas Merrill has spent his career fighting government surveillance . But he would really rather you didn’t call what he’s selling now a “burner phone.” Yes, he dreams of a future where anyone in the US can get a working smartphone—complete with cellular coverage and data—without revealing their identity, even to the phone company. But to call such anonymous phones “burners” suggests that they’re for something illegal, shady, or at least subversive. The term calls to mind drug dealers or deep-throat confidential sources in parking garages. With his new startup, Merrill says he instead wants to offer cellular service for your existing phone that makes near-total mobile privacy the permanent, boring default of daily life in the US. “We're not looking to cater to people doing bad things,” says Merrill. “We're trying to help people feel more comfortable living their normal lives, where they're not doing anything wrong, and not feel watched and exploited by giant surveillance and data mining operations. I think it’s not controversial to say the vast majority of people want that.” That’s the thinking behind Phreeli, the phone carrier startup Merrill launched today, designed to be the most privacy-focused cellular provider available to Americans. Phreeli, as in, “speak freely,” aims to give its user a different sort of privacy from the kind that can be had with end-to-end encrypted texting and calling tools like Signal or WhatsApp . Those apps hide the content of conversations, or even, in Signal’s case, metadata like the identities of who is talking to whom. Phreeli instead wants to offer actual anonymity. It can’t help government agencies or data brokers obtain users’ identifying information because it has almost none to share. The only piece of information the company records about its users when they sign up for a Phreeli phone number is, in fact, a mere ZIP code.

On Monday, DeepSeek released DeepSeek V3.2, another open-weight model that anyone can tinker with. The startup says it performs on par with the latest models from OpenAI and Google, and it even beats them on some key mathematics benchmarks. That same day, ByteDance, whose dominance in AI applications we covered previously, introduced even more ways for people to use its chatbot, Doubao. ByteDance is now working with a Chinese smartphone manufacturer to embed Doubao into the operating system, giving it access to different apps and allowing it to conduct agentic tasks with them. In other words, it’s coming for Apple’s Siri. Both ByteDance and DeepSeek have AI apps with over 140 million monthly users. But their latest announcements represent two diverging trends in China’s AI industry. While some companies are still competing with their Western counterparts to build ever more capable models, others have quietly withdrawn from that game and are focusing on how they can integrate their AI tools into people’s everyday lives. DeepSeek’s latest open-weight model may have disappointed some of its most loyal followers, who are still waiting for R2, a much-anticipated update to the initial model that rocked Silicon Valley in January. Instead, DeepSeek released V3.2 and V3.2-Speciale, which are better-optimized versions of its previous model V3.2-Exp, released in September. Still, V3.2 caused a stir in the AI industry because DeepSeek claims it can solve the type of advanced math questions asked at the International Mathematical Olympiad, and its performance on other coding and reasoning tasks is supposedly on par with or above GPT 5 and Gemini 3. “It suddenly dawned on me why they call the company DeepSeek with the whale as a motif.

While DJI's continual stream of steadily improving, ever-reliable drones almost always impresses, what Antigravity has done with its first-ever product, the A1 , essentially invents an entirely novel subcategory: the 360 drone. Using the same shoot-first, frame-later technology as the Insta360 X5 (Antigravity is technically a distinct company from Insta360, but the brands have close ties ), the A1 has twin cameras to capture everything around it, allowing the user to reframe the footage later using mobile or desktop apps. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 Each of the cameras uses a 1/1.28-inch sensor and an ultrawide lens to capture a hemispherical view. In-camera software then joins the two views into a near-seamless single spherical video, completely removing the drone and its propellers from view (in much the same way Insta360's cameras remove a selfie stick). The 360-degree clips can be as high as 8K and 30 frames per second in resolution, but 5.2K and 4K options are available for users requiring 60 fps or 100 fps frame rates. When output to a standard \"flat\" video, however, the resolution is limited to 4K or 1080p. The camera performs best in bright, clear conditions, and while there's noticeable softening and motion noise in certain parts of the image, getting great-looking clips out of it isn't difficult. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 I think the output video looks very good for an aerial 360 camera, and it's clear that Insta360's know-how from making several generations of non-flying 360 cameras has been put to good use. The footage is easy to edit on both desktop and mobile apps, and although I preferred the former for its UI and the fine level of control it offers over scene trimming and image quality, I enjoyed the immediacy and AI-assisted highlight choices of the mobile app, too.

Zanskar, which uses AI to find hidden geothermal resources deep underground, says that it has identified a new commercially viable site for a potential power plant. The discovery, the company claims, is the first of its kind made by the industry in decades. The find is the culmination of years of research on how to find these resources—and points to the growing promise of geothermal energy . “When we started this company, I think the most common message we heard was that geothermal was dead—it was a history of bones, a graveyard of so many failures,” says Carl Hoiland, a cofounder of Zanskar. “To get to this point where, thanks to these new tools and these new capabilities, you can systematically find these sites and systematically derisk them—we just think this is the first full-scale signal that the tide has turned.” In theory, geothermal power is one of the simplest methods of generating renewable energy. Reservoirs of hot water underground, heated by the Earth’s core, produce steam that can then be used to power turbines at the surface, requiring no excessive mining or complex conversions of fuel. Geothermal resources are especially accessible in areas where tectonic plates meet and the Earth’s crust is thinner, making the western US a great candidate for power plants. The world’s largest developed geothermal field, in California, is built on the site of hot springs that humans have used for thousands of years; the first power plant was built there in the early 1920s . But a big part of the geothermal puzzle is actually finding these resources. It’s rare to find hot springs or vents at the surface that lead to a productive spot to put a power plant. Most geothermal systems that are hot enough to make electricity are deep underground, and there is no evidence at the surface. These are known as hidden or blind systems—and identifying where they are is surprisingly challengin", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/startup-found-hidden-source-geothermal-energy/", "timestamp": 1764880633.106502}

Also known as shooting stars, meteors happen when Earth’s orbital path crosses a path of debris left by a comet and that material burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere. Watching a meteor shower is one of the most accessible ways to engage with the night sky. The next shower are the Geminids, a busy and bright shower that peaks in mid-December, offering the chance to see hundreds of shooting stars each hour. This is just one of nine major meteor showers that grace skies throughout the year, and details of when they will appear in the northern hemisphere are listed below—so mark your 2026 calendar for these. You don’t need any special equipment to see a meteor shower—in fact, using devices like binoculars or telescopes actually prevents you from seeing meteors, because they travel too fast to be seen through the lenses of such equipment. All you need are your eyes, a dark sky with little to no moonlight, and a location that’s away from excess light, as moonlight and light pollution can wash out shooting stars. Note that the moon appears (rises) and disappears (sets) in the night sky at different times depending on what time zone you are in. All moonrise/moonset times in this piece are for the eastern US. You can use tools like Time and Date’s moonrise/moonset calendar or this tool from the US Naval Observatory to check the precise moonrise/moonset times in your exact location. You should allow your eyes about half an hour to adjust to the darkness. If you need to use a flashlight while outside, use one with red light instead of white to preserve your night vision. Each meteor shower is named after its radiant, or the constellation that the shower appears to come from.

Since then, at least six men entered ICE custody after coming into contact with or being detained by LDWF officers. None of the men were issued criminal charges at the time they came into contact with LDWF officers, the documents show.

In response, digital and human rights organization Fight for the Future is hosting a week of events —across Reddit , LinkedIn, and various livestreams —to raise awareness of how it believes these bills are setting a dangerous precedent by making the internet more exploitative rather than safer. Many of the proposed bills include a clause for ID or age verification, which forces people to upload an ID, allow a face scan, or otherwise authenticate that they are not a minor before viewing adult content. Fight for the Future says the policies will lead to increased censorship and surveillance. Among the 19 bills considered at the hearing conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed with sweeping bipartisan approval in the Senate last year, and the Reducing Exploitative Social Media Exposure for Teens Act , which would ban tech companies from allowing minors under the age of 16 on their platforms. In addition to age verification, the bills raised concerns over issues of parental controls, consumer research of minors, AI, and data privacy. “We’re seeing this huge wave toward ID checks being the norm in tech policy, and it felt like we needed to capture the already activated communities who are not feeling heard in Congress,” says Sarah Philips, a campaigner with Fight for the Future. “If you look on YouTube, if you see people making content about KOSA or responding to a lot of this legislation, it’s very unpopular with people.

The game’s developers at Riot Games (a Tencent subsidiary) are using 3D-native AI models to prototype new characters, scenes, and storylines, according to a researcher familiar with the company’s efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. While many AI models can generate text, images, and video, Tencent’s Hunyuan (混元 or “first mix”) family of models can dream up 3D objects and interactive scenes. The source says that Tencent’s models are also being used by the developers of another Tencent game, GKART , and by some independent developers, too. Tencent declined to comment. “The games industry requires a lot of investment,” the source says. “Previously you would need a month to design a character. Now you can just type in some text, and Hunyuan can give you four choices in 60 seconds.” The news is an early signal that models capable of understanding and re-creating the physical world could become a standard ingredient in game design. In addition to generating game content, these models could also enable more advanced virtual and augmented reality and help robots learn to do new things. “There’s a real explosion of 3D vision research nowadays,” says Alexander Raistrick , a graduate student at Princeton University working on novel approaches to generating 3D content. “There are many killer applications: There's content creation, there’s self driving, and there’s a whole stack of problems involved in augmented reality.” Raistrick adds that video games are an obvious application for 3D AI models. “Outputting 3D meshes [a standard way of representing 3D objects] is your typical kind of bread and butter of game development,” he says. But, as in other creative fields, using AI to create video games is controversial. Concerns about AI-fueled job loss loom large .

But some immigrants say it’s been nearly impossible.", "content": "A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport . The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims. Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure. She says the call never came. This isn’t what’s supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home , which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug.

According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees.

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says.

Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data. The stakes are high for AWS to get this right. While Amazon’s cloud unit dominated the smartphone era, smaller rivals like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have grown at higher rates since the arrival of ChatGPT. Microsoft and Google have surged by tightly integrating with frontier AI models—the technology underlying", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-aws-ceo-matt-garman-ai-agents/", "timestamp": 1764880637.5928104}

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Melinda French Gates, welcome to The Big Interview . Thank you so much for being here. MELINDA FRENCH GATES: Thanks for having me, Katie. So we always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. It's a warmup. Get your brain working, get your muscles working. Are you ready? I am ready. OK, first thing you do when you wake up in the morning. Get my coffee.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine , Gavin Kliger , Marko Elez , Akash Bobba , and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment. The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers , consolidating data across agencies , and importing private sector practices —remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles. “That’s absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-doge-doing-now/", "timestamp": 1764880638.0847883}

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

Calling the moment “a great day for Africa, a great day for the world,” Trump declared, “Today, we’re succeeding where so many others have failed.” The deal, finalized in Washington after months of mediation, follows a preliminary pact signed in June and is being described by the White House as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The ceremony gave Trump another opportunity to present himself as a global dealmaker and revive his long-standing claim that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. The event took place just days after he made disparaging comments about Somalia, remarks that drew criticism across the African continent. Trump met individually with Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, before holding a trilateral session. Despite the diplomatic triumph, fighting continues on the ground. Eastern Congo remains engulfed in conflict involving more than 100 armed groups, including the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who recently captured the key cities of Goma and Bukavu. The escalation has deepened one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with millions displaced. Trump frequently claims his mediation “ended the conflict.” But, both leaders expressed cautious optimism. Kagame said, “No one was asking President Trump to take up this task… But when the president saw the opportunity to contribute to peace, he immediately took it.” Tshisekedi added, “I do believe this day is the beginning of a new path… a path where peace will not just be a wish, an aspiration, but a turning point.” A central pillar of the agreement is economic cooperation.

Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to hold a meeting with Putin at Hyderabad House on Friday, 5 December. Here's a glimpse at the Russian president's itinerary for tomorrow: Vladimir Putin's visit to the nation comes at a time when India has been under sustained pressure from the US to scale back its purchases of Russian crude. Trump, recently, has also claimed that India has cut down its oil purchases from Russia following tariffs imposed by the US. Washington imposed a 50% tariff on all Indian goods, including 25% levies for New Delhi's procurement of Russian crude oil. On Thursday, Putin, referring to Western sanctions against Moscow – in an interview with India Today – said his country's energy cooperation with New Delhi largely \"remains unaffected\". \"As for India's purchase of energy resources from Russia, I would like to note and have already mentioned publicly this once, the United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants,\" Putin said in the interview. He further praised Modi , stating that\"Prime Minister Modi is not someone who succumbs to pressure easily.\" India's Russian oil purchases have been in focus as the US imposed sanctions in October on Rosneft and Lukoil, two of Russia's largest oil producers, with the aim of cutting Kremlin's resources to fund the Ukraine war. India continued to be the second-largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels in October , after China – as per a report by an European think tank – which cited the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has clarified that exposures of an Indian branch of a foreign bank to its head office or any overseas branches or subsidiaries must be treated as regular counterparty exposures and brought under Large Exposures Framework (LEF) limits, according to the amendments announced on Thursday. Earlier, such exposures were often interpreted as falling under an exemption clause. The RBI also mandated that all transactions between foreign bank branches in India and their head office or overseas branches must be computed on a gross basis, regardless of whether they are centrally cleared. This prevents netting and ensures a conservative assessment of risks. The changes come into effect from 1 April 2026, though banks may adopt them earlier, RBI said. The updated rules, which follow feedback on draft circulars released on 29 September, aim to ensure consistent measurement of concentration risk and align the framework with evolving bank structures and global practices. The final amendments remove ambiguities in the treatment of foreign bank exposures, the central bank said in a press release. Exposure limits have also been refined. For Indian branches of foreign globally systematic important banks (G-SIBs), the exposure limit to their head office or other such banks will be 20% of eligible tier I capital, while exposures to non-G-SIB banks will be capped at 25%. For branches of foreign non-G-SIB banks, the limits are reversed, with 25% for exposures to the head office and other non-G-SIBs, and 20% for exposures to G-SIBs.

Australia's lithium, copper, nickel and cobalt are helping power India's manufacturing ambitions, Hill, assistant minister for international education, citizenship, customs, multicultural affairs, said on Thursday at India-Australia Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese launched a new roadmap for ties with India earlier this year, which identifies four sectors, clean energy, agribusiness, education and skilling, and tourism, he said. \"It (the roadmap) identifies four sectors, or superhighways, which we think are most prospective. One, clean energy. That's Australian critical minerals helping to power India's manufacturing ambitions in renewables. Australia produces over half the world's lithium and we have the world's second largest reserves of nickel, copper and cobalt,\" said the assistant minister. India aims to scale up manufacturing in strategic sectors such as renewable energy and clean mobility. The two countries united on the critical minerals front in July, when as members of the Quad alliance, they launched a Quad Critical Minerals Initiative, pledging to work together to secure and diversify supply chains.

The Sberbank chief's remarks came as a Russian delegation led by President Vladimir Putin is in New Delhi on a 2-day visit starting Thursday. Gref has served as Russia's trade and economy minister during 2000-2007, and has headed the state-run bank thereafter. He said that the state-run lender recently launched an instrument for private Russian investors to invest in Nifty50 companies. Nifty50 is a stock market index that represents the float-weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. \"We launched (an instrument) three days ago. We launched a special instrument for the private investors in Russia (to get) the opportunity to invest in Nifty50 index. And what we see, it would be a good opportunity for the Russian companies, for the Russian private people to invest in India,” he said, adding that enabling Russian private investments would help generate more interest among those investors for Indian companies. Russia’s move comes at a time when rupees worth billions of dollars are sitting idle in Indian banks. This build-up has happened because Western sanctions in the wake of Ukraine war made it harder for Russia to use dollars or euros for trade, forcing Moscow to settle more transactions with New Delhi in the Indian currency. Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, processes about 65–70% of India’s exports to Russia and 10–15% of Russia’s exports to India. The two countries now have $68.7 billion in total bilateral trade.

In the room was a blackboard, which had several words scribbled on it: \"political,\", \"plots,\" \"deception,\" \"power,\" and \"truth\" were among them, as was \"music\". Some of these words were underlined like \"music\", while others had lines connecting them. Some other words written on the board, however, were not decipherable.

The dozens of photos released by Democrats give people a fairly detailed view of Epstein's island home, from aerial shots showing the sprawling mansion to views leading up to the house. Several photos also show the interiors and decor of the convicted child sex offender's mansion, with various paintings and sculptures visible. Some sculptures were in the Greco-Roman style, while some were in other styles. A few busts too were found in the mansion. One peculiar photo showed a room with a dentist's chair in the middle, while the walls were adorned with masks. A framed photo released as part of the files also showed Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell meeting Pope John Paul II. Yet another photos showed a landline photo with some names listed on speed dial.

This initiative aims to curb fake hallmarking and strengthen consumer confidence.", "content": "New Delhi: Within the first three months of introducing mandatory hallmark unique identification (HUID) for silver, more than 1.6 million pieces have already been hallmarked, reflecting strong uptake among jewellers and growing confidence among consumers, the consumer affairs ministry said in a statement on Thursday. While silver hallmarking itself remains voluntary, the government has made HUID compulsory for any silver article that is hallmarked, marking a major push to curb fake hallmarking and strengthen purity assurance. HUID is a unique six-digit alphanumeric code laser-marked on each hallmarked gold or silver item to ensure complete digital traceability and purity verification. As per the consumer affairs ministry, the early response shows strong acceptance of the nationwide rollout of mandatory HUID-based hallmarking for silver jewellery and artefacts from 1 September 2025. Trends in silver hallmarking show the southern region of the country leading in volume of hallmarking, followed by the western and eastern regions. Purity grades 925 and 800 account for nearly 90% of all hallmarked pieces, with the southern region leading in volumes, it said. “The sharp rise follows a broader push to introduce full digital traceability in the precious metals sector. Consumers can verify authenticity instantly through the BIS CARE app, which displays purity, item type, jeweller details and the assaying centre involved,” it said. The BIS Care app is a mobile application launched by the the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) that helps consumers to check product authenticity and lodge complaints. Early hallmarking trends show payals and anklets dominating the list, mostly in 800 purity, followed by silver diyas, plates, idols and coins. Almost all idols are hallmarked at 925 purity, while 99% of coins are at 990 purity. The 800 purity means the silver item is made of 80% pure silver, while 925 purity means it is made of 92.5% pure silver (commonly known as sterling silver).

The minister noted that India’s total tax on tobacco products remains below the World Health Organization’s (WHO) benchmark and emphasized that the government does not plan to lower taxes on this so-called “sin good.” Under the new regime, tobacco products will attract the highest goods and services tax (GST) rate of 40%, up from the current 28%, she explained. With the GST compensation cess being replaced by the proposed Health Security and National Security cess, and the continued levy of central excise duty, the overall tax incidence on tobacco is expected to remain largely the same. These items are not taxed in India at World Health Organisation’s (WHO) benchmark taxation level, Sitharaman said. “WHO has affordability index of tobacco products. They monitor the price range and point out where it is below the benchmark,” the minister said, adding that lower tax does not help to disincentivise tobacco consumption. “India’s total tax incidence on tobacco is 53% of the retail price, which is substantially below the WHO benchmark of 75%.” “There is no change in tax incidence on bidi. Considering that the people who roll bidi come from a lower economic strata in the country, we have made sure that nothing goes to hurt the livelihood of the bidi rollers,” she said, while also referring to the existing schemes for their welfare. “The current scheme of taxation will continue till the end of this month, which has been in place since 2017,” Sitharaman said.

As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764880720.77015}
