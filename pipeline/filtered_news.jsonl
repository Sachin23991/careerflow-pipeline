While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits. Goa marks the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in early December, a major religious observance that can lead to localised school holidays. In Gujarat, the Rann Utsav continues through the month, prompting academic exc", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/school-colleges-holidays-in-december-2025-new-year-christmas-rann-ustav-10391573/", "timestamp": 1764520260.4140306}

The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government. He announced that reforms to address long-standing issues faced by ad hoc and SSA teachers are nearing completion and could be implemented in the next financial year. The program also included participation from thousands of students virtually joining from 200 locations across the state.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities.

Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends.

The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost. A recent report by The Indian Express shows that 93 per cent of London businesses say international talent helps address skills shortages, and 84 per cent believe internatio", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indian-students-highest-cohort-leaving-united-kingdom-immigration-rule-limits-intake-ons-data-10390931/", "timestamp": 1764520266.1074133}

From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021. Underlining the relevance of a single higher education regulator, the NEP-2020 document says, “The regulatory system needs a complete overhaul to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.” It adds that the new system should ensure the distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting are ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/winter-session-parliament-to-take-up-bill-replacing-ugc-aicte-ncte-with-single-regulator-10381204/", "timestamp": 1764520281.271895}

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764520301.371307}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.

Cookie — who is Black — changed her profile avatar to a white man and asked the Perplexity model if it was ignoring her instructions because she was a woman . Its response shocked her. It said that it didn’t think she, as a woman, could “possibly understand quantum algorithms, Hamiltonian operators, topological persistence, and behavioral finance well enough to originate this work,” according to saved chat logs seen by TechCrunch. “I saw sophisticated quantum algorithm work,” it told her. “I saw it on an account with a traditionally feminine presentation. My implicit pattern-matching triggered ‘this is implausible,’ so I created an elaborate reason to doubt it, which created a secondary bias — if she can’t defend it, it’s not real.” When we asked Perplexity for comment on this conversation, a spokesperson told us: “We are unable to verify these claims, and several markers indicate they are not Perplexity queries.” The conversation left Cookie aghast, but it did not surprise AI researchers. They warned that two things were going on. First, the underlying model, trained to be socially agreeable, was simply answering her prompt by telling her what it thought she wanted to hear. “We do not learn anything meaningful about the model by asking it,” Annie Brown, an AI researcher and founder of the AI infrastructure company Reliabl, told TechCrunch. The second is that the model was probably biased.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.

Three experts offered their insights at TechCrunch Disrupt.", "content": "For years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market. “You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler , general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month. The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld , vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added. Marc Manara , head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it. “There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.” Specifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past.

And the fight that’s brewing isn’t about the technology, it’s about who gets to do the regulating. In the absence of a meaningful federal AI standard that focuses on consumer safety, states have introduced dozens of bills to protect residents against AI-related harms, including California’s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act, which prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems. The tech giants and buzzy startups born out of Silicon Valley argue such laws create an unworkable patchwork that threatens innovation. “It’s going to slow us in the race against China,” Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, told TechCrunch. The industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all. In the trenches of that all-or-nothing battle, new efforts have emerged to prohibit states from enacting their own AI legislation. House lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI. A sweeping preemption that would take away states’ rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year. Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight. To create that national standard, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk. A megabill such as this will likely take months, if not years, to become law, underscoring why the current rush to li", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/", "timestamp": 1764521428.0834115}

Although the iPad started off as a device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into computers that can handle a variety of different tasks for personal, work, and school use. As a result, there are numerous apps to help you do things like create a single place to organize your life or help you stay focused on your day-to-day tasks by blocking out distractions. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best ones that are available on the App Store. Goodnotes is one of the most popular iPad apps , and for good reason. The app is great for people who like to write out notes using an Apple Pencil ; you can include both handwritten and typed text on one page and add things like images, stickers, and even doodles. You can create a digital notebook with blank or ruled paper for notes, checklists, planners, and more. The app lets you export entire digital notebooks or specific pages into PDFs and other files. Goodnotes is also great for drawing and sketching. While it’s not as advanced as some creativity apps like Procreate, Goodnotes is easy to use and perfect for quick sketches or diagrams. If you’re attending a class or a meeting, you can also record audio notes that are synced to the moment you write. Plus, you can use AI to summarize your notes and help you write. You can create three digital notebooks for free. If you want unlimited notebooks, you’ll have to pay $9.99 per year or a one-time fee of $29.99.

The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.) As for all that customer demand, Burry has basically proposed it’s a mirage because AI cu", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/", "timestamp": 1764521429.8808308}

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained. According to Obateru, the platform, which has 47,000 users, relies on an AI he c", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/justiguide-wants-to-use-ai-to-help-people-navigate-the-u-s-immigration-system/", "timestamp": 1764521432.9063344}

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse. Edelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns. “OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/", "timestamp": 1764521433.4964006}

Nevada-based Redwood employees around 1,200 employees, so the cuts affect a few dozen workers. The company, founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, initially focused on recycling scrap from battery cell production, consumer electronics, and used EV batteries. The company extracts materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium from those discarded goods and then sells them back to its customers, which include Panasonic. Redwood has since added cathode production. It recently launched a new business that uses those old EV batteries in energy storage products — a sector that has taken off during the boom of power-hungry AI data centers. As of June, the company had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of batteries for this purpose. The $350 million Series E, announced in October, boosted the company’s valuation to around $6 billion, as TechCrunch previously reported . A spokesperson declined to comment on the layoffs.

With an RTX 5060, you probably won't do a whole lot of gaming at native resolution, but if you also want to use your laptop for watching videos, studying, or work, the sharper display of the Alienware laptop is a nice upgrade.

I do have one now, thanks to you guys, and I keep it in my backpack when I'm hiking with my kids, even when I'm also carrying water bottles . It sucks to be thirsty!

This post has been updated to reflect the time left as of 9 am EST on Sunday. When's the last time you poured a perfect glass of Pinot Noir in your own home? If you're like me from three weeks ago, probably never. Red wines should be served somewhere between 58 and 68 degrees (opinions vary). That's a bit cooler than room temperature, but unless you want to dedicate money and space to a special refrigerator, you don't have many good options. Our colleagues at Bon Appétit have, in fact, advocated giving up on life and just keeping your red wine in the fridge and then pulling the bottle out about a half hour before you plan to drink. Enter the Rocco, which will hold your Gamay at a perfect 58 degrees on a lower shelf while holding your Stella Artois at a perfect 38 degrees a few shelves below. (I used a wireless thermometer to check the temperatures on various shelves; they were dead-on.) Did I mention it's gorgeous? In a world of wine fridges that look like Holiday Inn minibars and mini gridges that look like they came out of a dorm, the design-forward Rocco has a distinctive look that's also neutral enough to fit into rooms with midcentury and modern furniture. And did I mention it's $500 off for the next 5ish hours ? With, as of publication time, free shipping.  Rocco The “smart fridge” branding is perhaps a bit of bluster. Other than the design, which is incredibly thoughtful and flexible (there's room for both cans and 750 millilitre bottles), it has an app-based lock, and can allow you to prioritise chilling over volume for when it's being opened constantly (Party mode) or be quiet in your home theater (Quiet mode). There are other things the app is supposed to do, but I've had no luck getting the fridge connected so far—a common problem it seems . There is no Android version of the app, and it also doesn't work with older Macs, but my iPhone 15 Pro Max and M1 laptop also failed to connect after more than an hour of tryi", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/you-have-8-hours-to-save-on-this-stunning-smart-fridge/", "timestamp": 1764521436.940361}

In fact, a giant box is staring at me right now, demanding I film the unboxing and set up of the newest automatic litter box I've received. Because I test so many, I have a lot of opinions. Although there are AI-enabled models with built-in cameras , I still think the best model for most people is the Petkit PuraMax 2 .

I recommend it to those who aren't full-on insane helicopter cat parents, but want a cheaper model than some of our other picks. It's easy to use, compact, and actually smells great. It's especially good for neat freaks like me: with triple odor control, a sealed waste bin, an odor eliminator attachment that sits in the waste bin, and a citrusy deodorizing spray that goes off after every cleaning and randomly throughout the day to ensure the litter box stays fresh. When the cat enters the box, their weight is displayed on the front for easier viewing, and the app logs every time it was used, for how long, when the cleaning cycle begins, ends, and when the deodorizing spray was emitted. Plus, if you don't want to be reliant on the app to change settings or start a manual cycle, pet parents can also change settings manually via the buttons on the front. After testing so many of these, I notice their quirks. Many boxes I test don't rotate upward, and so filling with clean litter can be cramped and awkward.

But when that will happen—and how fast—is anything but settled.", "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine . In May 2014, NASA announced at a press conference that a portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appeared to have reached a point of irreversible retreat. Glaciers flowing toward the sea at the periphery of the 2-kilometer-thick sheet of ice were losing ice faster than snowfall could replenish them, causing their edges to recede inland. With that, the question was no longer whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would disappear, but when. When those glaciers go, sea levels will rise by more than a meter, inundating land currently inhabited by 230 million people . And that would be just the first act before the collapse of the entire ice sheet, which could raise seas 5 meters and redraw the world’s coastlines. At the time, scientists assumed that the loss of those glaciers would unfold over centuries. But in 2016, a bombshell study in Nature concluded that crumbling ice cliffs could trigger a runaway process of retreat, dramatically hastening the timeline. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) took notice, establishing a sobering new worst-case scenario: By 2100, meltwater from Antarctica, Greenland, and mountain glaciers combined with the thermal expansion of seawater could raise global sea levels by over 2 meters . And that would only be the beginning. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, seas would rise a staggering 15 meters by 2300. However, not all scientists are convinced by the runaway scenario. Thus, a tension has emerged over how long we have until West Antarctica’s huge glaciers vanish. If their retreat unfolds over centuries, humanity may have time to adapt. But if rapid destabilization begins in the coming decades through the controversial runaway process, the consequences could outpace our ability to respond. Scientists warn that major population centers—New York City, New Orleans, Miami and Houston—may not be ready. “We’ve definitely not ruled this out,” said Karen ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-oceans-are-going-to-rise-but-when/", "timestamp": 1764521437.3358178}

China controls the vast majority of the market—and that’s not changing any time soon.", "content": "The alarm hasn't yet reached the general public, but tension is beginning to build in the corridors of the aerospace industry, in microchip laboratories, and in government offices. For months, an element almost invisible to the world—yttrium—has become the silent center of a new global dispute. Supplies are thinning, prices are skyrocketing, deliveries are stalling. And while China and the United States have promised a truce over rare earth minerals , the wheels of advanced technology are beginning to slow. Although a late-October meeting in South Korea between Chinese president Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump raised hopes for a détente, the Chinese export restrictions introduced last April remain substantially in place. Beijing granted a one-year reprieve on the mandatory government licensing system for shipments of rare earths and products containing related materials (including those made abroad with at least 0.1 percent Chinese resources), in exchange for a similar suspension of the White House's latest restrictions on technology supply chains. But other measures introduced before the latest escalation remain in place. The result is a tightening of the international supply chain that threatens to slow advanced technological production, raise costs, and challenge entire industrial sectors. Yttrium plays a crucial role in the functioning of contemporary technologies. Without yttrium, the production of aircraft engines, high-efficiency turbines, advanced energy systems, and semiconductors would immediately slow down. Yttrium's value lies in its ability to impart thermal and mechanical strength to materials subjected to extreme temperatures. Jet engines blades, for example, must withstand prolonged overheating and intense vibration; yttrium is what allows them to maintain structural integrity and efficiency.

Studies have repeatedly shown that people with vulvas need clitoral stimulation to orgasm, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the first clitoral suction toy hit the market. These days, many suction toys (also called clit suckers) have been designed by the people using them. That's how it should be. I've tested dozens of suction toys solo and during partner play with people of various gender identities, genitals, and sexual desires. We’ve explored all erogenous zones, direct contact on favorable spots, and enjoyed every one of the vibration patterns and sonic waves that came our way. Based on extensive research, these are the cream of that particular crop, the absolute best clitoral suction toys right now, some of which double as clitoral vibrators and massagers when you’re feeling saucy enough to spice it up.

Clitoral suction toys can be a bit of a mystery if you're unfamiliar with their ins and outs. Vibrators have motors that deliver vibrations for stimulation, but a suction toy is a little more complex. They work by modulating air pressure with an internal diaphragm. They all have a mouthpiece, and inside that mouthpiece is a (typically) silicone membrane that an internal motor moves in and out. When you press the mouthpiece against your body, it traps the air, keeping it from escaping. The movement of the membrane uses that air to create modulating high and low air pressure. Those changes in air pressure enable the sucking sensation that these toys are famous for.

It wasn't until I started testing chef's knives earlier this year that I realized how important it is to invest a little bit in the tool you'll most likely be using every day for years (or even decades if you keep up with maintenance). I didn't realize that using a cheap, very dull knife as my daily driver was slowing down my cooking process, making less effective cuts, and even putting me at risk of injury, as the blade was dull and caused me to apply more pressure (which in turn made things more dangerous). I'm a believer in the importance of investing in A Good-Ass Knife. Plus, they make seriously wonderful presents. Every kitchen (and home chef) needs a solid chef's knife to slice, dice, and chop ingredients with speed and precision. Most people get knife sets ( which I think are baloney, BTW ) for wedding presents and then slack on proper maintenance, causing the knives to dull and degrade quickly. Chances are, the person you're shopping for this holiday season (even if it's yourself!) needs a better go-to knife for their kitchen.

Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids.

Last year's Vision Pro is widely considered to be one of the company's biggest flops, and the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch was marred by the fact that the Apple Watch did not then have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent infringement lawsuit . But this year, Apple is back, baby! The thin, light iPhone Air was a huge redesign, the Apple Watch 's extended battery life was a long-overdue upgrade, and the AirPods Pro 3 are better than ever. Now, we get Apple Black Friday Deals. If you've just discovered that your trusty old Apple Watch or AirPods have died, there has never been a better time to upgrade.

Apple finally upgraded the Watch SE after many years, and it now has the latest S10 chip, which means that it can run all the WatchOS 26 updates, like the new Liquid Glass display, Workout Buddy, and wrist-flick gestures.

The S25 is the smallest, the S25+ gets a few extra perks plus a bigger screen and better battery life, but it's the Galaxy S25 Ultra that really steps things up, with a dual telephoto camera system, integrated S Pen stylus, and a beefy battery.

Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store This is my top recommendation for most people in my Best Office Chairs guide . There are dozens of cheaper chairs on the market, but it's hard to find an option under $500 that's comfortable and highly adjustable while also being attractive and offering various style options (Branch now even offers it with bouclé upholstery). The headrest is optional—I don't think you need it—but you can adjust the seat depth, the lumbar support can be aligned and pushed inward, and you can tilt the seat forward, too. Branch Branch Amazon On a tight budget? You won't find a better chair at this $300 mark. The Ergonomic Chair has many of the same adjustment points as the Pro, including seat depth, and has a similar design. Some of those finer adjustments aren't available, like pushing in the lumbar or the upright seat tilt.

It’s usually good advice to buy whatever the latest release of a tech product is, especially if you're looking for the best Black Friday or Cyber Monday MacBook deal .

Updated November 29: We've added some accessory deals and vetted prices. That might come as a surprise coming from me, especially since my evaluation of the M5 MacBook Pro was quite positive . There’s a lot to like about it. The M5's performance is a solid step up over the M4 , especially in the GPU department. The stuff that hasn’t changed is still really high-quality, including the Mini-LED display, excellent speakers, and iconic design. It’s been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect.

The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That’s a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows.

All you have to do is register your kit, set up an account and your pet's profile, swab your pet's mouth, send it back in the self-addressed packet, and in about five weeks, results will show up in your email and online account. Then, perhaps best of all, you can send them to your vet so they can access your pet's data to ensure they have the most up-to-date health information for the next vet visit or (dog forbid!) emergency trip. I compared Basepaws against Wisdom Panel , the other most popular at-home test kit for pets, and while I liked Wisdom Panel's interface a bit more, Basepaws had a lot more health information. This is especially the case for cats: Basepaws was able to tell me my cats' blood type and transfusion risk—super helpful information for my vet to have, especially in an emergency or surgery situation. I found the oral health report to be extremely helpful, too—both of my cats have halitosis and are at risk for dental disease.

The trench swings open, and you can let water out via the button and put it back into the bottle by tilting it and holding the button. I like that you can hold it while your pup drinks, or lay it flat on the ground like a bowl. There’s a nice strap to grab it from, and there’s the option to add the company’s charcoal filters if you’re worried about water quality. (You don’t need to use the filters.)

In fact, in recent years, some of the most high-profile and brazen digital attacks around the world have been carried out by teens. But even if you're not a hacker, you’re probably still a prolific user of digital tools and social platforms. And whether you've never given much thought to your digital privacy and security or you've started to rein in your data, you can use this guide to implement basic precautions and keep operations security in mind. In other words, this guide contains advice and ideas to help you conceptualize how people can find out information about you from your digital activities—and start to minimize what’s out there in ways you didn’t intend. Protecting your digital privacy isn't a blanket prescription. Some people are more private by nature, and others prioritize putting themselves out there. But even if you're a 24/7 streamer, you can still think about your operations security, commonly known as opsec. What can viewers see in your room while you're streaming? Which people from your life have appeared onscreen? Could viewers figure out where you live from what they can see out your window? These same types of questions can be adapted for any type of onlooker—from the tech companies that operate the platforms you use to people browsing your social media or dating profiles or a friend (FORMER FRIEND) looking over your shoulder at your phone. In digital operations security, “operations” are the things that make up online activity like messages, searches, AI chats, websites, photos, accounts, passwords, and so on. The “security” piece has two goals. One is secrecy: No one sees stuff they shouldn’t. The other is availability: You don’t lose access to your data and accounts. Opsec is hard, because secrecy and availability conflict. The more secret you make things, the easier it is to accidentally lock yourself out and vice versa. Good security is a balance. It's worth saying, though, that opsec is not", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/digital-opsec-for-teens/", "timestamp": 1764521443.3068554}

Who wouldn't want a little color splashed on the paperlike screen, giving a feeling of a real page? These color e-readers can do everything a regular e-reader can, but they let you see your book covers and illustrations in their full glory and add colorful highlights to the pages of your latest read. Some even let you write colored notes on the pages or in the digital notebook built within it. It makes for a really fun experience, especially if you're a book-annotator type of person (I aspire to be such a person, but I usually lose steam halfway through a good book) or love graphic novels. I've tried several color e-readers and e-paper devices in my testing , and as I compare overall features and value, I've found myself impressed again and again with the value of Kobo's color e-readers. Whether that's the larger Kobo Libra Colour, our favorite all-around e-reader that can double as a digital notebook, or the affordable Kobo Clara Colour, you can't go wrong with Kobo's colorful devices. From a simple glance, most color e-readers look pretty similar. You'll usually see a 150 pixels-per-inch resolution for color and 300 for black-and-white, which are specs we see for both Kobo’s and Kindle’s color devices. Kobo's two color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and the Kobo Clara Colour, use E Ink Kaleido 3 technology to power their colorful screens. This technology has 16 levels of grayscale and 4,096 colors, allowing it to represent hues from your favorite books with ease. You'll see higher resolution for the black-and-white technology, since that's still the main base that color e-readers use; the lower-resolution colors are essentially a top-layer effect. So even though the color is lower resolution, you shouldn't notice a lower resolution overall.

That's where “Find my phone” capability comes in handy. Just ask a nearby family member or friend to use the feature built into their phone’s OS to ping the lost device, and it makes a loud noise that helps you find it. The problem: not everyone uses the same phone operating system. In my house, I have an iPhone and my wife has an Android . This means when I inevitably leave my phone in a hotel couch, she can't really help me find it. Sure, she could call my phone number, but I usually have my ringer off and Do Not Disturb enabled. (I'm annoying like that.) She obviously can't use Apple’s Find My iPhone, which doesn’t run on her Android device. And while both Apple and Google offer tools to see the location of paired devices from a computer, the computer that's nearby may not be set up with the proper permissions. Am I doomed to keep track of where my phone is, like a functional adult? No, thanks to a simple app called RingIt by Belgian developer Gaëtan Van Den Berge . This application, which is free for both Android and iOS, exists to make it easier for Android users to help iPhone users find their phone, and vice-versa. Just open the app, hit a button, and the other person's phone will ring—loudly—helping them to find their phone. \"The idea for RingIt actually came to me on vacation with my girlfriend,\" Van Den Berge tells me. \"I kept misplacing my phone, often while it was on silent, and I’d repeatedly ask her, 'Do you know where my phone is?' I remember thinking how nice it would be if she could just make my phone ring loudly from her own device, even if mine was muted.\" And so he made an application that does exactly this, and nothing else. The application doesn't collect location or any user data—just email addresses that are used for verification. Setting up the application is easy: just install the app on your phone.

Even folks who have yet to dip their toe into the sex toy world have heard about the best vibrators and the innovation sex tech has brought us this century. Originally, they were merely crude dildos that just happened to vibrate. Thankfully, that’s no longer the case. As a deeper understanding of the human anatomy has come to light, vibrators are designed to transcend archaic stereotypes about what sexual pleasure should be. Vibrators today come in all shapes and sizes. Some look more like art than something that makes you go weak in the knees. What’s most important remains: These are sex toys that use internal motors to stimulate erogenous zones. Yes, zones plural; vibrators aren't just for vulvas. Phalluses and nipples also respond well to stimulation with the right rumbly sensations, as do the perineum, the insides of the thighs, and even the lower abdomen and nape of the neck. Most of the vibrators on this list have been tested on vulvas, phalluses, and the extensive network of erogenous zones all over the body.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive. We remain positive on Hatsun due to competitive advantages such as established brands, distribution and direct milk procurement. We marginally raise FY25E and FY26E earnings by 0.4% and 3.3%, respectively.

He made the remarks on Nikhil Kamath’s “People by WTF” podcast, where the two discussed the shifting narrative around migration into the US. Kamath noted that for decades, the US attracted “really smart people,” including many Indian-origin professionals. Musk strongly agreed, saying: “America has benefitted immensely from talented Indians that have come to America.” When Kamath pointed out that this trend “seems to be changing now,” Musk reiterated: “America has been [an] immense beneficiary of talent from India.” Kamath asked why the US now appears more anti-immigration, even recounting his own anxiety at US immigration: “I passed through immigration and I was worried whether I would be stopped.” Musk said the shift stems from political divides and the recent surge in illegal immigration. “There are different schools of thought. It’s not unanimous,” he said. He criticised the Biden administration’s approach: “Under the Biden administration, it was basically a total free-for-all with no border controls… You had massive amounts of illegal immigration.” He argued that generous government benefits create “a diffusion gradient” drawing more undocumented migrants. Musk said both political extremes contribute to the tension: The left, he said, wants “open borders, no holds barred,” even if migrants have criminal backgrounds. The right believes that immigrants take away American jobs, though Musk questioned this: “My direct observation is that there is always a scarcity of talented people… More talented people would be good.” He added that companies sometimes prefer cheaper foreign workers, feeding public resentment. Musk said there are flaws in the system: “There has been some misuse of the H-1B program … Some outsourcing companies have kind of gamed the system.” But he warned against ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/elon-musk-says-us-has-benefitted-immensely-from-indian-talent-calls-out-h1-b-system-misuse-on-nikhil-kamath-s-podcast-11764517721541.html", "timestamp": 1764521497.843047}

According to ABC News, at least 450 flights had been canceled across the United States as of 7 a.m. ET Sunday (November 30), with Chicago’s O’Hare Airport experiencing the largest disruptions. The news outlet citing flight tracker FlightAware stated that there were 179 cancellations at O’Hare early Sunday, including 110 departures. The airport reportedly faced even greater impacts on Saturday, with more than a thousand flights delayed or canceled due to the storm. ABC News reported that O’Hare recorded approximately 8.4 inches of snow up to midnight Saturday, surpassing the previous record for the snowiest November day of 8.0 inches, set on November 6, 1951. Across the Chicago metro area, snowfall ranged from 7 to 10 inches as of Sunday morning.

The MRM's national convenor, S K Muddin, in a statement, said Muslims enjoy full Constitutional rights and security in the country. Madani had on Saturday alleged that efforts were being made in the country to establish the supremacy of one group through actions like bulldozer action, mob lynching, weakening of the Muslim Waqf and Islamic reforms. He also claimed that the perception that courts were working under government pressure had grown following the Babri Masjid verdict and many other decisions. Reacting to the remarks, Muddin, the former chairman of the MP Madarsa Board, said that Muslims were \"most secure\" in India compared to any other country and described the country as \"riot-free\" today. Prohibitory orders were rarely imposed now, whereas before 2014, newspapers and television channels carried daily reports of riots, he claimed. Muddin said that Madani had failed to acknowledge that Muslim sons and daughters were serving the country in the armed forces, security agencies and other key institutions. The JUH chief had also said: \"With regret, it has to be said that organised efforts are being made to establish the supremacy of a particular group and making other groups legally helpless, socially isolated and economically disgraced, defamed and deprived\". Muddin said statements made by leaders like Madani had pushed Muslims behind in the race for progress since Independence. He said \"Vande Mataram\" was the national song and reciting it was not against Islam, as it salutes the motherland. Praising one's soil, he said, was part of a Muslim's faith.

He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability. The Foreign Office, in a press release, said that “like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan”. “While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” it said.

Influencers have started filming themselves tasting it. The dish has long been a staple in impoverished settlements in the Philippines, where families rely on it as a low-cost source of protein. It is made from discarded leftovers that are cleaned and cooked again. Its roots date back to the 1960s, when economic hardship prompted many people to migrate to crowded cities. Scavengers search for food scraps early each morning. Then, they sell them to small vendors. These vendors chop the pieces, add spices, and deep-fry everything to create a filling meal. For many households, the low cost of 20-30 pesos (under ₹ 150) makes it the only option they can afford. However, the viral videos have become a point of controversy. The controversy started with Chinese travel influencer Baozou Brother. With over 6.5 million followers, the vlogger posted a video trying the “second-hand fried chicken” in some poor areas of the Philippines, the South China Morning Post reported. His video went viral. He admitted that, even though the taste was ‘acceptable’, the idea behind the dish made it hard for him to eat it. Another Chinese influencer , known as “20 and still haven’t been to Starbucks”, also tried it. He mentally prepared himself by imagining he had gone hungry for days. “After all, I am a lifestyle experience blogger, and I have to do what I say. Locals really do eat this stuff. Look at this piece of meat, only half is left. I am just going to imagine that I have been in a desert for 10 days and nights and have no food to eat,” SCMP quoted him as saying. While eating, a few local children joined him. They all shared the food. He ended his video by pointing out the harsh reality. “This is the inequality of the world.

Speaking to PTI, Chandran noted that India is undergoing a “rapid demographic transition”, with birth rate set to drop sharply over the past 20 years. He added, “In 2000, our TFR was 3.5 and today it stands at 1.9. This is a drastic decline.” TFR is the total fertility rate. According to Chandran, all estimates show India's maximum population will remain below 2 billion and expected to peak around 1.8-1.9 billion by 2080 when growth stabilises. According to the official, the fall in fertility rate is “primarily” due to increased development and education levels. “Increased female literacy has directly shaped decisions around marriage and childbearing, leading to smaller families. Greater use of contraceptives and wider access to birth control have further accelerated the decline,” he said. “Couples today are better informed and exercise greater control over when and how many children to have,” Chandran added. He further added that many are opting to marry later in life and choosing to grow economic opportunities, especially women are increasingly pursuing careers , which also has significantly influence on reproductive choices. Chandran noted that increased development has a direct impact on fertility. “Development is inversely proportional to birth rates . Illiterate groups still have fertility levels above three, but among the educated, TFR ranges between 1.5 and 1.8,” he said.

The veteran politician has publicly voiced deep alarm over reports of enforced disappearances of Baloch women and the alleged use of drone strikes by Pakistani forces in the region. McDonnell has used established parliamentary procedure to secure an official government response, tabling an Early Day Motion (EDM) and submitting three written questions that compelled ministers to reply within three days. The EDM registers profound alarm at specific, recent atrocities, including a drone strike on 5th October 2025 in Zehri, Khuzdar district, which reportedly killed six civilians, four of them children. It also highlights the case of Mahjabeen Baloch, a disabled student missing since 29th May, and the abduction of teenager Nasreena Baloch on 22nd November. The motion explicitly condemns the detention of five Baloch women on 17 November, labelling the action a form of collective punishment. The parliamentary pressure is aimed at forcing the UK Government to strengthen its diplomatic action, reminding ministers of their previous commitment to address human rights violations in Balochistan directly with Islamabad. In his questions, McDonnell specifically demands accountability from two government departments.

I don't know how it is being circulated,” he said. In an order that circulated late on Saturday, the Secondary Education Directorate in Bikaner instructed government and private schools to hold cultural programmes aimed at “enhancing patriotism ” among students. The directive proposed essay competitions on themes such as Indian cultural pride and the Ram Mandir movement, traditions of valour and sacrifice, and the role of the youth in nation-building. Schools were asked to organise painting contests on the Ayodhya Ram Mandir and Indian warriors, and display exhibitions on the Ram temple.

Starting from 01t January 2026, Non-AC Sleeper Class travelers can request sanitized, ready-to-usc bedrolls on an On-Demand - On-Payment basis.” This service will be initially implemented for a period of three years on ten trains maintained by Chennai Division.

But a US-based cardiologist is warning that these everyday discomforts could be the body signaling a silent heart attack risk — and timely attention can save lives. In a recent Instagram post, Arizona-based cardiologist Dr Jack Wolfson — with more than 16 years of clinical experience — highlighted five little-known symptoms that should not be ignored. “Everyone knows the classic signs of a heart attack,” he wrote, “but here are five you’ve probably never heard of — and they could save your life.” Dry, flaky or itchy skin, unexplained rashes and conditions like eczema can indicate inflammation in the body. According to Dr Wolfson, that internal “burning” — caused by inflammation and oxidative stress — is closely linked to a higher risk of heart disease and heart attacks. “Headaches are not normal,” he emphasised. They may point to issues with blood vessels or low nitric oxide levels — both red flags for cardiovascular strain. Persistent headaches should be checked, he says. Constipation, nausea, stomach bloating or ongoing abdominal pain could be tied to heart health. “The heart and the gut are intimately connected,” Dr Wolfson noted, urging people not to dismiss digestive woes as routine problems. Generalised aches — including tooth pain, shoulder pain or discomfort between the shoulder blades — can sometimes accompany a heart attack, especially in cases where chest pain isn’t prominent. “Any kind of pain anywhere could suggest inflammation,” he warned, linking it to elevated risks of heart attack and stroke. Broken sleep, night-time wakeups or chronic insomnia may also point to cardiovascular stress. “If you have sleep issues… these things are linked to increased heart attack risk,” he cautioned. “Your body whispers before it screams out in pain.” Early recognition and timely medical care remain ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/silent-heart-attack-warning-cardiologist-lists-5-overlooked-symptoms-you-should-never-ignore-11764491773304.html", "timestamp": 1764521501.1103325}

Trump has declared Venezuelan airspace should be closed, raising speculation of potential military action.", "content": "US President Donald Trump intensified his threats toward Venezuela on Saturday, issuing a stark warning that the country’s airspace should be regarded as “closed\". Following months of deadly US attacks on suspected drug-smuggling vessels, speculation is growing that Washington could carry out a military operation in Venezuela, according to AFP . Trump's warning follows days after US aviation authorities advised airlines to exercise increased caution near Venezuela due to rising tensions, prompting several major carriers to suspend flights. He stated this week that efforts to stop Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would start “very soon”, the report noted. “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers. Please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,” Trump said in a Truth social post from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. In recent months, the US has stepped up pressure on Caracas as part of a counter-narcotics effort targeting drug trafficking, which the Trump administration claims is orchestrated by Maduro’s regime. The administration has labelled Venezuela’s Cartel de los Soles as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, citing this designation as legal justification for certain operations, while Venezuela contends it is a false pretext for intervention. Trump also claims that the cartel is headed by the Venezuelan president. A report by Bloomberg said that as part of Trump's Venezuela strategy, the US has increased its military presence in the region, deploying an aircraft carrier and warships and sending senior military officials to meet with leaders across the Caribbean. Caracas, seeing the substantial US military presence in the Caribbean as an effort to force out President Nicolas Maduro, condemned Trump's warning as a “colonialist threat”. Maduro's government subsequently banned Turkish Airlines (TK) and five others, namely Iberia (IB), TAP Air Portugal (TP), Avianca (AV), LATAM (LA), and GOL (G3) for “jo", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/us-military-action-on-venezuela-looms-as-trump-orders-closure-of-airspace-around-south-american-countryexplained-11764472152974.html", "timestamp": 1764521501.8919415}

Sharing a detailed suggestion on X, Bedi divided her proposal into two key parts. The first, she said, must fix past accountability: What is the crisis due to? Who and what failed us? What has Delhi inherited over the years that led to this decline? The second should chart the road ahead — listing immediate, short-term and long-term measures, assigned clearly to responsible departments as well as citizens. Everyone, she emphasised, is both “a contributor and a solution”. Alongside strict enforcement, Bedi pushed for large-scale awareness campaigns through media and educational platforms to ensure collective responsibility. Bedi argued that Delhi needs less paperwork and more field-level action. She urged officers and civic authorities to step outdoors daily, inspect problem spots such as dusty roads and construction zones, and act on violations in real time rather than waiting for reports. Only then, she said, can coordination truly improve across agencies. Bedi also reached out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recalling how his virtual reviews during her tenure in Puducherry boosted efficiency across departments. She said recurring meetings between the PM, Delhi and neighbouring states — even monthly — could prevent seasonal spikes and fragmented responses. She outlined that environmental ministries and the Commission for Air Quality Management must ensure consistent compliance across the NCR, while state governments, municipal bodies and district magistrates must enforce daily checks on industrial emissions, construction rules, road dust and traffic congestion.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

From ‘AI-generated’ becoming part of our modern lexicon to ChatGPT, Face ID and Turnitin being just some examples of AI-powered technologies used practically everyday, AI is well and truly here – but what exactly is AI and how can you use it to work smarter? Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764521529.399529}
