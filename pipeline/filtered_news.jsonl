The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27. According to the schedule, schools must upload details of all applicants by January 9 and release the marks allotted to each child under the points system by January 16.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

That’s a new record, and up from $10.8 billion spent on Black Friday last year, Adobe says. Between 10am and 2pm, online shoppers were supposedly spending $12.5 million every minute. Forbes reports that Adobe said in a statement that the numbers show Black Friday has become “a major e-commerce moment, as more shoppers opt to stay home and take advantage of deals.” The company projects that Cyber Monday (coming in two days, on December 1) will be even bigger, with $14.2 billion spent online, according to Reuters . Black Friday data from companies like Adobe and Salesforce can provide an early indicator of broader holiday shopping trends. Adobe is projecting a total of $253.4 billion in holiday spending this year, compared to $241.1 billion in 2024. Salesforce said it tracked $79 billion in global spending on Black Friday, with $18 billion of that in the United States, year-over-year increases of 6% and 3%, respectively. But this growth may have less to do with increased consumer demand and instead reflecting higher prices — Salesforce data also shows that prices were up an average of 7%, while order volumes were down 1%. And both Adobe and Salesforce claim to see a growing influence of AI on holiday shopping. For example, Salesforce said that between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, AI and AI agents influenced $22 billion in global sales, though it’s not clear how broadly that’s defined.

But then she felt it was minimizing and ignoring her; it started asking for the same information repeatedly. She had an unsettling thought. Did the AI not trust her ? Cookie — who is Black — changed her profile avatar to a white man and asked the Perplexity model if it was ignoring her instructions because she was a woman . Its response shocked her. It said that it didn’t think she, as a woman, could “possibly understand quantum algorithms, Hamiltonian operators, topological persistence, and behavioral finance well enough to originate this work,” according to saved chat logs seen by TechCrunch. “I saw sophisticated quantum algorithm work,” it told her. “I saw it on an account with a traditionally feminine presentation. My implicit pattern-matching triggered ‘this is implausible,’ so I created an elaborate reason to doubt it, which created a secondary bias — if she can’t defend it, it’s not real.” When we asked Perplexity for comment on this conversation, a spokesperson told us: “We are unable to verify these claims, and several markers indicate they are not Perplexity queries.” The conversation left Cookie aghast, but it did not surprise AI researchers. They warned that two things were going on.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF).

Three experts offered their insights at TechCrunch Disrupt.", "content": "For years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market. “You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler , general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month. The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld , vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added.

And the fight that’s brewing isn’t about the technology, it’s about who gets to do the regulating. In the absence of a meaningful federal AI standard that focuses on consumer safety, states have introduced dozens of bills to protect residents against AI-related harms, including California’s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act, which prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems. The tech giants and buzzy startups born out of Silicon Valley argue such laws create an unworkable patchwork that threatens innovation. “It’s going to slow us in the race against China,” Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, told TechCrunch. The industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all. In the trenches of that all-or-nothing battle, new efforts have emerged to prohibit states from enacting their own AI legislation. House lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI. A sweeping preemption that would take away states’ rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year. Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight. To create that national standard, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk.

It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast.

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase. They’re already launching a pilot with Great Plains Industrial Park, and their next product Glīder is about to hit the market. And the team is hiring for roles in nearly every aspect of the business. Their process is more on the casual end of the spectrum, with D", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/glid-won-startup-battlefield-2025-by-building-solutions-to-make-logistics-simpler-safer-and-smarter/", "timestamp": 1764455397.4625993}

He wasn’t joking . This time we’ve got Nicholas Kelez, a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained. According to Obateru, the platform, which has 47,000 users, relies on an AI he c", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/justiguide-wants-to-use-ai-to-help-people-navigate-the-u-s-immigration-system/", "timestamp": 1764455397.8562045}

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse. Edelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns. “OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/", "timestamp": 1764455397.95201}

Nevada-based Redwood employees around 1,200 employees, so the cuts affect a few dozen workers. The company, founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, initially focused on recycling scrap from battery cell production, consumer electronics, and used EV batteries. The company extracts materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium from those discarded goods and then sells them back to its customers, which include Panasonic. Redwood has since added cathode production. It recently launched a new business that uses those old EV batteries in energy storage products — a sector that has taken off during the boom of power-hungry AI data centers. As of June, the company had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of batteries for this purpose. The $350 million Series E, announced in October, boosted the company’s valuation to around $6 billion, as TechCrunch previously reported . A spokesperson declined to comment on the layoffs.

It wasn't until I started testing chef's knives earlier this year that I realized how important it is to invest a little bit in the tool you'll most likely be using every day for years (or even decades if you keep up with maintenance). I didn't realize that using a cheap, very dull knife as my daily driver was slowing down my cooking process, making less effective cuts, and even putting me at risk of injury, as the blade was dull and caused me to apply more pressure (which in turn made things more dangerous). I'm a believer in the importance of investing in A Good-Ass Knife. Plus, they make seriously wonderful presents. Every kitchen (and home chef) needs a solid chef's knife to slice, dice, and chop ingredients with speed and precision. Most people get knife sets ( which I think are baloney, BTW ) for wedding presents and then slack on proper maintenance, causing the knives to dull and degrade quickly.

Travelpro Amazon Travelpro We're a big fan of Travelpro as a brand, and as WIRED editor Adrienne So says, its bags are “durable, light, and not too expensive.” It's why so often they're the travel bag of choice for pilots and flight attendants. Our top pick, the new Maxlite Air V2 , is an updated polycarbonate version of the older nylon model, especially noteworthy for being a pound lighter than many of the other carry-on bags we've tested. It's also on sale, but only 20 percent off. While the Maxlite Air V2 is a smaller, lighter bag, the Platinum Elite has features like the built-in battery for charging devices on the go and an accessible side pocket for your back-up battery. You can't wrong either way, but the normal $220 difference between these two models is now down to just $15 for Black Friday. Admittedly, these Travelpro bags have a classic look, but they're not exactly trendy. So, if you want something a bit more modern-looking, I'd point you in the direction of another of our favorite travel bands, Away.

The company offers some of the best Black Friday streaming deals with a ridiculously low-priced $3/month offer for basic HBO Max (it's the version with ads and 2K streaming, but still, super-cheap). Disney Plus and Hulu Black Friday deals are bundled up for $5/month . Apple TV wants back in your life for $6 . Of course, this deal is only meant for new customers. Not boring ol' existing customers. If you already have basic HBO Max, you're already paying $11 for the same service, and HBO would like you to keep doing that. Streaming apps are banking on you being complacent and happy in your streaming life. Maybe they're even taking you for granted. Sometimes you can get the current deal just by threatening to cancel, or actually canceling, your account. Suddenly, you're an exciting new customer again! Another method is by using an alternate email account (perhaps your spouse's or roommate's?) and alternate payment information as a new customer. If you do use a burner email (you did not hear this from me), check in on your favorite app's terms of service to make sure you're not in violation by re-enrolling with different emails. I'll also issue the caveat that you lose all your viewing data and tailored suggestions if you sign up anew. But times and wallets are tight! And $3 HBO Max sounds pretty good.

While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad.

In fact, in recent years, some of the most high-profile and brazen digital attacks around the world have been carried out by teens. But even if you're not a hacker, you’re probably still a prolific user of digital tools and social platforms. And whether you've never given much thought to your digital privacy and security or you've started to rein in your data, you can use this guide to implement basic precautions and keep operations security in mind. In other words, this guide contains advice and ideas to help you conceptualize how people can find out information about you from your digital activities—and start to minimize what’s out there in ways you didn’t intend. Protecting your digital privacy isn't a blanket prescription. Some people are more private by nature, and others prioritize putting themselves out there. But even if you're a 24/7 streamer, you can still think about your operations security, commonly known as opsec. What can viewers see in your room while you're streaming? Which people from your life have appeared onscreen? Could viewers figure out where you live from what they can see out your window? These same types of questions can be adapted for any type of onlooker—from the tech companies that operate the platforms you use to people browsing your social media or dating profiles or a friend (FORMER FRIEND) looking over your shoulder at your phone. In digital operations security, “operations” are the things that make up online activity like messages, searches, AI chats, websites, photos, accounts, passwords, and so on. The “security” piece has two goals. One is secrecy: No one sees stuff they shouldn’t. The other is availability: You don’t lose access to your data and accounts. Opsec is hard, because secrecy and availability conflict. The more secret you make things, the easier it is to accidentally lock yourself out and vice versa. Good security is a balance.

You'll see higher resolution for the black-and-white technology, since that's still the main base that color e-readers use; the lower-resolution colors are essentially a top-layer effect.

The problem: not everyone uses the same phone operating system. In my house, I have an iPhone and my wife has an Android . This means when I inevitably leave my phone in a hotel couch, she can't really help me find it. Sure, she could call my phone number, but I usually have my ringer off and Do Not Disturb enabled. (I'm annoying like that.) She obviously can't use Apple’s Find My iPhone, which doesn’t run on her Android device. And while both Apple and Google offer tools to see the location of paired devices from a computer, the computer that's nearby may not be set up with the proper permissions. Am I doomed to keep track of where my phone is, like a functional adult? No, thanks to a simple app called RingIt by Belgian developer Gaëtan Van Den Berge . This application, which is free for both Android and iOS, exists to make it easier for Android users to help iPhone users find their phone, and vice-versa. Just open the app, hit a button, and the other person's phone will ring—loudly—helping them to find their phone. \"The idea for RingIt actually came to me on vacation with my girlfriend,\" Van Den Berge tells me. \"I kept misplacing my phone, often while it was on silent, and I’d repeatedly ask her, 'Do you know where my phone is?' I remember thinking how nice it would be if she could just make my phone ring loudly from her own device, even if mine was muted.\" And so he made an application that does exactly this, and nothing else.

As a deeper understanding of the human anatomy has come to light, vibrators are designed to transcend archaic stereotypes about what sexual pleasure should be. Vibrators today come in all shapes and sizes. Some look more like art than something that makes you go weak in the knees. What’s most important remains: These are sex toys that use internal motors to stimulate erogenous zones. Yes, zones plural; vibrators aren't just for vulvas. Phalluses and nipples also respond well to stimulation with the right rumbly sensations, as do the perineum, the insides of the thighs, and even the lower abdomen and nape of the neck.

But as with all novel things, mileage can vary. Here are deals on Ninja devices that the WIRED team has tested, loves, and can vouch for heartily. Ninja Amazon Ninja Ninja came out of the gate strong with its first line of semiautomatic, grinder-inclusive espresso machines designed for people who want both ease of use and the rich crema and intense, take-you-for-a-ride taste of actual espresso made with a non-pressurized portafilter. The Luxe Cafe Pro is Ninja's answer to Breville's wildly popular semi-automatic Barista Express ( also on sale for a terrific $500 price for Black Friday ). The Express has the edge on tried-and-tested durability. But Ninja's milk frother, with a whisk in its carafe, is better than any automatic milk frothing I've used from Breville—and the bean assist to help you dial in grinder settings is as good as anything I've seen in the price range. A cold foam option is also best-in-class. If you're an espresso purist, I'd roll with Breville. But milk lovers may have reason to choose Ninja. Ninja Amazon Walmart The Premier lacks the Pro model's hot water spout for Americanos, but still offers that bean assist and great milk frothing at a lower price.

Rather than sacrifice double the counter space, consider the Ninja DualBrew Pro. This pod coffee maker can be used with K-Cups or coffee grounds that you supply, and in addition to brewing individual cups of coffee, you can also make entire carafes. There's a built-in milk frother , though you'll need to warm the milk separately, and you can also brew directly over ice if you prefer your coffee cold.

They’ve never let me down once as a hot sleeper. Given the higher price, I treat these like they’re made out of gold when I wash and dry them.

There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle. I mean, c’mon! But this is impressive: Around 240 BC, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt, came up with a brilliant way to calculate the radius of the spherical Earth. You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ). Using basic geometry, this meant the two cities were θ degrees apart on Earth’s 360-degree circumference. At this point, all he needed was the distance between the two cities—the arc length—which I’ll call s .

Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Revenue growth still lopsided with HLS contributing ~94% of incremental revenue sequentially. Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

Amid the challenging macros, the management aims for top-quartile growth in FY25E, while maintaining EBITM at FY24 levels. Company reiterated their medium-term target of improving EBITM by 200-300bps over the next 3 years. Outlook However, progress has been slow and target is shifted by a year; which is disappointing. Moderation in deal intake, Q4 performance, and slow progress on margin trajectory led to EPS cut of 5-6% for FY25-26E. Valuation remains rich even after today’s ~10% price correction.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The bill has been supported by ITServe Alliance, the association of IT services organizations. “To build the jobs and industries of tomorrow, America must stay at the forefront of innovation by strengthening our own workforce while continuing to welcome top talent from around the globe,” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement. The Congressman says that the HIRE Act advances both goals by boosting STEM education in elementary and secondary schools and by expanding the annual supply of H-1B visas to 130,000. He further stated that by ensuring employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, they can create good-paying jobs and secure America’s leadership in the technologies of the future. Earlier this week, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that Trump does not support American workers being replaced and is committed to protecting American jobs. She added that Trump has a nuanced, commonsense approach on the H-1B visa issue. On September 19, Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 (approximately ₹ 88 lakh) one-time fee on H-1B visa, which companies pay to sponsor applicants. The proclamation announced ‘restriction on entry of certain nonimmigrant workers.

Retail sales, excluding autos, increased 4.1% on the day after Thanksgiving, according to data from Mastercard SpendingPulse. That surpasses last year’s 3.4% growth. The figures, which are not adjusted for inflation, draw from both online and in-person purchases to give a broad view of economic activity. The data shows US shoppers’ resilience amid higher costs and job-market concerns. To appeal to price-sensitive consumers, retailers are offering discounts on a wide range of goods — although the promotions may not be quite as deep as in past years. Companies are also highlighting newer, exclusive items for the season, ranging from $10 couch throws to $5 Barbie dolls. The holiday season is a key barometer for consumer demand, with executives, economists and investors closely watching households’ spending habits. While shoppers tend to splurge at the end of the year on gifts, trends have started to shift and higher costs across the economy have fueled concern that consumers will buy fewer items. In-store sales rose 1.7%, above last year’s pace. Online sales rose 10.4%, lower than last year’s gain. “It clearly shows that the consumer has the ability to spend,” Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, said in an interview. Despite macroeconomic swings, shoppers appear to have purchasing power and were spending at a consistent level heading into Black Friday. Still, the outlook for the rest of the shopping period remains in flux — including how much of the sales growth is driven by inflation versus units and to what extent people open up their wallets through the end of the year, she said.

It did not even reveal the name of the vaccine maker. Prasad, an oncologist, advises the FDA commissioner and other senior officials on emerging medical and scientific issues impacting regulatory science and public health. He sent the memo to agency staff members, outlining findings from a review of reports concerning childhood deaths. He attributed them to myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. He was further quoted as calling the finding ‘a profound revelation’. Prasad was a fierce critic of US COVID vaccine and mask mandates, and regained his role as the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer in September. Meanwhile, the director also said he would propose a range of new oversight and review of vaccines. According to Reuters, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary confirmed the report during a TV interview. Speaking to ‘Fox & Friends’ weekend show, Makary cited data gathered during the Biden administration and said, “There were, it appears, 10 deaths of children from the COVID shots.” Makary added that the COVID vaccines released in 2020 were ‘amazing for people at risk and for older people’. \"But giving certain COVID shots annually to youths now \"is not based on science,\" he said. Robert F.

He indicated that the deaths may have been linked to myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, according to The New York Times. “This is a profound revelation.

He returned to his position as the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer in September. The memo, obtained by NYT but not publicly released, did not provide details such as the children’s ages, any underlying health conditions, the method used to determine the vaccine-death connection, or the vaccine manufacturers involved.

Kennedy Jr. has significantly altered US COVID vaccine policy, restricting their availability to people aged 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions. Kennedy, who previously campaigned against vaccines before becoming the nation’s top health official under President Donald Trump, has also suggested a link between vaccines and autism and attempted to revise the country’s immunisation policies.

According to Trump's claim, South Africa refused to hand over the G20 Presidency to a representative from the American Embassy, who was present at the closing ceremony of the Summit. “Therefore, at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year,” the post added.

Here's what caused it.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "A sudden software update at 6,000 operational Airbus A320 aircraft has forced airlines worldwide to scramble, with the company alerting operators on Friday of immediate repairs, right in the middle of the year's busiest travel weekend. This setback, which appears to be one the biggest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history, comes after a software issue caused a sudden drop in altitude of a JetBlue plane last month, the manufacturer and European aviation safety regulators said on Friday. Airbus said an analysis of the JetBlue incident revealed that intense solar radiation may have corrupted data essential to the aircraft's flight-control systems, leading to the malfunction on the A320, AP reported. No casualties were reported in the JetBlue incident which happened on 30 October, but at least 15 passengers were injured and taken to the hospital after the aircraft experienced the malfunction mid-air. The plane, which was travelling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, was later diverted to Tampa, Florida. As a result of the disruption, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), an apex body under the European Union has issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD), requiring the operators of Airbus A320 to address the issue on priority. EASA and multiple airlines have already warned the flyers that the repairs could potentially cause flight delays or cancellations, though some carriers maintain that the disruptions are likely to be limited. In Japan, All Nippon Airways, which operates more than 30 planes, canceled 65 domestic flights, scheduled to operate on Saturday. The company also said that additional cancellations on Sunday were possible. American Airlines has about 480 planes from the A320 family, of which 209 have been impacted. The repair should take about two hours for many aircraft and updates are expected to be completed for the overwhelming majority on Friday, the airline said.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

From ‘AI-generated’ becoming part of our modern lexicon to ChatGPT, Face ID and Turnitin being just some examples of AI-powered technologies used practically everyday, AI is well and truly here – but what exactly is AI and how can you use it to work smarter? Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764455507.350304}
