On India’s relations with Pakistan, the book notes: “Before the 1947 Partition – a legacy of the colonial era that continues to shape the present – Pakistan was a part of India. Let us note for now that Pakistan was founded on religious basis, unlike India; this will be explored further in Grade 8. Suffice to say that these nations share one of the most complex relationships in South Asia.” “Since the Partition, several military conflicts and wars, including wars in 1948, 1965 and 1971, and full-scale conflicts like the Kargil War in 1999, have defined an ongoing tension.

Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system.

According to Vaishnaw, vacancies in the Railways arise on a continuous basis due to the organisation’s vast workforce, ongoing technological upgrades and operational expansion.

Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year.

With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test.

The admission cycle will begin on December 4, and schools have also been directed to strictly adhere to the notified timeline, without any deviation. The announcement comes in continuation of the age-restructuring process that began with the introduction of the Foundational Stage under the National Education Policy (NEP).

According to the DoE, the following minimum and maximum ages (as on 31 March 2026) will apply across all private unaided recognised schools: –Nursery (Balvatika 1/Pre-School 1): 3+ years up to 4 years –KG (Balvatika 2/Pre-Primary/Pre-School 2): 4+ years up to 5 years –Class 1: 5+ years up to 6 years The DoE has clarified that children admitted to Nursery in 2025–26 will automatically move to KG in 2026–27, and those in KG in 2025–26 will move to Class 1. Admissions to Nursery for 2026–27 will therefore apply strictly to children who have completed three years but not completed four years by March 31, 2026. The circular reiterates that these rules are being enforced exactly as detailed in the DoE’s order dated October 24, 2025, which had first operationalised the NEP-aligned foundational stage structuring.

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers. But the rise of IIT Bombay was also inseparable from the city that housed it, a city whose own history of names reflects centuries of shifting rule, culture, and political imagination.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

This year’s major highlights include the Valedictory Function at Rameswaram, marking the grand culmination of the event, and the launch of a new initiative — Tamil Karpom — enabling students from North India to learn Tamil in Tamil Nadu. “Kashi Tamil Sangamam 4.0 will be organised around the theme ‘Learn Tamil – Tamil Karkalam’, with the aim to promote Tamil learning across India and foster wider appreciation for India’s classical linguistic and literary heritage. “In this edition of Kashi Tamil Sangamam, more than 1,400 delegates from Tamil Nadu will participate under seven categories,” a senior Education Ministry official said. Delegates will undertake an eight-day experiential tour, including visits to Varanasi, Prayagraj and Ayodhya, along with interactions, seminars, cultural performances and exposure to local cuisine, handicrafts and heritage, the official added. As in previous editions, the IIT-Madras and the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) will serve as the nodal institutions for implementing Kashi Tamil Sangamam 4.0, in collaboration with the Uttar Pradesh government and several Central ministries. The first month-long Kashi Tamil Sangamam was held in 2022 to revive the bonds between Varanasi and Tamil Nadu.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021. Underlining the relevance of a single higher education regulator, the NEP-2020 document says, “The regulatory system needs a complete overhaul to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.” It adds that the new system should ensure the distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting are ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/winter-session-parliament-to-take-up-bill-replacing-ugc-aicte-ncte-with-single-regulator-10381204/", "timestamp": 1765279584.4509053}

The FTC denied a request to cancel that ban made by Scott Zuckerman, the founder of consumer spyware company Support King and its subsidiaries SpyFone and OneClickMonitor. On Monday, the FTC announced the denial in a press release after Zuckerman petitioned the federal watchdog to rescind or modify the ban order in July of this year. In 2021, the FTC banned Zuckerman from “offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,” effectively preventing him from running another stalkerware business. The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. “SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.” In his petition , Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition. When reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.

The Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor , to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales , CNBC reported. H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported. An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump’s hands . The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security. Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years. The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips. While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.

The tech giant says the idea behind the new feed is to display recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with. The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms. It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident. TechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit.

The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness. During that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.” PIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported . In 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups , according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations. When interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way . After the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund , and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role , while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role.

More than 230 organizations, including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. “The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. Several studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills. Electricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade. The effects are expected to be felt most in a handful of states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are slated for the largest increase in data center capacity.

The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests. The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work. Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots. For Slack, positioning itself as an “ agentic hub ” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work. By letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows. While Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic.

However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months. The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content. What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page. “This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model.

Agentic commerce — the use of AI tools to do shopping research and make purchases on a user’s behalf — is a current priority for OpenAI. Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT .

Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season. Despite ChatGPT’s immense popularity, OpenAI is not making a profit, and it may not for another several years — if it ever does. Its products are so resource-intensive that even subscription costs don’t account for how much compute power the company uses to make its product work. These agentic commerce tools could give OpenAI another way of making money, since it’ll take an undisclosed “ small fee ” when it helps merchants make a sale.

On Friday, in a legally required filing with Texas’ attorney general’s office, Petco reported that the affected data included names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, financial information such as account numbers, credit or debit card numbers, and dates of birth. Petco filed similar legally required notices in California, Massachusetts , and Montana . In the latter two states, Petco reported one and three affected residents, respectively. The company did not disclose the exact number of victims in California, where companies are required to disclose breaches involving at least 500 state residents, which suggests there are more victims than that number in the state. Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera did not respond to a series of questions sent on Monday, which included how many customers in total were affected by this incident; whether Petco has any technical means, including logs, to determine whether any cybercriminals had access and stole the customers’ exposed data; what and when was the specific issue identified; and what was the application involved in the incident. For context, in 2022, Petco said it served more than 24 million customers. On Friday, Petco spokesperson Ventura Olvera said in a statement to TechCrunch that the company had “provided further information to individuals whose information was involved.” California’s attorney general published a sample letter that Petco is sending to its customers. The message said Petco discovered an issue with “a setting within one of our software applications that inadvertently allowed certain files to be accessible online,” that the company “immediately took steps to correct the issue and to remove the files from further online access,” and that it “corrected” the setting and implemented unspecified “additional s", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/petcos-security-lapse-affected-customers-ssns-drivers-licenses-and-more/", "timestamp": 1765279857.7739992}

The company previously raised a $33 million Series A, which it announced in April 2024. The new round was led by Energy Impact Partners and Galvanize with participation from Alumni Ventures, Gradient Ventures, Incite Ventures, and Lowercarbon Capital. Veery Maxwell at Galvanize will be joining the board, as will former Nest CFO Tom vonReichbauer. (The latter should come as no surprise given that many Quilters used to work at Nest.) The new funding will go toward expanding the company’s footprint. Quilt has installed nearly 1,000 units in 16 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, co-founder and CEO Paul Lambert said in a note posted on the company’s website. Quilt has been a rare startup challenging entrenched incumbents in the heat pump market. To unseat them, the company has taken a software- and design-first approach. One example is an over-the-air update the company pushed to heat pumps that were already installed; the new software and firmware improved the performance of existing units by more than 20% .

Discovery (WBD), days after Warner agreed to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7 billion. Paramount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share. Paramount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. CNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago. “We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement . Paramount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo. Netflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months. Netflix’s proposed deal has already raised antitrust questions, as it would combine two of the most popular streaming platforms into one. Additionally, President Donald Trump has said the deal “could be a problem” because of the size of the combined companies’ market share. A deal between WBD and Paramount would also likely raise similar concerns. Netflix agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if the deal doesn’t go through. WBD would have to pay Netflix $2.8 billion if it decides to call off the deal.

The tech giant said it would offer $31 for each Confluent share, which is about 50% more than what the smaller company’s shares closed at on Friday, before news of the deal. Confluent offers a platform that helps enterprises manage streams of data in real time, a use case that’s exploded in demand as ever more companies develop and deploy AI products, which require significant back-and-forth processing of data for inferencing. IBM said Confluent will complement its existing data and automation products, as well as improve upon its existing offerings across AI, automation, data, and consulting. The company expects the deal to add to EBITDA and free cash flow in the two years after the deal is closed. This is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant’s largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024. IBM in October signed a deal with AI lab Anthropic to deploy the Claude large language model into some of its products; it has partnered with AMD to develop a new computing architecture that combines quantum systems with AI-specialized chips; and it acquired data analysis startup Seek AI in June.

The company says the space is designed to give creators everything they need to produce viral videos, grow their audience, and tap into trends, whether it’s creating day-in-the-life vlogs, travel videos, or behind-the-scenes clips. By partnering with Adobe, YouTube is giving creators on its platform an exclusive space to create content, encouraging them to use its partners’ space instead of competitors’ tools, like Meta’s Edits or CapCut, which is owned by TikTok parent ByteDance. “Although content edited in Premiere mobile can be shared to other social platforms, what’s unique about this partnership is that creators getting inspiration from their YouTube Shorts feed, can launch a template that caught their eye, directly into Premiere mobile and start customizing it for their own channel,” said Meagan Keane, director, Product Marketing, Digital Video and Audio at Adobe, in an email to TechCrunch. “This content creation space within the Premiere mobile app is designed and optimized for YouTube Shorts.” The Create for YouTube Shorts content creation space in Premiere mobile features Shorts templates from top creators with built-in text, effects, and transition presets. Creators can add their own media and customize the templates to their style. They also have the option to create and submit their own original templates.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?” To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games. Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives. However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do.

The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google. The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index , the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers. The AI giant has committed $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. “If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.” OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value.

Others see the self-driving car boom as perpetuating auto dependency.", "content": "Los Angeles is a car city, and it’s rarely more obvious than from a vulnerable perch on top of a bicycle . Among big cities in the US, LA has a middling-to-bad reputation for bike riding. A lack of connected cycling lanes and safe crossings led one national cycling advocacy organization to recently rank LA’s bike network 1,136th in the nation. The city’s auto leanings are inscribed on its infrastructure—with deadly consequences. According to one local outlet , at least 12 Angelenos have died while riding this year. So it’s surprising that Eli Akira Kaufman, the executive director of the LA county cycling advocacy group BikeLA, is pretty excited about a car. Specifically, a car driven by a robot. For more than a year now, the Alphabet subsidiary Waymo has been picking up riders in the western half of the city. Kaufman likes what he sees. “They don’t drive stressed, tired, inebriated, racist,” he says. He finds Waymos pilot predictably, mostly adhering to traffic laws. When he’s riding, “I deprioritize them in terms of my level of concern. I can focus on the human drivers.” Kaufman’s feelings represent a shift for the cycling community, and something like a schism. For years, some bike riders have viewed the efforts of autonomous vehicle tech developers—and the automakers supporting them—with deep suspicion. Self-driving cars are, after all, cars, which are heavy and dangerous; more than 40,000 Americans die in traffic incidents each year. Moreover, if autonomous vehicles neatly replace the cars and trucks of today, advocates worry that other forms of transportation lose out. The long-term result of doubling down on auto travel might be sprawling cities with few opportunities for low-cost, emissions-free ways to get around. Exactly, one might argue, the sort of cities that exist today. But as more self-driving vehicle services pop up around the country, they have racked up a safety record that, while far from definitive, seems to improve on the performance of humans.

With several teams across CMS hosting holiday gatherings this month, I am sharing some strategies to help you make healthier choices—while still indulging in festive treats,” Oz wrote in his latest missive, which appears as a recurring section in his weekly bulletin titled “From the Administrator’s Desk,” according to emails viewed by WIRED. “Set your intentions,” writes Oz. “Decide in advance how many treats you’ll allow yourself to enjoy and try to stick to that number. You don’t have to try every cookie on the cookie table.” His email continues with further guidance: “practice portion control,” “be mindful,” and “don’t double fist,” he tells the agency’s more than 6,000 employees. He advises subordinates to “eat off a small plate when you can and take small portions of treats so you can enjoy them without overeating,” to eat more slowly (“Savor each bite, put your fork down between bites, and pay attention to your body’s cues,” he counsels), and not to hold food and beverages in more than one hand so as to free up “the other for shaking hands with colleagues and friends during this festive period.” This kind of advice has appeared in Oz’s emails since early November. In the past, Oz has promoted a number of unproven medical tips surrounding weight loss. He at one time pushed weight-loss solutions that he subsequently admitted in a 2014 Senate subcommittee hearing “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact.” (Oz had promoted one such product on his show as “magic,” claiming, “You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they’ve found the magic weight-loss cure for every body type—it’s green co", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/dr-oz-centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services-tells-employees-to-eat-less/", "timestamp": 1765279860.2722027}

This is one of the core features in Sora, OpenAI’s app for sharing AI videos inside a TikTok-style feed. The self-deepfaking feature was called “cameo,” and with that standout feature, Sora quickly rose to the top of Apple’s iOS download charts. This feature name led to a trademark lawsuit with Cameo , the app where fans can pay celebrities to record personalized videos. Now, because of the legal action, OpenAI has temporarily scrubbed the “cameo” branding from its Sora app . The app now refers to the feature as “characters.” Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI , which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. In addition to being told to remove “cameo” from Sora, OpenAI was also recently ordered not to call its upcoming hardware device “io,” in response to a separate lawsuit from a company named “iyO” that’s already building an AI-powered hardware device. According to update logs on OpenAI’s website, the company removed the name for the Sora feature over a week after US District Judge Eumi K. Lee issued a temporary restraining order. The judge’s order blocked OpenAI from using “cameo” or variations of the word. The next hearing, which may decide whether this ban sticks, is scheduled for December 19. Discussions between Cameo and OpenAI have been “pretty nonexistent,” according to Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo. “They clearly knew Cameo existed. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “They chose the name anyway.” He sees this lawsuit as an “existential” battle over the word “cameo” and the app’s brand he has built over the past eight years. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic persona", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/openai-cameo-products-that-already-exist/", "timestamp": 1765279860.3966734}

From tiny, $25 devices that will fit in a pocket, to massive, $400-plus boom boxes that require a built-in handle or shoulder strap, there’s a Bluetooth speaker for nearly every budget and gathering size. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for yet another model, as JBL proves with its new $100 JBL Grip. It’s essentially a smaller and lighter version of the company’s hugely popular Flip series, placing it between the Flip 7 and the JBL Go 4/Clip 5 on the portability scale. For some folks, that’s going to be the goldilocks zone. But just to sweeten the deal, JBL has reached into its toolbox and given the Grip an integrated LED light show, clearly inspired by the brand’s popular PartyBox lineup of party speakers. In keeping with JBL’s colorful approach to its smallest speakers, the Grip is available in red, white, black, purple, “squad” (a camo motif), and blue (pictured here). It’s 32 percent smaller than the JBL Flip 7— but it’s the Grip’s weight that will make throwing it in a backpack feel like an easy decision: At 0.8 pounds, the Grip is less than half the weight of the Flip 7 (1.8 pounds), making it light enough to hang from tree branches that would buckle under the Flip 7. JBL Grip Rating: 7/10 Despite the Grip’s smaller size, JBL pegs battery life on both speakers at the same 14-hour maximum. On the Grip at least, that might be overpromising. When I ran the speaker at 50 percent volume continuously, I only got about 10.5 hours. Using JBL’s PlayTime Boost mode could help if you really need to eke out a few more songs. The familial similarities continue with the Grip’s ability to withstand the elements. Like the Flip 7, it’s rated IP68, making it effectively dust- and waterproof. They’re both shockproof, and yet the Grip is arguably more durable, since both ends are solid silicone rubber.

Trail running isn’t immune to the endless subcategories, and the newest niche is gravel shoes—a subset of trail running shoes designed specifically for mixed-terrain runs across compacted gravel paths, forest roads, hard-pack trails, and regular old roads. But are the brands just repackaging trail running shoes with smaller lugs? Or do gravel shoes genuinely offer something new and different?

They’re designed to let you run off-road—just not too far off the beaten track and certainly not onto the trickiest mountain slopes.

Players walk clockwise in a circle. When the music stops, everyone sits in a chair. Big Tech is setting in motion its plans for the next gen of lead designers, engineers, AI chiefs, and even CEOs. In Cupertino, Apple execs with familiar faces are retiring or reducing responsibilities. Who’s in and who’s out? Well, chief operating officer Jeff Williams retired in November, and the speculation is that CEO Tim Cook could follow in the near term. Lisa Jackson, who has led Apple’s sustainability efforts since 2013, is now set to retire in January too. There’s also the squad of Apple staffers who have been lured away to work with OpenAI , notably Apple’s former chief design officer Jony Ive after his independent stint at LoveFrom . In 2024, Molly Anderson was named industrial design leader, heading up a team of mostly fresh faces. Others have gone to Meta, such as Apple’s VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, who just this week was poached to head up a new Reality Labs design studio. At Apple, he’s been replaced by longtime UI designer Stephen Lemay. Phew. In this swirl of shifting talent, John Ternus, who has worked for Apple since 2001, and served as SVP of hardware engineering for the last four years, reporting directly to Tim Cook, is emerging as the front-runner to succeed Cook as Apple CEO, reportedly as soon as next year. WIRED asked Apple for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. Alongside a steady drip of “leaks” on succession planning and Ternus’ position at the front of the pack, since 2023, Ternus has been given more prominence at product launch events. He announced the iPhone Air onstage this past September, and has appeared alongside other senior Apple leaders in press interviews and in-store Apple events. “I think they're testing to see what sentiment is like.

Here’s a test for infants: Show them a glass of water on a desk. Hide it behind a wooden board. Now move the board toward the glass. If the board keeps going past the glass, as if it weren’t there, are they surprised? Many 6-month-olds are, and by a year, almost all children have an intuitive notion of an object’s permanence, learned through observation. Now some artificial intelligence models do too. Researchers have developed an AI system that learns about the world via videos and demonstrates a notion of “surprise” when presented with information that goes against the knowledge it has gleaned. The model, created by Meta and called Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), does not make any assumptions about the physics of the world contained in the videos. Nonetheless, it can begin to make sense of how the world works. “Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting,” says Micha Heilbron , a cognitive scientist at the University of Amsterdam who studies how brains and artificial systems make sense of the world. As the engineers who build self-driving cars know, it can be hard to get an AI system to reliably make sense of what it sees. Most systems designed to “understand” videos in order to either classify their content (“a person playing tennis,” for example) or identify the contours of an object—say, a car up ahead—work in what’s called “pixel space.” The model essentially treats every pixel in a video as equal in importance. But these pixel-space models come with limitations. Imagine trying to make sense of a suburban street. If the scene has cars, traffic lights and trees, the model might focus too much on irrelevant details such as the motion of the leaves. It might miss the color of the traffic light, or the positions of nearby cars. “When you go to images or video, you don’t want to work in [pixel] space because there are too many details you d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-one-ai-model-creates-a-physical-intuition-of-its-environment/", "timestamp": 1765279861.8491669}

Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider ) had \"Norwegian kaiju\" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating \"Megatroll\" it has locked away. Soon, Nora—reunited with allies Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Major Kris Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen)—is caught in another desperate race to prevent a trollpocalypse. This time though, there's an edge of Indiana Jones at work, with a madcap ancient conspiracy to decode alongside the troll-smashing action. Troll 2 is a bit more tongue-in-cheek than its predecessor, and ventures into so-bad-it's-good territory in places, but it knows exactly what it is and what it's offering: giant rock monsters beating the boulders off of each other.

After what feels like a thousand years trapped in the Upside Down (although in reality only three and a half), Stranger Things is back for its fifth and final season. Following the reality-tearing events of Stranger Things 4 , the residents of Hawkins are now under military quarantine, but not everyone is taking it laying down. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) is secretly training her powers, aided by adoptive parents Hopper (David Harbour) and Joyce (Winona Ryder), while Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), and the rest of the adventuring party are organizing an underground movement to hunt down demonic big-bad Vecna. But when Mike's young sister Holly (Nell Fisher) is dragged into the Upside Down by a Demogorgon, it raises one major question—just why was Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) kidnapped at the very start of the show, instigating the wave of horror that's consumed Hawkins since?

You could take all of your games with you, install mods and custom software, or even plug into a hub and get some work done. Lenovo is taking another swing at the Windows handheld game with the Legion Go 2, undeterred by mixed reviews on the original Legion Go and streamlined Legion Go S . But even a snappier interface and versatile input methods can’t overcome a lot of the barriers inherent to running Windows on a device with no keyboard. If you’re willing to put in the work, or you already love your original Legion Go, the performance, screen, and software support have all improved. If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I’d recommend picking something a little lower maintenance. I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand. Lenovo Go Gen 2 Rating: 7/10 Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings. It’s unique, and the easy access to a mouse and right-click without using the touchpad is a nice bonus, but the way you grip the controller means you're always kind of palming the joystick on the side.

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain . By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity . The present crisis reflects not only this summer’s extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry. The drought quickly disrupted Tehran’s urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank . Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation , and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved . These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran’s infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress. These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer. Over the past five years, precipitation during this wet period has remained consistently below the long-term climatological baseline, with the 2024-25 season showing the most pronounce", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/why-tehran-is-running-out-of-water-iran-climate-change-drought-extreme-weather/", "timestamp": 1765279862.3688896}

Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept —a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell. British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing. Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new . Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn’t until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings. Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet Rating: 9/10 RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila! The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company’s name, RLS, or “Relea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/canyon-deflectr-rls-bike-helmet/", "timestamp": 1765279862.5683146}

The lowest tier contains cheap machines one would buy as a housewarming present for a friend or relative’s third or fourth property, like a timeshare in the country or a freshly christened yacht. The second-lowest is a mandatory gift for someone you don’t know well or care for very much, such as the wedding of a distant cousin or former nemesis. The third tier is a gift for someone you know and like, and the fourth is a treat yo’ self gift you bestow upon yourself after finishing a large project, landing a promotion at work, or finally turning a profit at your bespoke AI-powered marketing and SEO agency. Gevi’s imaginatively named Espresso Machine lands at the high end of the second tier. This single-boiler, 15-bar machine performs essential functions like grinding coffee, pulling shots, and steaming milk at a level that’s acceptable for its cost.

Valve had already banned an early, incomplete version of the game two years ago and offered, according to Santa Ragione , little clarification about why at the time. Then, hours before the game’s release, the Epic Games Store banned Horses as well. A day after the game’s launch, distribution platform Humble removed, and then later relisted, the title. The public swiftly spoke out against these bans, and community support for the game’s developers has been plentiful. Many pieces have been written online about how the game doesn’t deserve to be shunned by the distribution platforms, and about how the game’s content is relatively tame . But too few of these pieces engage with the content of the game on a critical level. Horses ’ storytelling is clumsy, and its blasé treatment of the sexual assaults (plural!) depicted in the game fails to elevate the game beyond more than a lazy commentary of sexual repression. It’s difficult to untangle the circumstances and controversy surrounding the game’s release from the content of the game itself. As a writer, I think censorship of creative work is Bad. I think Horses has as much right to exist as any other game, and that the power of distribution platforms to ban and delist a game by a small studio should be a concern for everyone. But the real problem with Horses is not that it’s too audacious for what is clearly intended to be an adult audience. Horses , for all the attention around its banning, is tedious and overreliant on pseudo-intellectual ideas. It confuses its own pretension for something profound.

However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

(2025)", "summary": "Optimize your sauna session by listening to the experts and, more importantly, your body.", "content": "Whether it’s post-workout or as part of a spa day, a sauna session can relax and enhance wellness. The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1765279864.1709907}

The “overwhelming majority” of the images involved nudity and were “depicted adult content,” according to the researcher who uncovered the exposed trove of data, with some appearing to depict children or the faces of children swapped onto the AI-generated bodies of nude adults. Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos. Photos stolen from social media can be edited in just a couple of clicks: leading to the harrowing abuse and harassment of women.

Thanks to its revolutionary Pleasure Air Technology that mimics the feeling of oral sex, not only has Womanizer discovered a way to stimulate the 10,000+ nerve endings in the clitoris in a way that hadn’t been done by a sex toy before—yes, they were the first—but the brand can even boast a 100% orgasm rate among users. As a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2 , both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance , the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm. But because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you. That’s where Womanizer coupons come into play—because no one should have to decide on just one of their fantastic sex toys. Cyber week has started at Womanizer. Time to get your groove on, for less.

The outside general counsel for USIP, he’s been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump’s right to remove them from office.

Though he cut his product-management teeth at Google and Stripe , he was never comfortable with the industry’s increasing prioritization of profits over people. Once during his time at Google, he extolled the societal benefits of a project only to be met with, “Oh Alex, you'd be a VP by now if you just stopped thinking through the implications of your actions.” Since that 2010s episode, the revenues and valuations in tech have skyrocketed, as has the blithe disregard for users. “It’s disgusting to see the industry as it currently is,” Komoroske says. Now, he’s doing something about it. Today, Komoroske and a loose group of concerned technologists are releasing The Resonant Computing Manifesto , an idealistic set of principles that attempts to recenter Silicon Valley around the values that have been lost in the scramble to hyperscale and maximize shareholder value. Komoroske and his coauthors are inviting anyone who, um, resonates with this jeremiad to sign it and proselytize those values in the products they create. Accompanying the manifesto is a shared doc of “the theses of resonant computing” where the community itself can provide input on shared principles. (Think: Martin Luther with a Google Workspace account.) “There are a lot of us who remember a Silicon Valley, a world of innovation, where we felt good,” Techdirt founder Mike Masnick, a coauthor of the manifesto, said during WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday during a panel announcing the manifesto. “A lot of us have noticed that we don’t get that feeling anymore.” Komoroske followed that up by saying that the manifesto is a response to cynicism, and that the values in it are ideals people in the Valley want to follow, even if it may not seem so on the surface. The idea for the manifesto emerged from an informal “think tank,” as Komoroske calls it, of technologists concerned about the state of Silicon Valley.

It also needs to make its software more usable. The way to do all that appears to be hiring design maestros away from Apple.", "content": "Meta has made a big move to hire two prominent designers away from rival tech giant Apple , likely putting them to work on designing Meta’s next generation of AI hardware and the software that runs on it. Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs. In a post on the Meta platform Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the two would lead the new studio and “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” In his own Instagram post, Sorrentino confirmed the news . (In response to a request for comment from WIRED, a Meta rep pointed toward the Threads posts by Zuckerberg and Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth .) Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface. If they want users to stay on their platform, they’re going to have to fix the UI.” The move comes as Meta continues to go absolutely all in on its AI efforts.

From India 's World Cup triumph to Gaza's terror, this article features all​", "content": "2025 was a year of sharp contrasts: tragedy and courage, despair and hope. Through ten powerful images from around the world, we revisit those moments that shook nations, inspired millions, or offered solace. The memories below follow the time they happened : in the order the world lived through them. On March 1, Ukrainian President met United States President at the White House. The meeting turned tense when the US leader accused Ukraine’s head of not showing enough gratitude for American support. One photograph froze the moment : a symbol of rising global tension amidst ongoing war. On April 22, terrorists struck tourists in the Baisaran valley in Pahalgam after demanding their religion. Twenty six people were killed. A single heart-rending image : of a widow grieving beside her husband’s body : captured the sorrow that reverberated across India. In the wake of the attack, India launched Operation Sindoor against terror bases across the border. A rare press briefing : led by two women officers, Colonel Sophia Qureshi and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh : was widely photographed. Those calm, resolute faces came to represent a nation’s fight against terror. On June 25, the private spaceflight Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) carrying Indian Air Force pilot Shubhanshu Shukla launched for the International Space Station (ISS). Shukla became the first Indian to reach the ISS. 18 days later, on July 15, he returned safely to Earth. Iconic photos from orbit and splashdown reignited national pride. On June 12, Air India Flight 171 crashed shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad, en route to London. All but one of the 243 on board perished. The aircraft struck a building, causing further casualties on ground. The resulting devastation was captured in stark images of wreckage and grief-stricken survivors. In September, a wave of anti-corruption protests erupted across Nepal after a sweeping ban on social media. Led by Gen Z and young citizens, the demonstrations turned deadly. Dozens died,", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/new-updates/10-landmark-photos-that-encapsulate-2025-from-operation-sindoor-trump-zelensky-meet-to-womens-world-cup-win/slideshow/125868672.cms", "timestamp": 1765279889.1221786}

Men’s skin deals with oil overload , breakouts, sun, and shaving stress. Dr Rashmi Shetty busts this myth: men’s skin may be thicker, but it’s still prone to oiliness, breakouts, dehydration and environmental damage. Men have 20–25% thicker skin because of testosterone, but that doesn’t make it tougher. Yes, this delays visible aging, but it also means more oil, larger pores, and deeper damage if ignored. Dr Shetty emphasizes: thicker skin still needs regular care, especially sun protection . Dr. Rashmi Shetty explains that male hormones stimulate sebaceous glands strongly. That means that their skin produces more sebum, which is why they often experience shine, clogged pores, and recurring acne. Dr Shetty highlights that even a basic routine cleanse, hydrate, sunscreen can drastically reduce acne. Daily shaving, outdoor exposure, and higher oil production weaken the barrier over time. Even thick skin loses strength without care. Dr Shetty stresses using lightweight hydration and sunscreen, the two steps that prevent premature aging and dullness. Men often don’t show early signs of aging due to collagen density . But once aging begins, it progresses quickly because damage accumulates silently for years. Dr Shetty says, start skincare early to slow that sudden shift. Dr Shetty suggests focusing on three essentials: cleanse away buildup, hydrate lightly, and shield the skin daily with SPF . She suggests focusing on three essentials: cleanse away buildup, hydrate lightly, and shield the skin daily with SPF.

Dr Shetty recommends lubricating shaving products, mild exfoliation, and lightweight moisturizers to minimize trauma. Dr Rashmi Shetty’s message is simple: men aren’t exempt from skincare .

The cause of the airline crash incident and any information about the casualties have not yet been confirmed by the news agency or official sources on Tuesday. The Russian military transport aircraft, which was carrying seven crew members on board, belonged to the Ministry of Defence of the country. The aircraft reportedly crashed into a waterbody; however, there is no information on any casualties so far, reported the news portal UNN on Tuesday. The Russian-made Antonov An-22 heavy military aircraft was designed for the sole purpose as a military transport vehicle, which flew for the first time back in 1965. According to the official Antonov website, the An-22 aircraft has the special capability of high flight performance and the ability to operate from unpaved runways, which made it easy for the USSR to deliver large-sized cargo and equipment to remote areas of the country. “A total of 66 airplanes were manufactured from 1965 to 1976. Since 1980, Antei had been using for transportation of oversized components for construction of the AN-124 Ruslan and AN-225 Mriya,” according to the company website.

On the occasion of 200th Jayanti of the valiant freedom fighter who played a key role in the revolt of 1857 — India's first struggle for Independence. The King of Rewari, Rao Tula Ram Singh was born on 9 December in 1825 in Haryana's Rampura suburb. A member of Ahir family, he was the son of Puran Singh and Gyan Kaur. He lost his father at a very young age. Considered a state hero, he fought against the oppressive British regime in the field of Nasibpur on outskirts of Narnaul, which famously came to be known as Battle of Narnaul. On 16 November 1857, Rao Tula Ram's cousin Rao Kirshan Singh led the armed forces to the battlefield. In this uprising, several British officers were killed or injured. However, Britisher's counter retaliation after the battle of Narnaul forced Rao Tula Ram to leave Haryana and move to Rajasthan. During this time, he joined the forces of Tantia Tope for a year, but he met defeat again in 1859 in the battle of Sikar in Rajasthan at the hands of British colonial rule. Determined to overthrow British colonial empire, Rao Tula Ram left India to seek help from the Shah of Iran, Dost Mohammad Khan ruler of Emirate of Afghanistan and Alexander II Emperor of All Russia against British colonial empire, following defeat in battle of Sikar. In the same year, British colonial rulers confiscated Rao Tula Ram's estates although proprietary rights of his two wives were retained. In 1877, his son Rao Yudhister Singh was made the head of the Ahirwal area, marking a restoration of Rao Tula Ram's title. Rao Tula Ram's died in Kabul in Afghanistan on 23 September 1863, at the age of 38 after suffering from an infection. On 23 September 2001, the Government of India issued a postage stamp featuring Rao Tula Ram as a tribute to the brave freedom fighter.

The accident occurred on Huaying Mountain, near Blade Rock, when the ground beneath him suddenly crumbled as he leaned forward for the shot. As reported by The Sun, other trekkers shouted in alarm and rushed toward the edge, and fortunately the man managed to survive after plunging into the trees below, sustaining only minor injuries. He later recounted the ordeal on social media, saying he felt “blessed by the mountain gods” and describing himself as fortunate to be alive after what he estimated was a 40-metre fall followed by a 15-metre slide down the slope. The widely circulated footage — now making the rounds across major social platforms and news outlets — has once again raised concerns about hazardous selfie habits. In the viral footage, other trekkers can be seen sprinting toward the cliff edge as startled witnesses shout in alarm. Local reports state that the man plunged roughly 15 metres into a patch of dense trees. Despite the dramatic fall, he emerged with no major injuries. According to the news outlet, the spot where the incident reportedly occurred — Blade Rock — lies outside the designated scenic zone. Authorities stressed that the location “is only allowed to be viewed from a distance and climbing is not permitted.” Similar episodes have surfaced in the past. In 2019, a woman in Gujarat survived a cliff fall at a hill station after slipping while taking a selfie, her descent slowed by thick bushes below. Not all incidents have ended safely; in 2018, a couple lost their lives at Yosemite National Park after plunging nearly 800 feet while attempting to take a photograph.

This limits its ability to flag risks early and reduces the scope for course correction while a project is underway. The CAG now plans to fix this with continuous monitoring.", "content": "This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the national auditor, is preparing to overhaul the way it audits government departments by moving from post-facto examination of accounts to real-time audits of public spending, project execution and service delivery. The shift marks one of the most significant changes to India’s audit architecture in decades, and comes at a time when governments are executing larger, technology-driven programmes that require closer and more continuous oversight. Under the existing system, most CAG audits are carried out after the end of a financial year. This limits its ability to flag risks early, and reduces the scope for course correction while a project is underway. The new approach aims to plug this gap by allowing the CAG to review data, documents and progress metrics as they are generated, instead of waiting for the project to end. According to a CAG official, who wished to remain anonymous, the institutional shift toward real-time and remote audits is already underway and the full rollout could begin by late 2025 or early 2026. Why is this change happening now? Traditional CAG audits are usually tabled one to three years after major decisions are made, which significantly reduces their usefulness for course correction. High-profile cases such as the 2G spectrum allocation and coal block allotments were audited well after the licences were issued, limiting the government’s ability to prevent losses, even though the audits later became politically significant. The 2G report, tabled in 2010, estimated a ₹ 1.76 trillion loss; the coal block audit in 2012 flagged potential gains of ₹ 1.86 trillion to private companies. But by then, the damage was already done. Several other less well-known CAG audits have also shown that if the findings had been available earlier—or during implementation—much of the damage could have been controlled.

Special Judge (PC Act) Vishal Gogne heard preliminary submissions by Senior Advocate Pavan Narang on the criminal revision petition and deemed it appropriate to seek the response of Gandhi and the Delhi Police, Bar and Bench reported. The court has also issued notice to the State and called for the trial court record (TCR). The matter has been listed for hearing on 6 January. The notice arises from a revision petition filed against a 11 September order in which a Delhi court dismissed a plea seeking action over Gandhi’s alleged appearance on the electoral roll three years before she became an Indian citizen. The Sessions Court will now re-examine whether the Magistrate’s dismissal was justified. The complainant, Vikas Tripathi , alleges that in January 1980 Sonia Gandhi’s name appeared as a voter in the New Delhi constituency, despite her not yet holding Indian citizenship. The petition argues that this inclusion was unlawful and requires a police investigation. What did the earlier court say when dismissing the complaint? The complaint was dismissed by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Vaibhav Chaurasia, who found no grounds to order an investigation under Section 175(4) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. Presenting arguments before the Magistrate, senior advocate Pavan Narang, appearing for the complainant, argued: “In January 1980 Ms. Gandhi's name was added as a voter of New Delhi constituency when she was not an Indian citizen.” He added: “First, you have to satisfy the threshold of citizenship, then you will become a resident of an area.” Narang suggested that in 1980 the proof of residence “was probably a ration card or a passport”.

In a Tuesday order, the DGCA asked IndiGo to revise its winter schedule and curtail the number of flights by 5%, including on high-frequency, high-demand routes. The airline has to submit its revised flight plans by 5 pm Wednesday (10 December). “The airline has not demonstrated an ability to operate these schedules efficiently (15014 weekly departures for winter schedule),” the regulator noted. “Therefore, it is directed to reduce the schedule by 5% across sectors, especially on high-demand, high-frequency flights, and to avoid single-flight operations on a sector by IndiGo.” “Furthermore, you are required to submit a revised schedule by 5 PM on 10th December 2025,” the notice added. The notice has been issued to the accountable manager of the airline. This follows IndiGo cancelling more than 2,000 flights over the past week, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. The airline cited a multitude of “unforeseen operational challenges”, primarily crew shortages triggered by new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FDTL) rules, which are designed to prevent pilot fatigue by capping flying hours and mandating rest periods. The DGCA's move marks an unprecedented exercise of its powers.

Ever since the release of the high-stakes movie on Friday, December 5, the track has been the most-discussed aspect of the movie. While the song is touted as Akshaye’s “entry song”. It is not exactly his entry in the film. The song happens when a rebel gang in Balochistan welcomes Akshaye Khanna . The viral track is titled FA9LA, a Bahranian song, written and performed by Flipperachi and Daffy, and composed by DJ Outlaw. The viral track from Dhurandhar , featuring Akshaye Khanna, is a hip-hop track in the distinct Khaleeji style. Sung in the Bahraini dialect, FA9LA means “fun time” or “party,” according to media reports. The “party” mode of the viral track may seem in contrast to Akshaye Khanna's vile character, Rehman Dakait, in Dhurandhar on the surface level. But Fa9la actually captures the Rehman Dakait to the core — he was someone who loved bloodshed and relished gory kills. For the infamous gangster, brutal killings were fun and a party. Hussam Aseem aka Flipperachi, the Bahraini rapper behind the viral song, is one of the most promising young voices in Arab hip-hop. According to media reports, citing his profile on LastFM, Aseem discovered his passion for music at 12 and developed his rap style as a teenager. In 2003, he began his professional career. Over the years, the rapper has collaborated with artists from around the world and won the Bahraini Artist of the Year award in 2024. Some of Flipperachi's biggest hits include Ee Laa, Shino AlKalam Hatha, Shoofha and Nayda. The aggressive beats, heavy bass and Arabic trap style of Fa9la has helped Akshaye Khanna's character to get an instant larger-than-life personality.

Speaking in a meeting at the White House, Trump expressed interest to introduce new tariffs on agricultural imports, particularly Indian rice and fertilizer from Canada. The US President's comments come at a time when farmers, his key support base, are faced with increasing costs and market challenges linked to tariff policies. Trump unveiled a $12 billion fresh aid for US farmers amid complaints that cheaper imports were making it difficult for their products to compete in the US markets. Trump, however, did not make it clear how much US tariffs will be imposed on Indian rice imports. India already pays 50% Trump tariffs on its goods, which were imposed in August as a punishment for its continued oil trade with Russia despite the Ukraine war.  “Why is India allowed to do that (dumping rice into the US)? They have to pay tariffs. Do they have an exemption on rice,” the US President asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. To this, Bessent replied, “No, sir. We're still working on their trade deal.” Trump said he would “take care” of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. Farmers have pointed to falling rice prices, claiming imports from countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand are undercutting their crops. “They shouldn't be dumping,” Trump said. “I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can't do that.”  While India pays 50% Trump tariffs on its exports to the US already, the new duties could mean more pressure ahead.

He, according to the NYT, combined a passion for scholarship with a detective’s eye for detail and the literary skills of a master storyteller.

The decision, disclosed by President Trump on his Truth Social platform amounts to a strategic shift in Washington DC’s management of the technological rivalry between the world’s two largest economies. Under the arrangement, Nvidia may ship H200 processors to China on the condition that the US government receives a 25% surcharge. According to a Commerce Department official cited by Bloomberg , this payment will be collected as the chips move from Taiwanese manufacturing facilities to the United States , where they will undergo security inspection by the Bureau of Industry and Security before re-export. Trump argued publicly that the plan would “protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” while also insisting that more advanced systems—Nvidia’s Blackwell and Rubin families—are excluded from the deal. This framework represents a notable departure from the blanket restrictions introduced in 2022 to deny Beijing access to the most sophisticated American AI hardware. It also builds on an earlier, unrealised proposal under which Nvidia and AMD would remit 15% of revenue from China chip sales to the US Treasury. According to Bloomberg , officials had been weighing the H200 decision for weeks. The final compromise reflects both political calculus and strategic pragmatism. Nvidia had lobbied for access to China to recover what Chief Executive Jensen Huang described as a US$50 billion market opportunity, while lawmakers struggled to balance commercial interests with national-security imperatives. Previous export-control thresholds had prevented Nvidia from selling its cutting-edge chips to China , prompting the company to develop downgraded versions such as the H20.

Here's how", "summary": "The recent USCIS update restricts new and renewal EADs to 18 months for specific immigrant groups.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently introduced an update to the Employment Authorization Document (EAD), often referred to as the work permit. This modification applies to specific groups of immigrants residing in the United States, including some individuals in the process of seeking permanent residency. However, the change is expected to affect those moving through the green card application process. Since December 5, USCIS has restricted the length of both new and renewal of EADs to a maximum of 18 months. Anyone who received an EAD before that date will keep the full validity originally granted, but when they apply for a renewal in the future, the updated 18-month limit will apply, according to a report by Newsweek.  According to Business Insider, these changes may lead to more frequent EAD renewals, which means additional filing fees, extra paperwork, and a heightened risk of employment interruptions if USCIS processing times stay slow. This could directly affect the job stability of green card applicants. To prepare, green card applicants—particularly those relying on an EAD while their adjustment of status is pending—should: 1. Submit their EAD renewal applications as early as possible; USCIS permits filing up to 180 days before expiration. 2. Organise all required documents in advance, such as their passport, I-485 receipt notice, and current EAD, and ensure their USCIS records are accurate. 3. Plan financially for potentially more frequent renewal fees. As of the time of publication, renewals can cost up to $605, though discounted rates are available for adjustment-of-status applicants. 4. Inform their employers about these changes to support compliance needs and timely I-9 re-verification.

Blair has been quietly dropped from consideration for the proposed advisory group or ‘ board of peace ’, which Trump has said he would chair himself, according to The Financial Times (FT). Blair was the only name publicly mentioned for a possible role on the council when President Trump announced his 20-point plan to end the Israel–Hamas war in September. President Trump had praised Blair as a ‘very good man.’ A month later, however, Trump said, “I’ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he’s an acceptable choice to everybody.” However, Blair's name for the role sparked reactions from Arab and Muslim countries. While Blair’s supporters said he had helped end years of conflict in Northern Ireland , his critics argued that he did very little in his role as the representative of the “Quartet” — the UN, EU, US and Russia — which was meant to push for peace in the Middle East, according to a report in The Guardian Many people across the Arab world view Blair with suspicion and anger because of his support for the US-led Iraq invasion in 2003. Reports about Blair's withdrawal come despite claims that he had an unpublicized meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late November to discuss plans, according to a report in The Times of Israel . The Financial Times report suggests, quoting sources, that Blair could still play a less central role in the proposed plan. Blair’s office has not yet commented on the reports. In another report, Jared Kushner , Donald Trump's son-in-law and former White House adviser, and Steve Witkoff, US Middle East envoy, will help oversee the post-war Gaza.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.
