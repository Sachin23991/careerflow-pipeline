Around 32,000 students were enrolled in these courses across the state when the Supreme Court, on November 5 last year, deemed the Uttar Pradesh madarsa education board’s practice of awarding Kamil (graduate-level) and Fazil (postgraduate-level) degrees “unconstitutional”, ruling that such authority lies only with universities regulated under the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act. For Saqlain Raza, a Fazil first-year student at Madarsa Jamia Farooquia in Varanasi, the ruling has forced a major shift. Raza, who has already cleared his first-year Fazil exam, is now preparing to join Kashi Vidyapeeth for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. “I have to think about my career.

As per the guidelines, only the top 2,50,000 successful candidates across all categories in the JEE Main 2026 BE/BTech paper will be shortlisted, in accordance with a fixed category-wise distribution. The institute has also reiterated conditions related to age, number of attempts and Class XII qualification. This year, the examination will be held on May 17, Sunday. Under Criterion A1, candidates must be among the top 2,50,000 performers in JEE Main 2026 (BE/BTech paper).

IIT Roorkee has clarified that the total may marginally exceed 2.5 lakh if “tied” ranks occur. IIT Roorkee has also noted that OCI/PIO (I) candidates are not eligible for any reserved category benefits, except under OPEN-PwD if applicable. They must qualify strictly in the OPEN lists. To be eligible, candidates must have been born on or after October 1, 2001. A relaxation of five years applies to SC, ST and PwD candidates, meaning they should have been born on or after October 1, 1996.

This means students must plan their Class 12 and JEE Main timelines carefully, as any earlier appearance than 2025 immediately disqualifies them from appearing in 2026. Candidates should have appeared in Class XII (or equivalent) for the first time in 2025 or 2026, with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as mandatory subjects.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIIT Kharagpur’s placement cycle for the years 2023, 2024, and the ongoing 2025 drive comes at a time when the institute’s leadership is publicly pushing for a shift in how students view their future careers. Speaking to The Indian Express recently, Director Prof Suman Chakraborty underlined that IIT graduates must “transform their viewpoint from being job seekers to being job creators” , stressing that the institute wants its students to look beyond conventional recruitment cycles and align themselves with broader innovation-led opportunities. Against this backdrop, IIT Kharagpur’s placement trends for 2023 and 2024 and the eventual outlook for 2025 reflect strong recruiter turnout, rising offer volumes, and continued interest from global technology, analytics, semiconductor, finance, and product companies. According to official data cited by media reports, IIT Kharagpur has seen steady growth in total offers over these three years, with major multinational firms, high-paying tech employers, and core engineering companies maintaining a significant presence in the recruitment process. The ongoing 2025 Phase 1 placement, as per reports, also indicates sustained demand for BTech graduates across specialisations. The 2025 placement drive, which began on December 1, 2024, has already crossed 1,800 offers, according to official data reported in the media. This indicates a healthy start compared to previous cycles. The highest package during this phase has touched Rs 2.14 crore per annum, offered by a global technology firm, continuing the institute’s trend of receiving crore-plus offers almost every year.

Speaking to The Indian Express recently, Director Prof Suman Chakraborty underlined that IIT graduates must “transform their viewpoint from being job seekers to being job creators” , stressing that the institute wants its students to look beyond conventional recruitment cycles and align themselves with broader innovation-led opportunities. Against this backdrop, IIT Kharagpur’s placement trends for 2023 and 2024 and the eventual outlook for 2025 reflect strong recruiter turnout, rising offer volumes, and continued interest from global technology, analytics, semiconductor, finance, and product companies. According to official data cited by media reports, IIT Kharagpur has seen steady growth in total offers over these three years, with major multinational firms, high-paying tech employers, and core engineering companies maintaining a significant presence in the recruitment process. The ongoing 2025 Phase 1 placement, as per reports, also indicates sustained demand for BTech graduates across specialisations. The 2025 placement drive, which began on December 1, 2024, has already crossed 1,800 offers, according to official data reported in the media.

During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

In 2021, the FTC banned Zuckerman from “offering, promoting, selling, or advertising any surveillance app, service, or business,” effectively preventing him from running another stalkerware business. The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses. “SpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,” said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company’s slipshod security.” In his petition , Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order’s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other “tourism ventures” in Puerto Rico, according to the petition.

The Alphabet-owned self-driving company has been coy ever since, simply stating it is providing many hundreds of thousands of weekly rides. Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was first reported by CNBC . The letter was an appeal for investment into Tiger Global’s next venture capital fund and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo. In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week — nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring. That number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too. Waymo, which provides commercial robotaxi service in five cities, has announced plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including Dallas, Denver, Houston, Nashville, and San Diego.

The Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor , to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales , CNBC reported. H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported. An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump’s hands . The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security. Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years. The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips. While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nGoogle announced on Monday that it’s introducing a shoppable discovery feed in Doppl , its experimental app that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you. The tech giant says the idea behind the new feed is to display recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with. The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms. It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction.

Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint.

Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.” The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors.

More than 230 organizations, including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. “The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. Several studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills. Electricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade.

The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests. The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work. Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat.

Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content. What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins.

Discovery (WBD), days after Warner agreed to be acquired by Netflix for $82.7 billion. Paramount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share. Paramount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. CNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago. “We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement . Paramount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo. Netflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months.

This is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant’s largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?” To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games. Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives. However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do.

Now, because of the legal action, OpenAI has temporarily scrubbed the “cameo” branding from its Sora app . The app now refers to the feature as “characters.” Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI , which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. In addition to being told to remove “cameo” from Sora, OpenAI was also recently ordered not to call its upcoming hardware device “io,” in response to a separate lawsuit from a company named “iyO” that’s already building an AI-powered hardware device. According to update logs on OpenAI’s website, the company removed the name for the Sora feature over a week after US District Judge Eumi K. Lee issued a temporary restraining order. The judge’s order blocked OpenAI from using “cameo” or variations of the word. The next hearing, which may decide whether this ban sticks, is scheduled for December 19. Discussions between Cameo and OpenAI have been “pretty nonexistent,” according to Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo. “They clearly knew Cameo existed. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “They chose the name anyway.” He sees this lawsuit as an “existential” battle over the word “cameo” and the app’s brand he has built over the past eight years. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic persona\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " In September, OpenAI launched a way for users to generate a digital likeness of themselves they could use to create personalized deepfake videos .

The app now refers to the feature as “characters.” Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI , which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. In addition to being told to remove “cameo” from Sora, OpenAI was also recently ordered not to call its upcoming hardware device “io,” in response to a separate lawsuit from a company named “iyO” that’s already building an AI-powered hardware device. According to update logs on OpenAI’s website, the company removed the name for the Sora feature over a week after US District Judge Eumi K. Lee issued a temporary restraining order. The judge’s order blocked OpenAI from using “cameo” or variations of the word. The next hearing, which may decide whether this ban sticks, is scheduled for December 19. Discussions between Cameo and OpenAI have been “pretty nonexistent,” according to Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo. “They clearly knew Cameo existed. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “They chose the name anyway.” He sees this lawsuit as an “existential” battle over the word “cameo” and the app’s brand he has built over the past eight years. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic persona"}

From tiny, $25 devices that will fit in a pocket, to massive, $400-plus boom boxes that require a built-in handle or shoulder strap, there’s a Bluetooth speaker for nearly every budget and gathering size. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for yet another model, as JBL proves with its new $100 JBL Grip. It’s essentially a smaller and lighter version of the company’s hugely popular Flip series, placing it between the Flip 7 and the JBL Go 4/Clip 5 on the portability scale. For some folks, that’s going to be the goldilocks zone. But just to sweeten the deal, JBL has reached into its toolbox and given the Grip an integrated LED light show, clearly inspired by the brand’s popular PartyBox lineup of party speakers. In keeping with JBL’s colorful approach to its smallest speakers, the Grip is available in red, white, black, purple, “squad” (a camo motif), and blue (pictured here). It’s 32 percent smaller than the JBL Flip 7— but it’s the Grip’s weight that will make throwing it in a backpack feel like an easy decision: At 0.8 pounds, the Grip is less than half the weight of the Flip 7 (1.8 pounds), making it light enough to hang from tree branches that would buckle under the Flip 7. JBL Grip Rating: 7/10 Despite the Grip’s smaller size, JBL pegs battery life on both speakers at the same 14-hour maximum. On the Grip at least, that might be overpromising. When I ran the speaker at 50 percent volume continuously, I only got about 10.5 hours. Using JBL’s PlayTime Boost mode could help if you really need to eke out a few more songs.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

As a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2 , both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance , the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm. But because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you.

When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change.

The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically. I don't know what it's going to change to, but it's what I'm spending almost every waking hour thinking about.” As a company, Cloudflare’s offerings are geared toward making it faster and safer to access content online. But as the AI industry has exploded and AI giants have emerged, Prince says he’s become increasingly focused on how Cloudflare can leverage its position to discourage consolidation and safeguard the internet as a place where businesses and creators of every size can survive—or, ideally, thrive. “We need to be able to make sure that businesses large and small flourish on a fair playing ground,” Prince said. “That is the future that we're trying to play for.

Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically. I don't know what it's going to change to, but it's what I'm spending almost every waking hour thinking about.” As a company, Cloudflare’s offerings are geared toward making it faster and safer to access content online. But as the AI industry has exploded and AI giants have emerged, Prince says he’s become increasingly focused on how Cloudflare can leverage its position to discourage consolidation and safeguard the internet as a place where businesses and creators of every size can survive—or, ideally, thrive. “We need to be able to make sure that businesses large and small flourish on a fair playing ground,” Prince said. “That is the future that we're trying to play for. That's the best thing for our business, because that's more people to be customers of ours. That's more internet for us to be able to protect.” Prince specifically highlighted concerns about Google’s policie"}

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nPost the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Moderation in deal intake, Q4 performance, and slow progress on margin trajectory led to EPS cut of 5-6% for FY25-26E. Valuation remains rich even after today’s ~10% price correction. We retain REDUCE with a TP of Rs3,700/sh at 34x Mar-25E EPS.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nDespite broadly stable 1.5% RoA over the last 7 quarters, CUBK’s stock has underperformed peers due to concerns about subdued loan growth / NIM performance in arguably one of the best NIM cycle in recent times. Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nHatsun reported highest gross margins in past 10 quarters underlining the cyclical recovery in margins due to lower milk procurement prices. We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

Speaking in a meeting at the White House, Trump expressed interest to introduce new tariffs on agricultural imports, particularly Indian rice and fertiliser from Canada. Trump unveiled a $12 billion fresh aid to farmers of America, some of whom complained that cheaper imports were making it difficult for their products to compete in the US markets. “Why is India allowed to do that (dumping rice into the US)? They have to pay tariffs. Do they have an exemption on rice,” the US President asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. To this, Bessent replied, “No, sir. We're still working on their trade deal.” Trump said he would “take care” of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. Farmers have pointed to falling rice prices, claiming imports from countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand are undercutting their crops. “They shouldn't be dumping,” Trump said. “I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can't do that.” The US President's comments came at a time when farmers, a key support base for Trump, are faced with increasing costs and market challenges linked to tariff policies.

John Wilford gave the NYT readers an awe-inspiring and comprehensive account of Apollo 11’s touchdown and exploratory mission on the moon’s arid Sea of Tranquillity under the front-page banner headline “MEN WALK ON MOON,” on 21 July 1969. “It was man’s first landing on another world,” he wrote, “the realisation of centuries of dreams, the fulfillment of a decade of striving, a triumph of modern technology and personal courage, the most dramatic demonstration of what man can do if he applies his mind and resources with single-minded determination.” He added: “The moon, long the symbol of the impossible and the inaccessible, was now within man’s reach, the first port of call in this new age of spacefaring.” John Wilford, a Kentucky-born journalist, worked at The Wall Street Journal and Time magazine before joining The Times in late 1965. He, according to the NYT, combined a passion for scholarship with a detective’s eye for detail and the literary skills of a master storyteller.

The decision, disclosed by President Trump on his Truth Social platform amounts to a strategic shift in Washington DC’s management of the technological rivalry between the world’s two largest economies. Under the arrangement, Nvidia may ship H200 processors to China on the condition that the US government receives a 25% surcharge. According to a Commerce Department official cited by Bloomberg , this payment will be collected as the chips move from Taiwanese manufacturing facilities to the United States , where they will undergo security inspection by the Bureau of Industry and Security before re-export. Trump argued publicly that the plan would “protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” while also insisting that more advanced systems—Nvidia’s Blackwell and Rubin families—are excluded from the deal. This framework represents a notable departure from the blanket restrictions introduced in 2022 to deny Beijing access to the most sophisticated American AI hardware. It also builds on an earlier, unrealised proposal under which Nvidia and AMD would remit 15% of revenue from China chip sales to the US Treasury. According to Bloomberg , officials had been weighing the H200 decision for weeks. The final compromise reflects both political calculus and strategic pragmatism. Nvidia had lobbied for access to China to recover what Chief Executive Jensen Huang described as a US$50 billion market opportunity, while lawmakers struggled to balance commercial interests with national-security imperatives.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently introduced an update to the Employment Authorization Document (EAD), often referred to as the work permit. This modification applies to specific groups of immigrants residing in the United States, including some individuals in the process of seeking permanent residency. However, the change is expected to affect those moving through the green card application process. Since December 5, USCIS has restricted the length of both new and renewal of EADs to a maximum of 18 months. Anyone who received an EAD before that date will keep the full validity originally granted, but when they apply for a renewal in the future, the updated 18-month limit will apply, according to a report by Newsweek.  According to Business Insider, these changes may lead to more frequent EAD renewals, which means additional filing fees, extra paperwork, and a heightened risk of employment interruptions if USCIS processing times stay slow. This could directly affect the job stability of green card applicants. To prepare, green card applicants—particularly those relying on an EAD while their adjustment of status is pending—should: 1.

This modification applies to specific groups of immigrants residing in the United States, including some individuals in the process of seeking permanent residency. However, the change is expected to affect those moving through the green card application process. Since December 5, USCIS has restricted the length of both new and renewal of EADs to a maximum of 18 months. Anyone who received an EAD before that date will keep the full validity originally granted, but when they apply for a renewal in the future, the updated 18-month limit will apply, according to a report by Newsweek.  According to Business Insider, these changes may lead to more frequent EAD renewals, which means additional filing fees, extra paperwork, and a heightened risk of employment interruptions if USCIS processing times stay slow. This could directly affect the job stability of green card applicants. To prepare, green card applicants—particularly those relying on an EAD while their adjustment of status is pending—should: 1. Submit their EAD renewal applications as early as possible; USCIS permits filing up to 180 days before expiration. 2.

The victim, Michael Virgil, aged 35, died in December 2024 while in custody aboard the ship, the lawsuit claims. His family alleges that on the day he died, crew members continued serving him alcohol at one of the ship’s bars, despite what they describe as clearly disturbing behaviour. The lawsuit contends that this excessive serving directly contributed to his worsening condition. According to court filings — as reported by media outlets — Virgil was later detained onboard following what is described as a “drunken rage,” during which he allegedly threatened crew members and other passengers. It was after this confrontation that his condition worsened and a medical emergency ensued. Following an investigation, the cause of death has been officially ruled a homicide. The family’s wrongful death lawsuit holds Royal Caribbean and the ship’s staff responsible for the events leading up to Virgil’s death. They argue that the company failed in its duty of care by allowing the continued supply of alcohol, ignoring signs of intoxication and negligence in handling a vulnerable passenger. Officially, neither Royal Caribbean nor any of its representatives have responded publicly to the lawsuit (as of the date of this writing). The family’s attorneys, however, insist they will seek full accountability, including compensatory damages for emotional distress and loss, and punitive damages aimed at prompting stronger safety protocols for cruise passengers.

State-run Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked transmission connectivity approvals for 6.3GW of green power capacity over delays in project development, Union minister of state for power Shripad Naik said on Monday. In a written reply to a query in Rajya Sabha, the minister said there were 16 petitions pending before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) that pertain to cases where the power generators have approached the regulator seeking protection from revocation of connectivity. \"Since 2022, Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked connectivity of 24 grantees with a renewable energy (RE) capacity of 6,343MW. The cancellations are on account of developer delays and not due to transmission side delays,\" the minister said. An Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for the evacuation of 172 GW of renewable energy is already under construction, and bids are in process for 19 GW capacity, he added. The Centre is also working with the states to ensure timely development of respective intra-state transmission systems for the evacuation of 152GW of renewable energy . \"These efforts, together with the planned transmission systems for integrating hydro, nuclear, and other non-fossil capacities, collectively provide a clear implementation plan for achieving the 500 GW non-fossil capacity target,\" the minister said.

In a written reply to a query in Rajya Sabha, the minister said there were 16 petitions pending before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) that pertain to cases where the power generators have approached the regulator seeking protection from revocation of connectivity. \"Since 2022, Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked connectivity of 24 grantees with a renewable energy (RE) capacity of 6,343MW. The cancellations are on account of developer delays and not due to transmission side delays,\" the minister said. An Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for the evacuation of 172 GW of renewable energy is already under construction, and bids are in process for 19 GW capacity, he added. The Centre is also working with the states to ensure timely development of respective intra-state transmission systems for the evacuation of 152GW of renewable energy . \"These efforts, together with the planned transmission systems for integrating hydro, nuclear, and other non-fossil capacities, collectively provide a clear implementation plan for achieving the 500 GW non-fossil capacity target,\" the minister said. The statement comes at a time when the renewable energy sector has been affected by curtailing of power generation and piling unsigned power purchase agreements. Mint had earlier reported that solar power producers in Rajasthan have dialled down production, after a congested grid prompted the regional regulator to step in. A total of nearly 44GW of renewable power is yet to find buyers and power purchase agreements have not been signed. Addition in transmission space has been lagging amid iss"}

Administration lawyers are defending Trump’s move to dismiss Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rebecca Slaughter without cause and are urging the Court to overturn the unanimous 1935 Humphrey’s Executor decision.

Despite objections from the three liberal justices, they permitted Slaughter and other agency board members to be dismissed while their lawsuits are still underway.

The incident — which is said to have occurred on December 5 at a Miraj Cinemas location — has raised concerns about public safety and appropriate behaviour in shared spaces. In the video, the man seated in the front row of the cinema hall is seen smoking a cigarette and consuming alcohol, disturbing others with the smoke and smell.

The Goa Police issued a statement on Monday, December 8 - day after the tragedy struck Goa club - and said that Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub owners fled to Phuket in Thailand at 5:30 am – hours after a massive fire erupted. They reportedly took an IndiGo airplane. Officials discovered the owners had fled after launching a large manhunt following the FIR.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nStudying abroad has traditionally meant spending a semester or even a year in a foreign country. But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.
