The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry.

The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

This initiative fulfils a key promise of Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann -led Punjab government to equip students in government and recognised schools with the mindset and practical skills for self-employment, startups and entrepreneurship, thereby fueling the state’s economic development, he added.  The CBI has filed a supplementary chargesheet in the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital case, naming whistleblower Akhtar Ali as a key player.

ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction. Germany has crossed 4 lakh international students in the 2024/25 winter semester, supported by dual-citizenship reforms. France aims to welcome 30,000 Indian students by 2030, pairing this target with clearer employment pathways. South Korea and the UAE are expa"}
{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAs CBSE gears up to offer class 10 students the option of giving board exams in select subjects twice from the 2026 exam onwards, CBSE Chairman Rahul Singh said that the Board expects a maximum of around 40% of students to appear in the second board exams in each of the main subjects. “We don’t expect…as a heuristic…we have taken that around 40% children will appear in each of the main subjects, in the second board exam, at max,” Singh said at a webinar on the CBSE two-board exam scheme on Thursday . Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nDr Gaurav Maheshwari When it comes to NEET (UG) , there’s one subject that can truly make or break your score: Biology. Out of 720 marks, a massive 360 marks come from Biology alone. That’s half the paper, making it the most decisive and scoring subject in the exam. But here’s the truth: Biology isn’t just about memorising lines from a textbook. It’s about understanding life itself. And when you truly understand it, cracking NEET becomes much easier. NEET UG 2026 Physics Preparation Tips to Score 180 Marks Biology beautifully unfolds into two fascinating branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany lets you explore the world of plants, their structure, diversity, colours, and the incredible processes that keep our environment balanced. It helps you understand how genes pass from one generation to another and how biotechnology enhances human life. NEET UG 2026 Chemistry Preparation Tips Zoology brings you closer to the inner workings of living beings, such as respiration, blood circulation, and reproduction. It’s a deep dive into how the human body maintains harmony every single second. Together, these branches not only help you score well but also allow you to appreciate how life thrives in every form around you. If you want to master NEET Biology, strategy matters as much as study hours. Here’s how you can prepare smartly: –Make NCERT your foundation. It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIIT Roorkee BTech placement trends: Over the past three years, IIT Roorkee’s placement landscape has unfolded alongside a noticeable shift in student preferences, a trend that the institute’s Director, Prof Kamal Kishore Pant, had earlier highlighted. Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe future of work in India is being dictated by its youngest professionals, but not in the way employers might expect. A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

Announced on Tuesday, the features allow users to purchase digital game items directly within Discord, eliminating the need to leave the platform. Users can also create wishlists for game items and send in-game items as gifts through direct messages. If Discord becomes a public company, it will face financial scrutiny, so these additions also present a new monetization opportunity for both Discord and game developers. By enabling developers to sell digital goods directly on Discord, the platform helps them reach a wider audience beyond their own communities, potentially boosting revenue. The initial rollout of these features is in partnership with the popular video game Marvel Rivals, which now has a dedicated store page within the game’s official Discord server. Marvel Rivals is a smart choice for this launch, as it garnered 10 million players within 72 hours of its release last year, generated over $100 million in its first month, and has built a community of more than 4 million members on Discord. Players can now browse and purchase in-game items directly from the Marvel Rivals server, which includes items such as bundles, costumes, emotes, and emojis. Additionally, users can create wishlists that friends can view and purchase as gifts. With the holiday season approaching, this feature is particularly timely, as it simplifies gift-giving for those looking to buy for gamer friends or family members. Plus, the ability to gift in-game items through DMs allows users to send gifts to friends even if they don’t play Marvel Rivals themselves.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAmazon has announced it’s launching a new service that completes deliveries in 30 minutes or less in Seattle and Philadelphia. The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart. Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company. Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99. Orders below $15 will include a small basket fee of $1.99. Customers in Seattle and Philadelphia can now check the Amazon app and homepage and look for the “30-Minute Delivery” option in the navigation bar to see if it’s available in their area. After placing an order, customers can track their deliveries and tip drivers through the app. “Amazon is utilizing specialized smaller facilities designed for efficient order fulfillment, strategically placed close to where Seattle- and Philadelphia-area customers live and work,” Amazon explained in a blog post . “This approach prioritizes the safety of employees picking and packing orders, reduces the distance delivery partners need to travel, and enables faster delivery times.” The move follows Amazon’s launch of a 15-minute delivery service in the United Arab Emirates in October. The company said at the time that some customers received their orders in as little as six minutes. The launch of the new service marks Amazon’s latest effort to enter the fast delivery market in the United States.

AWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nA Google Search exec said that one of the company’s biggest opportunities in AI lies in its ability to get to know the user better and personalize its responses. The promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service. In a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.” Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard . More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail , Calendar and Drive. But as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history , and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.

In a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.” Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard . More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail , Calendar and Drive. But as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history , and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations. That, Stein said, would be"}

According to Shopify’s status page , the company has found and fixed the issue. The disruption is particularly problematic given that customers were actively searching for deals on Cyber Monday, one of the busiest online shopping days of the year. Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company reports Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S. The issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. Shopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage. The exact number of affected merchants is unclear.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAmazon has announced a new family of frontier artificial intelligence models—and a new way for customers to build frontier models of their own. The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading.

While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change. Update: The $500 discount has sold out, however, you can still buy the Core Ultra 7 model for $650. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) The Surface Laptop has dropped by extra $50 just for Cyber Monday on Amazon, dropping it to a new all-time low price of $700. Not only is the lowest price we've ever seen on the Surface"}

Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nNetflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nOne of my favorite laptops to recommend, the Surface Laptop 13.8-inch , has now dropped to a new low price of $700. It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically.

The original V1 came out in 2006 , and the nameplate has been under constant production since. In that time, the DeathAdder has maintained its shape and ergonomics, but nearly everything else has changed. The mouse’s weight has halved, its polling rate has increased eightfold, and the maximum dots per inch (dpi) has increased by 25 times. To add to that, the new DeathAdder V4 Pro packs all of this into a wireless design. It's a great example of how far mouse technology has come over the past two decades. Over the years, I’ve watched mice progress in every way. With higher-performance sensors, improved switches, higher polling rates, and lower weights, it’s hard to argue that a mouse from 2006 is still competitive. At the same time, not all of those specs matter much to the average user. Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro Rating: 9/10 Sure, there’s a difference between 1,000- and 8,000-Hz polling, or 0.1 and 0.2 milliseconds of latency, but it's marginal compared to a new switch that feels better to press, a body that’s sturdy during use, or a design that saves 10 grams of weight. Time and time again, I find that the physical aspects of a mouse will have a much more direct and tangible impact on the user experience than any high-end internals. That’s what the DeathAdder V4 Pro gets right: It feels good to use. The buttons are snappy with a short travel distance but provide just enough resistance that resting your hand on them doesn’t risk a mis-input. The mouse wheel feels tight and notchy, with short ratchets that easily snap into place as you scroll. The overall shape is slightly sculpted, with a subtle ergonomic curve on either side.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nCyrus Yongbanthom has the aura single moms seem to love. A 29-year-old teacher and musician from Richmond, Virginia, Yongbanthom didn’t know much about Facebook Dating before creating a profile in 2023. Still, his matches sort of made sense. “It’s just a mom thing to be on Facebook, I guess,” he says of the perception around the social network . What Yongbanthom couldn’t figure out was why he also kept matching with people who were so far away. “No one is ever near me, which is interesting given there are so many users on Facebook Dating.” Twenty-one million users, actually. In November, for the first time since its launch in 2019, Meta shared with WIRED user information about Facebook Dating, and the figures landed to the sound of collective astonishment. Suddenly, the platform was a secret hit—and bigger than Hinge, its closest rival. Even more bewildering was how Facebook Dating seems to be slowly catching on among young people, with 1.77 million daily active US users between ages 18 and 29, a stat that challenges the idea that only boomers use Facebook.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring.

Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

The Giving Tuesday movement was started in 2012 as a simple idea: a day to encourage people to do good. It has since exploded into a global phenomenon, unleashing the power of radical generosity.

The products of the brand reportedly come with the care instructions: \"Please give it to your beloved woman, she knows everything.\" The care tag is written in both Chinese and English. However, it doesn't provide any washing instructions. According to multiple reports, the tag comes with two QR codes linking to the social media accounts of the brand.

The incident has gained mixed reactions from netizens. One of them was quoted saying by the South Morning China Post: “How come you let your beloved women do the chores for you? This is apparent exploitation.

The products of the brand reportedly come with the care instructions: \"Please give it to your beloved woman, she knows everything.\" The care tag is written in both Chinese and English. However, it doesn't provide any washing instructions. According to multiple reports, the tag comes with two QR codes linking to the social media accounts of the brand. South Morning China Post reported that the incident came to light from a coat made by Jiangsu-based Gu Zhuo Kang Zheng Garment Company. The same company owns brands like Labour Union, as per a report by Lizhi News. Meanwhile, the incident has created a storm on the internet after someone posted the tag online. It has now gone viral. The incident has gained mixed reactions from netizens. One of them was quoted saying by the South Morning China Post: “How come you let your beloved women do the chores for you? This is apparent exploitation.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has announced a major wave of demonstrations in Islamabad and Rawalpindi on Tuesday, protesting what it alleges are unlawful restrictions on access to former Prime Minister Imran Khan inside Adiala Jail. PTI leaders say they have been repeatedly denied permission to meet their incarcerated founding chairman, prompting the party to organise demonstrations outside both Adiala Jail and the Islamabad High Court (IHC). According to Dawn , the plan was finalised despite the authorities enforcing fresh curbs on public assembly. PTI leader Asad Qaiser told the publication that lawmakers from both houses of parliament would begin their protest outside the IHC before moving towards the jail. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” Qaiser said. Qaiser added that he would address a public gathering in Quetta on Tuesday, while advocate Gohar Ali Khan and other senior PTI figures would lead demonstrations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The PTI protests will unfold under a sweeping ban on public gatherings, implemented by both local and federal Pakistani authorities. The Rawalpindi district administration issued a three-day ban, effective Monday, while Islamabad’s administration imposed a two-month prohibition starting from 18 November. The move has been criticised by PTI as an attempt to suppress political opposition and prevent supporters from drawing attention to what they describe as a violation of Imran Khan’s fundamental rights. PTI maintains that Imran Khan’s family members and senior party leaders have been denied access to him for several weeks.

The stay order brings proceedings in the trial court to a halt while the apex court examines procedural concerns raised by the senior leader. The Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi passed the order after hearing Yediyurappa's petition challenging the Karnataka High Court's refusal to quash the case, the Bar and Bench report added. The bench also issued a notice to the Karnataka government, seeking its response to Yediyurappa’s plea. The limited question before the Court is whether he is entitled to have his petition heard on merits by the High Court—an issue Yediyurappa’s legal team argues was incorrectly foreclosed during earlier proceedings. In its order, the Supreme Court observed: “The coordinate bench has misconstrued the previous decision dated so and so while holding that in light of the decision in the previous round, the petition cannot be heard on merits. Hence, we issue notice for the limited purpose as to decide afresh in light of liberty granted to the petitioner, wide order date Feb 7, 2025.” Senior Advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Yediyurappa, earlier argued that the High Court had ignored key evidence. \"There are certain statements which prosecution suppresses.

If you don't want Sanchar Saathi, you can delete it. It is optional... It is our duty to introduce this app to everyone. Keeping it in their devices or not is up to the user,” he said to reporters. Notably, the clarification comes amid Opposition MPs voicing their strong protest against the compulsory installation of this app on smartphones. The backlash began after the Department of Telecom (DoT) directed phone manufacturers and importers to ensure that its Sanchar Saathi app, designed to detect fraud, is pre-installed in all new devices within 90 days. Notably, Reuters cited sources to report that US tech giant Apple plans not to comply with the mandate and will convey the same to New Delhi. Speaking to reporters on 2 December, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of dictatorship and infringing on the right to privacy of citizens, calling Sanchar Saathi a “snooping app”. The party has demanded that the government immediately roll back the app. “The Sanchar Saathi is a snooping app, and clearly it is ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family and friends without the government looking at everything,” she said, accusing the Centre of turning the country into a “dictatorship”. “It's not just snooping on the telephone.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nKing Charles has delivered another blow to his brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The monarch has removed the few royal honours the prince still held. The UK’s official public record confirmed that Andrew’s membership in the Order of the Garter has been cancelled. His Knight of the Grand Cross of the Royal Victoria Order has also been annulled. This latest step follows a series of actions against the disgraced royal. Andrew lost his “prince” title and was forced out of his Royal Lodge home in October. King Charles’ action came after continued backlash over Andrew’s links to Jeffrey Epstein . The removal of Andrew’s remaining titles now includes Prince along with Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh and His Royal Highness. According to Buckingham Palace, Charles started a formal process to strip Andrew of all remaining titles and honours. The Palace also stated that Andrew’s long lease at Royal Lodge had given him legal cover to stay there. But, he needs to shift to a private accommodation chosen by the monarchy. “THE KING has directed that the appointment of Andrew Albert Christian Edward MOUNTBATTEN-WINDSOR to be a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, dated 23 April 2006, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order,” says the formal statement. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” Buckingham Palace told Page Six. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” the statement added. Andrew is expected to vacate the Royal Lodge soon. He will shift to accommodation on the private Sandringham estate. Sarah Ferguson has lived at the property since 2008.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nStudying abroad has traditionally meant spending a semester or even a year in a foreign country. But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nStudying abroad is an exciting adventure—but for introverts, it can also bring a unique set of challenges. While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates.
