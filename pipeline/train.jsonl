{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nChina’s civil service exam saw a record 3.7 million candidates, showing how competition for government jobs is rising as the country faces high unemployment and an uncertain job market. The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service. But the surge in applicants and stiff competition also reflects broader socioeconomic pressures. Many in China, according to a Guardian report , appear to be turning away from unstable private-sector jobs in favour of government roles that still promise the much-coveted “iron-rice-bowl” of lifetime job security, even if pay is lower and growth slower.

The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D.

During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) .

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nNvidia announced new infrastructure and AI models on Monday as it works to build the backbone technology for physical AI, including robots and autonomous vehicles that can perceive and interact with the real world. The semiconductor giant announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research at the NeurIPS AI conference in San Diego, California. The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive. This new model is based on Nvidia’s Cosmos Reason model , a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August. Technology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post . Nvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do. This new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face. Alongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases.

Fans had high hopes for Brownlee’s foray into app development, given his reputation as an eagle-eyed tech reviewer who has amassed more than 20 million followers on YouTube. He’s so influential that some blamed his commentary on Humane AI and Fisker for those companies’ eventual failures. (We think the real issue is that you shouldn’t raise $230 million if you have no product.) Yet from the time Brownlee launched Panels in September 2024, the app struggled to find an audience of its own. “We knew it was niche, but we made mistakes in making our first app, and ultimately, we weren’t able to turn it into the vision I had,” Brownlee said in an unlisted YouTube video . In a blog post , he added that “the makeup of the development team changed,” and he was unable to find the right collaborators to grow the app. Brownlee was inspired to create Panels because when he posts video reviews of phones, tablets, and computers, fans always point out how stunning his wallpapers and lock screens are. When he first announced the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd …” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.” Panels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog. Thanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked No. 1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum.

Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, BloombergNEF said . Driving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers.

Europol confirmed the seizure in a press release , where it called Cryptomixer “the platform of choice for cybercriminals seeking to launder illegal proceeds from a variety of criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.” Since 2016, Europol said, Cryptomixer facilitated the laundering of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in Bitcoin. Hackers and other criminals use laundering services such as Cryptomixer to obfuscate and hide the provenance of their cryptocurrency. By design, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on public blockchains that allow law enforcement, as well as blockchain intelligence firms such as Chainalysis and Elliptic, to follow the money over time. Authorities said they seized $25 million euros ($29 million) in Bitcoin, along with three servers, 12 terabytes of data, and the official domain cryptomixer.io , which now displays the customary law enforcement seizure splash page. According to Europol, the site “facilitated the obfuscation of criminal funds for ransomware groups, underground economy forums and dark web markets,” and claimed its software “blocked the traceability of funds on the blockchain.” “Deposited funds from various users were pooled for a long and randomised period before being redistributed to destination addresses, again at random times.

Originally designed to add holiday lights to your Mac’s desktop, this popular indie app has been updated this year with several new features, most notably a version of the app that brings its sparkling, colorful lights to iOS devices for the first time. With the new Festivitas app for iPhone and iPad, you can add and customize a string of holiday lights on your device’s Home Screen using iOS widgets. The lights can frame your favorite personal photo (or perhaps a holiday image you dig up on Pinterest), and you can opt to make the widget transparent so it blends in with your background. While seasonal apps can sometimes be low-quality cash grabs, developer Simon Støvring puts genuine effort and thoughtfulness into Festivitas’ design — and doesn’t charge an arm and a leg, either. Instead, the app is available for free to consumers, with premium features that can be unlocked for a fair price of between $3.99 and $9.99. (You get to choose the price that works best for you.) On both macOS and iOS, you can customize the holiday lights in multiple ways, beyond picking their colors and flashing pattern. You can adjust the cable’s thickness, its drop width and height, and choose from pre-made color palettes like Candy Cane, Winter Snow, Elf, and others, or you can design your own. You can also make finer adjustments to things like the colors’ hue or temperature, the speed of the flashes, and the spacing between the lights. Another perk is that you’ll be able to use the lights again outside of the winter holidays, as you can now change the bulb shape to designs like a bat, clover, Easter egg, heart, ghost, star, “2026,” and more throughout the year.

Thrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services. Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but it will involve OpenAI sending employees from its engineering, research, and product teams to work within Thrive’s companies to accelerate AI adoption and boost efficiency. If those companies succeed, OpenAI’s stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to a source familiar with the matter. The partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave . For instance, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy Nvidia chips. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable.

By releasing early, Deezer beats other streaming music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, in providing an annual summary of listeners’ favorite songs, artists, albums, and genres for 2025. The feature, called “My Deezer Year,” offers users a detailed overview of their top tracks, top artists, favorite albums, and the amount of time spent listening to their most-played artist and their best track. This year’s edition introduces a new “romantic comedy” theme for the recap’s visual presentation. According to Deezer, as users explore their listening habits, they’ll feel as if they’re starring in a romantic comedy, complete with scenes like a “meet cute.” Deezer narrates the story as users navigate through it, teasing plot twists along the way. The experience is divided into three episodes. The first episode, titled “Meet Cute,” highlights the new artists users discovered throughout the year. The second episode, “Love Triangle,” features users’ top three artists, while the final episode, “Happily Ever After,” showcases their favorite tracks, along with a personalized playlist for continued listening.

The company said it first detected the unauthorized exposure of 4,500 user accounts on November 18, but a subsequent investigation revealed that the breach had actually compromised about 33.7 million customer accounts in South Korea. The breach affected customers’ names, email addresses, phone numbers, shipping addresses, and certain order histories, per Coupang. More sensitive data like payment information, credit card numbers, and login credentials was not compromised and remains secure, the company said. Coupang said it has reported the incident to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), and the National Police Agency. One of South Korea’s biggest e-commerce platforms, Coupang also offers a quick-commerce service called “Rocket Delivery” in the country, and also operates its marketplace in Japan and Taiwan. A Coupang spokesperson told TechCrunch that the investigation has found no evidence that consumer data from Coupang Taiwan or Rocket Now was affected in the data breach. “According to the investigation so far, it is believed that unauthorized access to personal information began on June 24, 2025, via overseas servers,” the company said. “Coupang blocked the unauthorized access route, strengthened internal monitoring, and retained experts from a leading independent security firm.” Police have reportedly identified at least one suspect, a former Chinese Coupang employee now abroad, after launching an investigation following a November 18 complaint.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWhen Will Bruey talks about the future, the timelines are shorter than most might imagine. The Varda Space Industries CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class employee to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth. The reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX. “I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event . The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.” Varda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit — crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication — joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since. The company brings its pharmaceuticals back to Earth inside the W-1 capsule, a small, conical spacecraft about 90 centimeters across, 74 centimeters high, and weighing less than 90 kilograms (roughly the size of a large kitchen trash can). The company this week launched its most recent capsule aboard a SpaceX ride-share mission, hosted by a spacecraft bus that provides power, communications, propulsion, and control while in orbit.

However, Sacks fired back in a post on X , in which he described a five-month reporting process in which accusations were “debunked in detail.” “Today they evidently just threw up their hands and published this nothing burger,” Sacks said. “Anyone who reads the story carefully can see that they strung together a bunch of anecdotes that don’t support the headline.” This isn’t the first time critics have suggested that there may be conflicts of interest between Sacks’ political role and his investments. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren — a Democrat from Massachusetts — said earlier this year that Sacks “simultaneously leads a firm invested in crypto while guiding the nation’s crypto policy,” an “explicit conflict of interest” that would “normally” be prohibited under federal law. But the NYT’s story (under the headline “Silicon Valley’s Man in the White House Is Benefiting Himself and His Friends,” and credited to five bylined reporters) seems to offer a more comprehensive view, with an analysis of his financial disclosures suggesting that among Sacks’ 708 tech investments, 449 are AI companies that could benefit from the policies he supports. Sacks has received two White House ethics waivers declaring he would sell most of his crypto and AI assets. However, the NYT said his public ethics filings do not disclose the remaining value of his crypto and AI investments, nor do they say when he sold off the assets he divested. Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor specializing in government ethics, made similar points in July after reviewing Sacks’ crypto waiver, telling TechCrunch , “This is graft.” The NYT also said that Sacks’ filings classify hundreds of investments as hardware or software, rather than AI, while the companies pitch themselves as AI b\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " David Sacks’ role as President Donald Trump’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar could work out very well for his investments, as well as his friends, according to a new report The New York Times .

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nMy little theory is that the concept of “imprinting” in psychology can just as easily be applied to programming: Much as a baby goose decides that the first moving life-form it encounters is its parent, embryonic programmers form ineradicable attachments to the patterns and quiddities of their first formative language. For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described.

For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described.

The original V1 came out in 2006 , and the nameplate has been under constant production since. In that time, the DeathAdder has maintained its shape and ergonomics, but nearly everything else has changed. The mouse’s weight has halved, its polling rate has increased eightfold, and the maximum dots per inch (dpi) has increased by 25 times. To add to that, the new DeathAdder V4 Pro packs all of this into a wireless design. It's a great example of how far mouse technology has come over the past two decades. Over the years, I’ve watched mice progress in every way. With higher-performance sensors, improved switches, higher polling rates, and lower weights, it’s hard to argue that a mouse from 2006 is still competitive. At the same time, not all of those specs matter much to the average user. Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro Rating: 9/10 Sure, there’s a difference between 1,000- and 8,000-Hz polling, or 0.1 and 0.2 milliseconds of latency, but it's marginal compared to a new switch that feels better to press, a body that’s sturdy during use, or a design that saves 10 grams of weight. Time and time again, I find that the physical aspects of a mouse will have a much more direct and tangible impact on the user experience than any high-end internals. That’s what the DeathAdder V4 Pro gets right: It feels good to use. The buttons are snappy with a short travel distance but provide just enough resistance that resting your hand on them doesn’t risk a mis-input. The mouse wheel feels tight and notchy, with short ratchets that easily snap into place as you scroll. The overall shape is slightly sculpted, with a subtle ergonomic curve on either side.

It was the first brand on the market to introduce AI bird identification, as well as the first to introduce auxiliary products like smart nesting boxes , birdbaths (see below), and feeder bodies made from different materials like wood or metal. The products still suffer the occasional quirk or connectivity issue, but all smart feeders do. The Birdfys remain my go-to for gifts and personal use at my home due to their consistency and ease of use. If you're looking to buy one this year for yourself or a loved one, these are the best prices you'll see, and these are the most giftable models, most usable out of the box without a subscription.

I know multiple people who were gifted a smart bird feeder last year for the holidays and still, in November 2025, have yet to take it out of the box. Apparently they're not alone, because there's now a feeder specifically for the reluctant: the Rookie, which looks like a gravity pet feeder and snaps together in three simple pieces with no tools.

It was the first brand on the market to introduce AI bird identification, as well as the first to introduce auxiliary products like smart nesting boxes , birdbaths (see below), and feeder bodies made from different materials like wood or metal. The products still suffer the occasional quirk or connectivity issue, but all smart feeders do. The Birdfys remain my go-to for gifts and personal use at my home due to their consistency and ease of use. If you're looking to buy one this year for yourself or a loved one, these are the best prices you'll see, and these are the most giftable models, most usable out of the box without a subscription.

I know multiple people who were gifted a smart bird feeder last year for the holidays and still, in November 2025, have yet to take it out of the box. Apparently they're not alone, because there's now a feeder specifically for the reluctant: the Rookie, which looks like a gravity pet feeder and snaps together in three simple pieces with no tools.

In one passage, the Signal Festival has a cameo appearance when the novel’s protagonist recalls attending an event at the 2024 edition. “We’re happy about it,” festival director Martin Pošta says about the mention. “It’s a kind of recognition.” Not that the event needed promotion, even in one of the most anticipated novels of recent years. The organizers have yet to share the number of visitors to the festival this year, but the four-day event typically attracts half a million visitors. On the final day, there was a long queue in front of the monumental installation Tristan’s Ascension by American video art pioneer Bill Viola before it opened for the evening, even though it was a ticketed event.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

According to a report by The Guardian , industry sources estimate it could cost about £3bn in higher spending on drugs over the next three years. However, they also noted that the deal could increase the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines for diseases such as breast cancer, asthma and motor neurone disease, where innovation is key. In return, UK will be exempted from hefty US tariffs imposed on pharma imports that entered force on October 1. It is the only country to reach such a deal as European Union and Switzerland continue to face pharma tariffs totalling 15%. Here's a glimpse at the key highlights of the deal: The accord aims to \"address long-standing imbalances in US-UK pharmaceutical trade,\" ending what US trade ambassador Jamieson Greer called an arrangement where “American patients have been forced to subsidise prescription drugs and biologics in other developed countries,” reported AFP. British Science and Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the US-UK pharma deal will ensure that UK patients get access to medicines faster.

The ruling, delivered in absentia, accuses Panahi of “propaganda activities” against the Iranian regime — a familiar charge in repeated legal cases against the director over the years. The verdict comes just months after Panahi — aged 65 — achieved one of the greatest accolades in world cinema. His latest film, ‘It Was Just an Accident’, won the 2025 Cannes Film Festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or. In that film, a group of former inmates confront a man they believe to be their former jailer, a story that many critics see as a sharp allegory for state repression and a bold act of cinematic defiance. Panahi had spent much of the past two decades navigating severe restrictions: after openly supporting anti-government protests in 2009, he was convicted in 2010 of “propaganda against the system” and received a six-year prison sentence as well as a 20-year ban on filmmaking , international travel, and media appearances. Undeterred, he refused to remain silent. During his house arrest, he co-directed ‘This Is Not a Film’ (2011), a stark documentary made in his apartment that was smuggled out of Iran on a USB drive and screened at Cannes — a daring act of artistic resistance.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nDonald Trump's former personal attorney Alina Habba, has been disqualified from serving as attorney for New Jersey, a federal appeals court in the US ruled on Monday. Calling Habba a “tireless advocate for justice” in his statement last year and who had been \"unwavering in her loyalty,\" Trump had named Habba as interim US Attorney General for New Jersey in March. On Monday, 1 December, a three-judge panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Habba was unlawfully appointed as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey and disqualified her from supervising cases. Alina Habba – 41-years-old – was once a relatively lesser-known litigator who came to represent Trump in some of his most perilous cases – including one, where she notably clashed with a judge during a defamation trial, mentioned a report by BBC. After graduating from university, Habba took a job in the fashion industry, working at Marc Jacobs - one of America's premier brands. She returned to college after several years in the industry, earning her law degree from Widener University, a small school in Pennsylvania, in 2010. She went on to serve briefly as a clerk for then–New Jersey Superior Court Judge Eugene Codey Jr before shifting to private practice. After several years in the field, she founded her own law firm in 2020. A mother of three – Habba – joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his country club in Bedminster, New Jersey - where her law firm is also based. The latest disqualification of Habba as New Jersey attorney comes amid the push by Trump's Republican administration to keep Habba as the acting US attorney for the state – a powerful post charged with enforcing federal criminal and civil law, reported AP.

Short-term appointments could be for one year, depending on the post or nature of work, and are generally made directly by the regulator. Of the sanctioned 1,630 posts at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), 801 posts are vacant, minister of state for civil aviation Murlidhar Mohol informed the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Previous submissions made in the Lok Sabha showed that 814 out of 1,692 sanctioned positions at the DGCA remained vacant as of 31 March 2025. DGCA had 878 staff as of 31 March 2025. “...to meet the requirement in the interregnum, efforts are made to recruit persons through short term contractual hiring. Regular efforts are made to address and augment technical manpower shortage, enhanced training and succession planning,” Mohol said in a written response to the upper house of Parliament. He said 441 posts have been created during “the last 3 years as a part of DGCA restructuring”. “Out of total 1,630 sanctioned strength of DGCA, 829 posts are currently filled,” Mohol said, adding that the “shortfall has not impacted the surveillance plans of DGCA.” On 21 July 2025, about 40 days after the Air India crash that killed 241 people and raised concerns over the DGCA’s chronic staffing shortages, Mohol said the regulator had created 441 new posts between 2022 and 2024, including 426 technical roles. Of the DGCA’s 1,644 sanctioned posts, 823 remain vacant. Thus, between July and November, there has been a reduction in sanctioned posts by about 1%, while vacancy levels remain around 50%.

This year’s display features no fewer than 51 Christmas trees across the White House. The official tree — an 18½-foot concolor fir from Korson's Tree Farms in Michigan — will take pride of place in the Blue Room, as is tradition. The fir was delivered in horse-drawn carriage by a pair of Clydesdale horses, a nod to nostalgic festive pageantry. The Blue Room tree carries special significance this year: it honours “Gold Star” families — families who have lost loved ones in active military service. The decorations include more than 2,800 gold stars, plus ornaments representing each U.S. state’s official bird and flower, symbolising hope, unity and remembrance. Meanwhile, the Green Room takes on a playful, family-orientated spirit. Here, the décor transforms the space into a kind of “game room,” with playing cards, dominoes and even LEGO portraits of two U.S. presidents — the country’s first, George Washington, and the incumbent, Donald Trump — each crafted from over 6,000 LEGO pieces. In the State Dining Room, a striking gingerbread model of the White House — built from 120 pounds of gingerbread dough — gives an edible (though not to be eaten) miniature recreation of the mansion’s South Portico and offers a peek inside the private residence’s Yellow Oval Room.

The revelation came in response to a starred question asked by Rajya Sabha member S Niranjan Reddy in the Parliament Winter Session that began on Monday. Reddy asked the Civil Aviation Minister in the Rajya Sabha to answer \"whether the government is aware of recent incidents of GPS spoofing reported at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), New Delhi and the steps taken by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Airports Authority of India (AAI) to investigate and mitigate such incidents in future\". According to cybersecurity software company McAfee, GPS spoofing is a practice in which a GPS receiver is manipulated or tricked to broadcast false GPS signals. By tampering with the signals, the receiver can be misled into showing incorrect coordinates — in some cases, placing the device in a completely different location than where it actually is. “This form of cyberattack undermines the reliability of GPS data, which is vital for a variety of applications, from navigation to time synchronisation and more,” according to the cybersecurity software firm.

A formal complaint under FEMA was filed on June 27, 2025. After examining the matter, the adjudicating authority issued the notices. The development marks a significant escalation in the ongoing inquiry surrounding KIIFB's financial operations and borrowing practices through international markets.

The glitch affecting the Airbus A320 family of aircraft affected the system controlling the nose angle or 'angle of attack' of flights, which is a critical part of the flight-control system.

The glitch came to light after a JetBlue Airbus A32 aircraft flying from Cancun in Mexico to Newark in the US unexpectedly lost altitude, leading to the passengers sustaining injuries.

So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success.
