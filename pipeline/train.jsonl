The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris.

Speaking at a government programme, he said the education department has already appointed 6,998 teachers and allied staff since 2018. Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said. The government is also working to finalise a transparent transfer policy, he said. “A government doctor (MBBS) is required to serve three years in a rural hospital to get a chance to pursue MD or MS. Now, we are planning to introduce a marking system for postgraduate aspirants serving in rural hospitals,” he added.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nEighty-eight Indian institutions have featured in the Times Higher Education (THE) Interdisciplinary Science Rankings (ISR) 2026, making India the most represented country on the global list. The ISR 2026 ranks 911 universities across 94 countries, up from 749 in the first edition. While premier institutions like IITs continue to boycott the THE ranking , Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences emerged as the top-ranked university from India, securing the 57th position globally. It is closely followed by VIT University at rank 59 and Anna University at joint 67th place. Jamia Millia Islamia, positioned at 80, leads the performance among central universities, while SRM Institute of Science and Technology (89) and Amity University, Noida (97) also feature within the global top 100. Times Higher Education is a UK-based magazine that releases an annual ranking of global and Asian universities, among others. The rankings, conducted in association with Schmidt Science Fellows, aim to benchmark how universities foster research that cuts across traditional academic boundaries. One of the key changes in this year’s edition is an expanded definition of “interdisciplinary science.” In addition to traditional STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) research, ISR 2026 now includes projects that combine scientific disciplines with non-STEM fields such as social sciences, law, economics, education, and clinical health.

While premier institutions like IITs continue to boycott the THE ranking , Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences emerged as the top-ranked university from India, securing the 57th position globally. It is closely followed by VIT University at rank 59 and Anna University at joint 67th place. Jamia Millia Islamia, positioned at 80, leads the performance among central universities, while SRM Institute of Science and Technology (89) and Amity University, Noida (97) also feature within the global top 100. Times Higher Education is a UK-based magazine that releases an annual ranking of global and Asian universities, among others. The rankings, conducted in association with Schmidt Science Fellows, aim to benchmark how universities foster research that cuts across traditional academic boundaries. One of the key changes in this year’s edition is an expanded definition of “interdisciplinary science.” In addition to traditional STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) research, ISR 2026 now includes projects that combine scientific disciplines with non-STEM fields such as social sciences, law, economics, education, and clinical health.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Siddharth Garg There is a widely believed misconception amongst students and parents, that if a student prepares rigorously for the Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), they will have to give up their preparation for the board exams . There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments.

The Varda Space Industries CEO predicts that within 10 years, someone could stand at a landing site and watch multiple specialized spacecraft per night zooming toward Earth like shooting stars, each carrying pharmaceuticals manufactured in space. Within 15 to 20 years, he says, it will be cheaper to send a working-class employee to orbit for a month than to keep them on Earth. The reason Bruey thinks these scenarios are realistic is because he has watched ambitious business projections unfold before, while working as an engineer at SpaceX. “I remember the first rocket I worked on at SpaceX was flight three of Falcon 9,” he said at TechCrunch’s recent Disrupt event . The partially reusable, two-stage, medium-lift launch vehicle has since completed nearly 600 successful missions. “If someone had told me ‘reusable rockets,’ and ‘[we’ll see as] many [of these] flights as daily flights out of LAX,’ I would have been like, ‘All right, [maybe in] 15 to 20 years,’ and this feels the same level of futuristic.” Varda has already proven the core concept. In February 2024, after a months-long regulatory odyssey, the company became only the third corporate entity ever to bring something back from orbit – crystals of ritonavir, an HIV medication – joining SpaceX and Boeing in that exclusive club. It has completed a handful of missions since. The company brings its pharmaceuticals back to Earth inside the W-1 capsule, a small, conical spacecraft about 90 centimeters across, 74 centimeters high, and weighing less than 90 kilograms (roughly the size of a large kitchen trash can).

The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders. Founded in 2015, Meesho began as a social commerce platform that targeted first-time online shoppers through WhatsApp before evolving into a full-fledged marketplace .

The 13th edition of the Signal Festival , which took place from October 16 to 19, presented 20 installations by Czech and international artists, including projections on a cloud of mist and interactive objects that responded to the movements of viewers.

In one passage, the Signal Festival has a cameo appearance when the novel’s protagonist recalls attending an event at the 2024 edition. “We’re happy about it,” festival director Martin Pošta says about the mention. “It’s a kind of recognition.” Not that the event needed promotion, even in one of the most anticipated novels of recent years. The organizers have yet to share the number of visitors to the festival this year, but the four-day event typically attracts half a million visitors. On the final day, there was a long queue in front of the monumental installation Tristan’s Ascension by American video art pioneer Bill Viola before it opened for the evening, even though it was a ticketed event.

In May 2014, NASA announced at a press conference that a portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appeared to have reached a point of irreversible retreat. Glaciers flowing toward the sea at the periphery of the 2-kilometer-thick sheet of ice were losing ice faster than snowfall could replenish them, causing their edges to recede inland. With that, the question was no longer whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would disappear, but when. When those glaciers go, sea levels will rise by more than a meter, inundating land currently inhabited by 230 million people . And that would be just the first act before the collapse of the entire ice sheet, which could raise seas 5 meters and redraw the world’s coastlines. At the time, scientists assumed that the loss of those glaciers would unfold over centuries. But in 2016, a bombshell study in Nature concluded that crumbling ice cliffs could trigger a runaway process of retreat, dramatically hastening the timeline. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) took notice, establishing a sobering new worst-case scenario: By 2100, meltwater from Antarctica, Greenland, and mountain glaciers combined with the thermal expansion of seawater could raise global sea levels by over 2 meters . And that would only be the beginning. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, seas would rise a staggering 15 meters by 2300. However, not all scientists are convinced by the runaway scenario. Thus, a tension has emerged over how long we have until West Antarctica’s huge glaciers vanish. If their retreat unfolds over centuries, humanity may have time to adapt.

Studies have repeatedly shown that people with vulvas need clitoral stimulation to orgasm, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the first clitoral suction toy hit the market.

Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more.

Head to our full roundup for more Black Friday deals . Updated November 29: We've added some deals from Moment's sale. Do You Need a New Camera? Probably not. Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more. Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That’s a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows.

There’s a lot to like about it. The M5's performance is a solid step up over the M4 , especially in the GPU department. The stuff that hasn’t changed is still really high-quality, including the Mini-LED display, excellent speakers, and iconic design. It’s been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect. It’s even $200 off this Black Friday weekend , despite launching only a month ago. Best Black Friday Tech Deals (2025) Explore the story The problem is the position of this particular MacBook Pro in the lineup. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That’s a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air. Apple knows people will buy the MacBook Air this"}

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, attacks immune cells. If left untreated, it weakens the body's defense system until it reaches Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. This happens when CD4 cell counts (most notably helper T cells, which are crucial for coordinating the immune response against infections) drop below 200. Early testing and treatment prevent this progression entirely. Right after exposure, people often feel flu-like. Fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes appear. Some notice a rash. These symptoms fade, but the virus multiplies silently. Testing during this window catches infection early. Some feel nothing initially. Only testing confirms status. Don't assume or delay. HIV hides in cells. People feel healthy but remain contagious. Without treatment, this lasts years. A blood test reveals viral load and CD4 count. Regular monitoring guides treatment decisions. Starting antiretroviral therapy now prevents immune damage and keeps viral load undetectable. CD4 count drops below 200. The immune system fails. Opportunistic infections develop. Tuberculosis, certain cancers, and fungal infections appear. Even at this stage, antiretroviral therapy works, rebuilding immunity and preventing death.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWorld AIDS Day marks December 1 each year to raise awareness and remember those lost to HIV and AIDS. This year's theme focuses on building resilient health systems despite global disruptions. The real game-changer? Modern treatment transforms HIV from a death sentence into a manageable chronic condition for those with access to care. The Reality: HIV cannot spread through hugging, handshakes, sharing meals, or using the same bathroom. The virus requires direct contact with specific bodily fluids like blood or semen. Everyday social interaction is completely safe. Stigma built on this falsehood keeps people from seeking support. The Reality: They're different stages. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that weakens your immune system. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) develops after years if HIV remains untreated. Early detection and medication prevent this progression entirely nowadays. The Reality: Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) allows people with HIV to live near-normal lifespans. Those on consistent treatment maintain healthy immune function and rarely develop AIDS-related illnesses. It's now managed like diabetes or hypertension, not a terminal condition anymore. The Reality: HIV doesn't discriminate by age, gender, background, or sexual orientation. Anyone can contract it through unprotected sex or needle-sharing. Believing \"it won't happen to me\" creates false security and delays testing when exposure occurs. The Reality: Insects cannot transmit HIV.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAcidity isn’t “normal.” That sudden burn in your chest, throat irritation, or sour taste after meals can actually be a sign of GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), says Dr Shriram Nene. Let's break it down and see what it really means, how it happens, and how to fix it. Burning in your chest isn’t “normal acidity.” That fiery, rising sensation is your body reacting to acid travelling upward. According to Madhuri Dixit’s husband Dr Shriram Nene, reflux often happens due to overeating, late meals, or weakened digestive muscles. When it keeps returning, it may signal chronic GERD . Dr Shriram Nene says that reflux starts when the LES relaxes more than it should. And when it fails to stay tightly closed , stomach acid comes up and irritates your throat and chest. This malfunction is the main cause behind continuous heartburn and reflux symptoms. Even simple things can trigger reflux, explains Dr Nene. Spicy meals, oily food, caffeine, carbonated drinks, and late-night eating are the biggest offenders . If you notice burning after these foods, you’re not imagining it - your body is reacting to known reflux triggers. Acid doesn’t just cause burning - it injures tissue. Dr Shriram Nene explains that untreated reflux repeatedly burns the esophagus, leading to swelling, ulcers, chronic throat irritation, and nighttime coughing. Early management prevents long-term issues. He recommends eating carefully, staying hydrated , avoiding lying down after meals, drinking less alcohol and soft drinks, and choosing light dinners. Avoid wearing tight waistbands and smoking. These regular habits make your digestive system strong and prevent acid from rising. Choose foods that support digestion, not stress it out. Dr Nene recommends bananas, cucumbers, yogurt , oatmeal , coconut water, and soft khichdi. Avoiding oily, spicy, and fried items makes these foods even more effective in calming the digestive system . Dr Shriram Nene says persistent acidity isn’t something to ignore.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nSeeds are tiny but powerful when used correctly. Not all seeds act the same in your stomach. Some need soaking, some need grinding, and some work only in specific amounts. This guide explains exactly how to use seeds so they help your digestion, not confuse it. Chia’s benefits come from its soluble fiber . Dr Sethi explains that chia expands up to 10–12 times in water. Eating them dry can cause bloating, gas, and even choking in some cases. Always hydrate it first; that’s when the gut-friendly benefits become active. Flax has a tough outer shell your stomach can’t digest. He says that whole flax seeds don’t break down during digestion, meaning you absorb none of the nutrients. Grinding them makes fibers like omega-3s , lignans, and gut-friendly fiber work more nicely. Grind small batches and refrigerate to keep the oils stable . Pumpkin seeds have zinc, magnesium , and protein, but Dr Sethi also says that they are calorie dense and easy to overeat. Eat one small serving to avoid bloating. Light roasting improves digestibility and enhances mineral absorption, making them gut-friendly when eaten carefully. Sunflower seeds support skin and immune health , but Dr Sethi explains that their high omega-6 content requires moderation. Eating too much of them can lead to inflammation if your diet lacks omega-3s . Eat small portions, choose unsalted versions, and balance them with omega-3 sources like chia or flax . Sesame seeds have a lot of nutrients , but he recommends roasting or grinding them for better digestion. Their natural oils help lubricate the intestines, easing constipation, while the fiber improves motility. One to two teaspoons is enough for anyone. Dr Sethi also mentions that seeds aren’t immortal; heat, light, and air break down their oils. Once they turn rancid, they’re no longer healthy for your gut .

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

With the 6 December cut-off fast approaching, the Court’s decision places the onus squarely on property-holders to pursue remedies through the statutory mechanism created by the amended law. A Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih held that the applicants already had a clear and adequate remedy under the 2025 Act. “Since a remedy for the applicants is already available before the Waqf Tribunal, they may seek the same by December 6, which we are informed is the last date for the registration of property,” ANI quoted the court. The Supreme Court Bench emphasised that the judiciary could not intervene when Parliament had expressly created a forum for addressing disputes arising from the registration process. Counsel appearing for the petitioners argued that procedural hurdles were preventing timely registrations. These, they said, extended beyond the mere act of uploading details on the UMEED portal. According to ANI, the petitioners highlighted problems linked to the digitisation of Waqf property records, technical errors on the portal, and potential delays in the Tribunal’s ability to consider applications before the deadline lapses.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said, “He said he did not say that, and I believe him 100%.” The Pentagon is under increasing scrutiny following a Washington Post report alleging that Pete Hegseth instructed forces to carry out a deadly strike on boats and explicitly required that everyone on board be killed. According to the report, this order resulted in a suspected second strike on 2 September targeting the damaged hull of a boat to kill two individuals who had survived the initial attack. “I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said, according to Bloomberg . When questioned about whether a follow-up strike would be lawful, he responded, “No, I wouldn’t have wanted that, not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.” Experts say the naval operations have been conducted under questionable legal authority, and they have increasingly unsettled US allies. The administration contends the vessels qualify as valid targets because they are allegedly transporting drugs. Trump said he had no worries about legal objections “because you can see the boats. You can see the drugs in the boats, and each boat is responsible for killing 25,000 Americans.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

FutureLearn Category: Career Development , General , Job Market by FutureLearn Category: Career Development , General , Job Market The world of work is changing, and fast. From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.
