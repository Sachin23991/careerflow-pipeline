{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIndian students and workers accounted for the largest share of visa-holders leaving the United Kingdom this year, according to the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability.

Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that.

So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Siddharth Garg There is a widely believed misconception amongst students and parents, that if a student prepares rigorously for the Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), they will have to give up their preparation for the board exams . There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Ritwij Kumar My fascination with Physics began long before I knew what the Joint Entrance Examination ( JEE ) was. As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIn any typical school, the corridors pulse with a familiar rhythm – footsteps echoing, laughter bouncing off walls, students darting between classrooms with half-zipped bags and hurried greetings. Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band.

The app lets you create digital paintings, sketches, and illustrations using dozens of different types of brushes. Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop. Once you’re finished creating your piece, you can relive your creative journey with the app’s time-lapse “Replay” feature and share a 30-second time-lapse video on social media.

The list will instead focus on somewhat lesser-known apps. Procreate is one of the most popular drawing apps for the iPad, and for good reason. The app lets you create digital paintings, sketches, and illustrations using dozens of different types of brushes. Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop. Once you’re finished creating your piece, you can relive your creative journey with the app’s time-lapse “Replay” feature and share a 30-second time-lapse video on social media. You can access Procreate with a one-time payment of $12.99. LumaFusion is a great app for editing videos if you’re ready to graduate from iMovie. The app features numerous user-friendly features that make it perfect for aspiring videographers or indie filmmakers on a budget. With LumaFusion, you can create multiple layer edits with 4K ProRes and HDR media. You can add different effects, choose from dozens of t"}

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe U.S. immigration system is complex, hard to navigate, and expensive for immigrants. The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms.

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse.

Kensington’s website said the cause of the cyberattack is “now established,” but the council “will not be giving out further details of the incident at this stage” due to an ongoing investigation with U.K. law enforcement agencies.

Baris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, is leaving the company effective December 12, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. CNBC was the first to report the departure. Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google. The departures come several months after GM hired Sterling Anderson to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson’s role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM. Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. The departures are part of a restructuring within GM that’s supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company’s cars, trucks, and SUVs.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIt's a colorful world now with e-paper devices, opening up a sea of color e-reader and digital notebook options like never before. Who wouldn't want a little color splashed on the paperlike screen, giving a feeling of a real page? These color e-readers can do everything a regular e-reader can, but they let you see your book covers and illustrations in their full glory and add colorful highlights to the pages of your latest read. Some even let you write colored notes on the pages or in the digital notebook built within it. It makes for a really fun experience, especially if you're a book-annotator type of person (I aspire to be such a person, but I usually lose steam halfway through a good book) or love graphic novels. I've tried several color e-readers and e-paper devices in my testing , and as I compare overall features and value, I've found myself impressed again and again with the value of Kobo's color e-readers. Whether that's the larger Kobo Libra Colour, our favorite all-around e-reader that can double as a digital notebook, or the affordable Kobo Clara Colour, you can't go wrong with Kobo's colorful devices. From a simple glance, most color e-readers look pretty similar. You'll usually see a 150 pixels-per-inch resolution for color and 300 for black-and-white, which are specs we see for both Kobo’s and Kindle’s color devices. Kobo's two color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and the Kobo Clara Colour, use E Ink Kaleido 3 technology to power their colorful screens. This technology has 16 levels of grayscale and 4,096 colors, allowing it to represent hues from your favorite books with ease.

Who wouldn't want a little color splashed on the paperlike screen, giving a feeling of a real page? These color e-readers can do everything a regular e-reader can, but they let you see your book covers and illustrations in their full glory and add colorful highlights to the pages of your latest read. Some even let you write colored notes on the pages or in the digital notebook built within it. It makes for a really fun experience, especially if you're a book-annotator type of person (I aspire to be such a person, but I usually lose steam halfway through a good book) or love graphic novels. I've tried several color e-readers and e-paper devices in my testing , and as I compare overall features and value, I've found myself impressed again and again with the value of Kobo's color e-readers. Whether that's the larger Kobo Libra Colour, our favorite all-around e-reader that can double as a digital notebook, or the affordable Kobo Clara Colour, you can't go wrong with Kobo's colorful devices. From a simple glance, most color e-readers look pretty similar. You'll usually see a 150 pixels-per-inch resolution for color and 300 for black-and-white, which are specs we see for both Kobo’s and Kindle’s color devices. Kobo's two color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and the Kobo Clara Colour, use E Ink Kaleido 3 technology to power their colorful screens. This technology has 16 levels of grayscale and 4,096 colors, allowing it to represent hues from your favorite books with ease.

Bear Bear The WIRED Reviews team has crowned the Bear Elite Hybrid as the best mattress for back pain we’ve tested to date. It comes in three firmness options, including Soft, Medium, and Firm. WIRED testers have found Firm helpful for spinal alignment, and you can also add a Celliant cover for a fee, designed to help with muscle recovery. In addition to the sale, Bear is also throwing in a free accessories bundle (two pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector ). Use WIRED40 for 40 percent off , which is an additional 5 percent off the current offer on the site.

Changing to a stick vacuum hugely improved my life after moving to a three-story home, but all kinds of vacuum types can turn your life around. Never have time to vacuum or mop? Grab a robot vacuum. Need one for the car or stairs, or just for spot cleaning? You'll want a handheld vacuum. Over lugging your upright vacuum around the house? Trust me, a good stick vacuum is worth investing in.

Eufy Amazon This Eufy robot vacuum is our new top pick in our guide to robot vacuums . While it's the new pick, it's not actually new. This is last season's robot vacuum, and it's at a better price while still packing plenty of features we like to see. Shopping for an older model is WIRED reviewer Adrienne So's advice to get a good robot vacuum without paying four figures. The X10 Pro Omni's mop has downward pressure to actually scrub floors, and it packs a self-emptying bin and a good camera navigation system. 3i Amazon If you're looking for more of a deal, our favorite basic and affordable vacuum is even cheaper than usual right now.

Ninja Amazon Ninja Ninja came out of the gate strong with its first line of semiautomatic, grinder-inclusive espresso machines designed for people who want both ease of use and the rich crema and intense, take-you-for-a-ride taste of actual espresso made with a non-pressurized portafilter. The Luxe Cafe Pro is Ninja's answer to Breville's wildly popular semi-automatic Barista Express ( also on sale for a terrific $500 price for Black Friday ). The Express has the edge on tried-and-tested durability.

A cold foam option is also best-in-class. If you're an espresso purist, I'd roll with Breville. But milk lovers may have reason to choose Ninja. Ninja Amazon Walmart The Premier lacks the Pro model's hot water spout for Americanos, but still offers that bean assist and great milk frothing at a lower price.

It’s the brand’s bread and butter; Cozy Earth's most popular product that put it on the map. It’s not hard to see why, given that these sheets are super breathable with a luxurious, silken feel. They’ve never let me down once as a hot sleeper. Given the higher price, I treat these like they’re made out of gold when I wash and dry them. But take care of them, and they’ll take care of you—I’ve had mine for several years at this point, and they’re trucking along. Cozy Earth Cozy Earth (Tall) Cozy Earth (Regular) Amazon Cozy Earth makes several types of pajamas and loungewear, but my personal tried-and-true is the stretch-knit bamboo pajamas . You can buy tops and bottoms separately, but I prefer to get them both at once to add to my pajama rotation. These PJs blend 95 percent bamboo viscose with 5 percent spandex, resulting in a stretchy, soft, and cool-feeling"}

There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle.

You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ).

Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino?

A small red dot on the right ear cup makes sure they always go on your head the right way, rather than trying to read a little letter on the inside of a band. The physical controls, a clicky wheel and a flicky knob, combine to open up a surprising amount of interaction, which our reviewer Parker Hall called “some of the best and most intuitive controls ever designed.” I spotted the deal on Amazon in both the black and white , and while looks are subjective, I think the white pair look pretty dang sweet. If you're still not sure, pop over to our roundup of the best noise-canceling headphones to help you tune out th"}

Most products remain at retail, but the discounted bundles are worth a look. While we haven't tested CurrentBody's Green Tea Serum and Hydrogel Mask, this Black Friday bundle is a steal because it's cheaper than buying the LED Face Mask Series 2 ($470) on its own. The LED Series 2 is the best red light therapy mask you can buy. CurrentBody CurrentBody The Series 2 is made of medical-grade silicone and packs 236 bulbs, so it contours to your face for close, even coverage.

Barey would go on to flip her TikTok fame into OnlyFans riches. In her first month on the adult platform, she says, she made $8,000. The following month it skyrocketed to $40,000, and eventually she got so popular that she pulled in $300,000 in 30 days. “It was five-and-a-half years of posting on multiple different platforms every single day, multiple times a day,” Barey says. She liked the taste of success. But the demands of the industry also weighed on her, and by 2025, Barey, who felt she and her peers deserved better working conditions, decided to build her own platform. In April, she launched Hidden , the first adult platform owned and operated by sex workers. Billed as the “anti-OnlyFans,” Hidden is out to prove that fairer industry conditions are possible when the people in charge actually come from the world they are profiting on. Hidden is the TikTok version of OnlyFans—a seamlessly, and sleekly, designed creator-friendly platform where, in lieu of Korean skin-care tips and Get Ready With Me videos, you’ll find a ForYou page with videos that features all sorts of adult content: from oral and BDSM to dildo play and lingerie videos. “In this industry, no one expects that anyone's going to be able to change anything. We have to drive all the traffic from our social media to OnlyFans by ourselves. And we're getting more and more burnt out every year, because all of the promotion relies on us.” To fix that, Barey built Hidden around discoverability. “Innovation like adding a ForYou page makes it easier for girls to build up promo.

If you've been thinking of updating, now is the time to buy. The A7R V isn't our top-pick mirrorless camera, but that's mainly because at full price it's expensive relative to the rest of the market. At this price, though, it's a steal, maybe even one of the absolute best Black Friday deals , and while there is no truly best camera for everyone, the A7R V is unquestionably the highest-resolution camera you can buy. And I know, megapixels aren't everything, but I have never taken an image with this camera and thought, darn, that's just too many megapixels. Sony Amazon Adorama B&H Photo The massive 61-megapixel, full-frame sensor in the A7R V is the largest sensor you can get without moving up to a bigger, bulkier medium-format camera. If you want to go totally nuts, get this, landscape photographers: The A7R V can combine 16 shots into a single 240-MP image. It only works with static subjects, but if you ever worried if your images are hi-res enough to cover the side of a building in Times Square, well, you can rest easy with the A7R V.

This is obviously the case onscreen, when pixel peeping, but I also notice the difference when I print images. That the A7R V is $900 off does make you wonder if perhaps the A7R VI is on the horizon? Anything is possible, but I kind of doubt it's coming imminently. The A7C R, which as noted above, is nearly identical in features, is still not on sale.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nEmkay Global Financial's research report on Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail ABFRL’s board has approved the demerger of its Madura business into a new entity – ABLBL, upon the requisite regulatory approvals over the next 9-12 months. In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating. But remaining businesses (Value Retail + Ethnic + D2C + Luxury) will need investments in the near term.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating. But remaining businesses (Value Retail + Ethnic + D2C + Luxury) will need investments in the near term.

We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive. We remain positive on Hatsun due to competitive advantages such as established brands, distribution and direct milk procurement. We marginally raise FY25E and FY26E earnings by 0.4% and 3.3%, respectively. Outlook With 10% stock price correction over past six months and earning tailwinds, we upgrade stock to BUY from HOLD with a DCF-based TP of INR 1,190 (implied P/E of 50x FY26E; earlier TP: INR 1,145).

The joint operation to hit the so-called ‘shadow fleet’ vessels was run by the SBU and Ukraine's navy, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Trump said his decision on social media by posting that “according to many people that I greatly respect,” Hernandez was “treated very harshly and unfairly.” In March 2024, Hernández was convicted in a U.S. court for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States, after serving two terms as president of Honduras, a Central American nation of around 10 million people.

This setback, which appears to be one the biggest recalls affecting Airbus in its 55-year history, comes after a software issue caused a sudden drop in altitude of a JetBlue plane last month, the manufacturer and European aviation safety regulators said on Friday. Airbus said an analysis of the JetBlue incident revealed that intense solar radiation may have corrupted data essential to the aircraft's flight-control systems, leading to the malfunction on the A320, AP reported. No casualties were reported in the JetBlue incident which happened on 30 October, but at least 15 passengers were injured and taken to the hospital after the aircraft experienced the malfunction mid-air. The plane, which was travelling from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, was later diverted to Tampa, Florida. As a result of the disruption, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), an apex body under the European Union has issued an Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD), requiring the operators of Airbus A320 to address the issue on priority. EASA and multiple airlines have already warned the flyers that the repairs could potentially cause flight delays or cancellations, though some carriers maintain that the disruptions are likely to be limited. In Japan, All Nippon Airways, which operates more than 30 planes, canceled 65 domestic flights, scheduled to operate on Saturday.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nA viral Instagram post has triggered a larger conversation around the emotional well-being of men and the burden of being the primary breadwinner in Indian households. The video, shared by creator director-dayal, is titled “Gareeb beta toh maa-baap ko bhi achha nahi lagta” and has struck a chord with thousands online. In the short clip, Dayal narrates an incident just three days after quitting his job and returning to his family home from another city. He recalls how things felt different when he was earning — a time when he felt valued for his contribution. Something as simple as his mother offering him extra rotis at dinner made him feel appreciated, he says. But that warmth, according to him, faded once he was no longer financially supporting the family. Dayal shares that when he recently asked for two extra rotis, his father instructed his mother in a matter-of-fact tone: “He’s asking for two more rotis, give them to him.” The change, he says, left him feeling invisible. Through his emotional monologue, Dayal questions why respect and affection for men are often tied to their income. “If you don’t earn, nobody respects you — not even family,” he says in the video. “Make money… Because if you don’t have it, nothing else matters.\" The video has sparked wide-ranging reactions — from empathy to uncomfortable agreement. Many men admitted that they too have felt love being replaced by judgement during financial setbacks. “This is the reality — a man’s value is measured in how much he provides,” one user wrote. Another quoted comedian Chris Rock’s famous line: “Only women, children and dogs are loved unconditionally. A man is only loved under the condition that he provides something.” Amid the heavy discussion, several viewers offered support and encouragement to the creator. “I’ve started following you from today.
