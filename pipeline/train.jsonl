{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAs CBSE gears up to offer class 10 students the option of giving board exams in select subjects twice from the 2026 exam onwards, CBSE Chairman Rahul Singh said that the Board expects a maximum of around 40% of students to appear in the second board exams in each of the main subjects. “We don’t expect…as a heuristic…we have taken that around 40% children will appear in each of the main subjects, in the second board exam, at max,” Singh said at a webinar on the CBSE two-board exam scheme on Thursday . Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Harshini Rathika Kishore Kumar Singh My interest in studying abroad began when I was in Class 12, when I completed my schooling at Vikaasa World School in Tamil Nadu , an international Cambridge-affiliated school. Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWhen the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ) was founded at Dholpur House in New Delhi in 1958, it marked a turning point in India’s education system – one that bore the imprint of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the country’s first education minister. Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road.

Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n–Karan Mehta Taking mock tests in the upcoming Common Admission Test ( CAT ) is important. But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag.

The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts"}
{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe Delhi government on Friday launched the “School Web App”, a digital platform aimed at modernising the education and administrative processes in its schools to make the education system smarter, more transparent and accessible. It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services. Speaking at the launch, Education Minister Ashish Sood said the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India and Viksit Bharat 2047. The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said. The minister added that the app is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and will encourage skill-based learning while integrating activities under the Fit India initiative. Expressing gratitude to developers, teachers, and administrators involved in the project, Sood said, “When determination is strong, the results are equally powerful.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nUPSC Annual Reports: In a country where women and the third gender make up half the population, their presence in the gateway to India’s top bureaucratic positions remains disproportionately low. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive. UPSC reports from 2010 to 2021 show consistently low participation of women and transgender individuals in the Civil Services Examination, with 2021 being the most recent data available. According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive. UPSC reports from 2010 to 2021 show consistently low participation of women and transgender individuals in the Civil Services Examination, with 2021 being the most recent data available. According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women.

Each winner will receive Rs 31.5 lakh to further develop their innovations. WaterSense, developed by Polish PhD candidate Filip Budny from the Warsaw University of Technology, won in the Sustainability category. The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible. James Dyson, founder of Dyson, said, “The James Dyson Award supports young inventors who think differently and tackle real-world problems head-on. Filip and Alessandra exemplify that spirit, offering practical and ingenious solutions to health and environmental challenges.” This year’s competition — the 20th edition of the global student design award — received over 2,100 entries from 28 countries and regions.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nChatGPT is launching group chats globally to all users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans, OpenAI announced on Thursday. The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allow users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or coworkers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions. The company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options. Up to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. To start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo. It’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged. OpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos. The move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIn a surprising but welcome move, Google has updated Quick Share to work with Apple’s AirDrop, allowing users to more easily transfer files and photos between Android and iPhone devices. The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices. Google plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. The company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses. Quick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share. “This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a blog post . The tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen. Google notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file. The feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged. “We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.” It’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything \n\nAnswer:", "completion": " In a surprising but welcome move, Google has updated Quick Share to work with Apple’s AirDrop, allowing users to more easily transfer files and photos between Android and iPhone devices.

The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. Point One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device. For Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. To achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix.

When it finally saw the year for itself, it was thunderstruck, telling him, “I am suffering from a massive case of temporal shock right now.” Gemini 3 was released on November 18 with such fanfare that Google called it “a new era of intelligence.” And Gemini 3 is, by nearly all accounts (including Karpathy’s), a very capable foundation model, particularly for reasoning tasks. Karpathy is a widely respected AI research scientist who was a founding member of OpenAI, ran AI at Tesla for a while, and is now building a startup, Eureka Labs, to reimagine schools for the AI era with agentic teachers. He publishes a lot of content on what goes on under-the-hood of LLMs . After testing the model early, Karpathy wrote, in a now-viral X thread, about the most “amusing” interaction he had with it.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nFresh off a completely successful second flight of its new mega rocket, Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin has just revealed designs for an even larger version of the launch system. The new-look New Glenn will be even taller than the historic Saturn V rocket and on par with SpaceX’s Starship. This super-heavy version of New Glenn will feature nine of the company’s rocket engines on the booster stage, and four on the upper stage. That’s up from seven and two, respectively, on the current version, which Blue Origin says will continue to fly alongside the super-heavy variant. Blue Origin is now referring to the two versions as New Glenn 9×4 and New Glenn 7×2. That added firepower will increase the New Glenn booster’s total thrust and allow it to carry “over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit,” slightly below Starship’s current theoretical capacity of 100 metric tons. SpaceX is working on new versions of Starship that could double that figure. The larger New Glenn will feature a much larger fairing (the forward-facing shield that covers the rocket’s payload) to allow bigger payloads at the top of the rocket. The added capability will put Blue Origin in play for missions centered around “mega-constellations, lunar and deep space explorations, and national security imperatives such as Golden Dome.” Blue Origin is currently competing with SpaceX to help with NASA missions to the moon, and the company is clearly teasing this capability in the rendering it released of New Glenn 9×4 on Thursday. The illustration shows a theoretical view from the ground looking up at the new super-heavy rocket shortly after takeoff. Above the rocket, appearing larger-than-usual? The moon.

Google announced the move Thursday, noting that Gemini will start to roll out to Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phone. By bringing Gemini to Android Auto, Google is making it possible for users to speak naturally and have a back-and-forth conversation to complete more complex tasks on the go, according to the company. Android Auto is an app that runs on a user’s phone and wirelessly communicates and projects features like navigation, music, and messaging from an Android-based smartphone to the car’s display. The rollout doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. The company announced in May that Gemini would be coming to Android Auto this year. With Gemini, users can ask questions about businesses along their route to find something specific. For example, users could ask something like: “Hey, Google, I need your help. I’m suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?” If a spot looks interesting, Gemini can offer more information about the place, such as details about the restaurant’s most popular dish or whether the establishment is dog-friendly. Users can also reply to messages with Gemini and get summaries of texts. For instance, you can ask Gemini to let your friend know that you’re stuck in traffic and to add your ETA to the message. Or, you can ask Gemini to translate a message into a different language before sending it. Gemini also lets users access their emails in Gmail while driving.

The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts, and languages. The model also has web-searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards.

The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image.

One of the biggest complaints against cats is that litter boxes are stinky, and you don’t want another creature’s poop just hanging out in your house. Naysayers be gone! Because thanks to ever-evolving and growing pet tech, automatic cat litter boxes have provided a hygienic, low-labor solution to the smelly litter box problem.

Our new favorite automatic litter box is the Purobot Max Pro 2 because of its compact design and camera to monitor.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen.

The best protein powders are an easy boost to any of your go-to recipes, from smoothies to muffins to morning waffles. I rely on it to fill in the nutritional gaps when my meals aren’t winning any wellness awards. While the recommended daily allowance for protein is just 0.36 grams per pound of body weight , that’s the minimum to avoid deficiency, not the sweet spot for optimal health. Depending on how active you are or your dietary needs, your daily protein recommendation may increase. For more on this, check out How Much Protein Do I Need? What was once the territory of gym bros trying to bulk up has exploded into the mainstream. Protein powders are on every shelf, in every form and flavor, and for every dietary preference. Whether you’re plant-based , a picky eater, or need a quick nutrient boost, protein powder is your fast pass.

For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves.

But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute. I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws.

There’s the centralization of Google Docs , Drive, and Gmail, of course, but Google has bolstered its productivity suite with an AI infusion via Gemini, as well as simplified its offerings to work for massive corporations all the way down to individual users . If you want to get the best price, you need a Google Workspace promo code. Thankfully, you’ve landed in the right spot. Google is offering Workspace discounts until the end of 2025, allowing you to save up to 14 percent on a plan for your first three months. You just need to use one of the coupon codes linked above. Google Workspace works for both individual users and businesses, but if you’re just looking for more Drive space and a few extra features, take a look at Google One . Now through the beginning of 2026 (January 1), Google is offering a discount on all of its Workspace plans, including Starter, Standard, and Plus. Regardless of which plan you choose, or when you sign up, you’ll get a discount on your first three months of service as long as your plan starts before January 1, 2026. There are some notable differences between each Workspace plan – I’ll dig into them in the next section – but all three plans come with access to the full slate of Workspace apps.

A draft of the order viewed by WIRED directs US attorney general Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force,” whose purpose is to sue states in court for passing AI regulations that allegedly violate federal laws governing things like free speech and interstate commerce. Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation.

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said.

The hire is a key part of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis’ vision for Gemini to become a sort of robot operating system, similar to how Google supplies its Android software to an array of smartphone manufacturers. “You can sort of think of it as a bit like an Android play [...] We want to build an AI system, a Gemini base, that can work almost out-of-the-box, across any body configuration,” Hassabis said in an interview with WIRED. “Obviously humanoids, but nonhumanoids too.” Boston Dynamics is famous for developing legged robots, including four-legged dog-sized systems and humanoid machines capable of impressive acrobatic feats. Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems.

That's great advice, but of course Black Friday is also one of the biggest retail spending days of the year, and REI is a for-profit co-op—what to do? Have your holiday sale early, of course. This year the REI Holiday Sale runs from November 14 to 24. There are two member-exclusive coupons with the Holiday Sale. The first is for 20 percent off a regular-priced item at REI, the second is 20 percent off any item at REI Outlet. Many of the best REI deals this year are on the company's house brand gear, but we've also pulled in deals from competing sales at Backcountry, Six Moon Designs, Zenbivy, and other cottage industry retailers. Below are the best deals on all our favorite tents, backpacks, sleeping bags, pads, cookware, outdoor apparel, and more. Not sure what you need? Check out our many outdoor gear guides , including guides to the best backpacking tents , best sleeping bags , best sleeping pads for backpacking , best base layers , best merino wool clothes , best rain jackets and many more for all our well-tested picks.

Users sometimes experience mental breakdowns during lengthy conversations with chatbots or confide in them about their suicidal ideations . “We need to have really big conversations across society about what role we want AI to play in our future as humans who are interacting with each other,” says Ryn Linthicum, head of user well-being policy at Anthropic . At the event‚ organized by Anthropic and Stanford, industry folk intermingled with academics and other experts, splitting into small groups to talk about nascent AI research and brainstorming deployment guidelines for chatbot companions. Anthropic says less than one percent of its Claude chatbot’s interactions are roleplay scenarios initiated by users; it’s not what the tool was designed for.

Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nMemo may not be the world’s fastest barista, but it is impressive—for a robot. I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again.

This initiative is called “FIFA Pass.” “FIFA Pass is a prioritized appointment scheduling system,” Infantino said from the Oval Office. “So if you have a ticket for the World Cup, you can have a prioritized appointment to get your visa. Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States.

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nJamie would meticulously schedule his days around finding time alone to watch porn and masturbate—often up to five times a day. The 32-year-old Michigan engineer, who did not want to use his real name due to privacy concerns, first watched porn at the impressionable age of 12, but never realized he had a problem until just after his father’s funeral three years ago. “I didn't shed a single tear,” he says. “I didn't know how to react happily or sadly to anything.” That’s when his porn consumption spiraled—combined with stress, anxiety, and depression—and he locked himself in his room “all day.” The only thing that seemed palpable, he recalls, “was that rush of dopamine” delivered by an intense session of hardcore porn viewing. But for Jamie, who is Christian, those fleeting moments of porn-fueled transcendance were followed by far deeper lows, including suicidal ideations. This past March, Jamie says his partner angrily confronted him over his compulsive porn consumption, accusing him of lying and committing adultery. Jamie’s “entire world came down.” He admitted he felt that he was addicted, begged for her forgiveness, temporarily moved back in with his mother, and renounced porn. That’s when he found Relay , an app created by a pair of Mormon college students that claims it can help people “take back control from porn, one day at a time.” Jamie promised his partner he would never watch porn again—and she gave him one chance. The app provides a comprehensive plan to stop watching porn, with videos by therapists, daily journal prompts, live group sharing sessions, and a function to address serious urges. Users even keep track of each other’s porn-free streaks, with a “Live Milestone” ticker. This is all in an effort to help customers, who pay $149 per year for full access, unpack their underlying issues like loneliness and trauma to help prevent relapse. The app has been downloaded over 110,000 times, with company data showing that 89 percent of its users are male.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nMemes are getting a reboot. Not like a Marvel -is-trying-to-make- Fantastic Four -happen-again reboot. More like a rewind. The Great Meme Reset of 2026, as it’s being called on TikTok , demands that on January 1 all memes revert to their 2010s glory days. Bland “ brain rot ” and AI -looking memes are out; Big Chungus is in. As with anything on the internet, the origin of the Great Meme Reset is hard to place. Most sources point to a March post from TikTok user @joebro909 that called for a whole new generation of memes to save the platform from the “ drought ” that had engulfed it in the spring. The post said nothing of a January 1 launch date, or a return to the memes of the last decade, but the idea was planted. Now hundreds of posts are discussing the reboot—and a return to the internet’s “dank” era. Which implies, of course, that memes lack dankness these days. If anything, Gen Z– and Gen Alpha–fueled internet culture has prided itself on somewhat meaningless content like “ 6 7 ” and absurdist, seemingly AI-generated “ Italian brain rots ,” but after nearly a year of memes with little humanity or depth, a backlash has begun. “Because of just how unrecognizable memes have become,” TikTok creator Noah Glenn Carter ( @noahglenncarter ) said in a recent video, “everyone has come to an agreement that on January 1, 2026, we are going to completely reset all memes and go back to the originals.” When I reach Carter via email, the creator seems pretty convinced the reset idea could take off, and he plans to make more videos promoting it. “The memes we have now are called ‘brain rot’ for a reason,” Carter says. “The ones 10+ [years older], most of the time, had a story behind them. Or they at least made sense. Now it just seems like the more random and incoherent something is the more likely it is to become a meme.” Even if you’re in the camp that understands memes like “6 7” have more significance than they’re given credit for, there’s still a sense amongst the Great Rese\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " Memes are getting a reboot.

It also removed one: Launchpad. The feature, which gave Mac users an iPhone-like grid of applications complete with support for folders, is missing from macOS 26. Now, to be fair, a lot of people didn't really use Launchpad. Many people keep their most-used applications on their dock and turn to Spotlight, or other launchers like macOS's new Apps window, to quickly access the rest.

Launchie is free, available in the Mac App Store, and as of this writing doesn't have any kind of in-app purchases. It's the best Launchpad replacement I could find. Open the application and you'll see all of your apps listed in alphabetical order. You can use your arrow keys to choose an application, if you want, or you can scroll with your mouse. Launchie is a free download. It's not a perfect Launchpad replacement in one way: It's an ongoing scrolling list of applications, not a set of individual panels.

You can create folders within your launch grid. There are a few settings you can tweak, such as whether the launcher should take over the full screen or open in a window. You can also configure the appearance, decide whether the app should open when your Mac does, and set a keyboard shortcut for opening the launcher. Customize the look.

Her sadness got harder to carry after her uncle died, and she felt she couldn’t turn to her grieving parents for comfort. Bumming fruity vapes at school became part of her routine. “I would ask my friends who had them, ‘I’m going through a lot, can I use it?’” Gutierrez, now 18, told The 74. “Or ‘I failed my test and I feel like smoking would be better than cutting my wrists.’” It worked until she got caught. Like students across the country, Gutierrez got dragged into a nicotine-fueled war between vape manufacturers—including a company that leveraged online advertisements on the websites of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to hook kids on e-cigarettes —and educators, who’ve turned to digital surveillance tools and discipline to crack down on the youngest users. Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY.

Amid the challenging macros, the management aims for top-quartile growth in FY25E, while maintaining EBITM at FY24 levels. Company reiterated their medium-term target of improving EBITM by 200-300bps over the next 3 years. Outlook However, progress has been slow and target is shifted by a year; which is disappointing. Moderation in deal intake, Q4 performance, and slow progress on margin trajectory led to EPS cut of 5-6% for FY25-26E. Valuation remains rich even after today’s ~10% price correction. We retain REDUCE with a TP of Rs3,700/sh at 34x Mar-25E EPS.

The visit comes soon after UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s trade mission to India and is aimed at strengthening business links, boosting investment flows and expanding collaboration in technology, education and skills. Trade between the two countries continues to grow steadily. India’s merchandise exports to the UK rose 11.7% to $14.5 billion in FY25, while imports grew 2.3% to $8.6 billion, taking the total trade to $23.1 billion, up 8% from $21.39 billion in FY24, when exports were at $12.98 billion and imports at $8.4 billion. The landmark India-UK FTA was signed on 24 July in London during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit. It is the most comprehensive FTA signed by the UK in the Indo-Pacific region post-Brexit and adds to India’s growing portfolio of bilateral trade agreements, including those with Australia and the UAE.

Severe child deprivation has decreased by one-third since 2000, marking a significant milestone in global development, the UN children's agency said in its report The State of the World's Children 2025. “So far this century, countries have made progress towards reducing child poverty as measured by severe deprivation. Estimates show that poverty based on severe deprivation in at least one area has fallen by one third since 2000 in low- and middle-income countries,” the report said.

In India, as many as 206 million children experience at least one deprivation, but fewer than one-third, or 62 million, experience two or more, according to the report.

According to European think tank, India spent as much as 2.5 billion euro on purchases of crude oil from Moscow in October, and it was unchanged from the 2.5 billion euro spent on buying Russian oil in September. In its monthly tracking report, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) stated that India remained the second-largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels in October behind China. \"India remained the second-largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels, importing a total of EUR 3.1 billion. Crude oil dominated India's purchases at 81 per cent (EUR 2.5 billion), followed by coal at 11 per cent (EUR 351 million) and oil products at 7 per cent (EUR 222 million),\" CREA said. In October, US President Donald Trump had reiterated his claim that Delhi will significantly reduce its energy purchases from Moscow. Trump has been claiming that Delhi has assured him that it will significantly reduce its oil imports from Russia. Howev"}

In a notification on Thursday, Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the US State Department has approved the sale of $93 million worth of military equipment. This is the first time New Delhi has purchased defence equipment from Washington after US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50% as punishment for the country's purchases of Russian oil. According to the DSCA statement, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions. The agency added that the “proposed sale will improve India's capability to meet current and future threats by providing precision capability equipment, which will increase first strike accuracy in its brigades. India will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” The Javelin missile system is a modern anti-tank guided missile system that is used extensively across the world. It is a single man-portable fire-and-forget medium-range anti-tank weapon system designed to defeat all known and projected threat armour.

Deputy Chief Minister Surinder Choudhary asked the investigative agencies not to \"pick-and-choose\" media organisations for raids, saying there should not be any pressure on the press. \"The agencies are doing their work. If a raid has to be conducted, it should not be done on a pick-and-choose basis. If they have done anything wrong, action should be taken, but not just to create pressure. The Press is the fourth estate, and it should get space to practise journalism,\" Surinder Choudhary told reporters. The Kashmir Times management sharply criticised the reported raids on its Jammu office, terming the allegations of activities inimical to the state a coordinated attempt to suppress an independent media institution. The editors said Kashmir Times, founded in 1954 by Ved Bhasin, has consistently upheld independent journalism. “We have chronicled the region’s triumphs and failures with equal rigour. We have given voice to communities that would otherwise go unheard. We have asked difficult questions when others remained silent,” they said.

The latest clashes, which left at least 10 people injured, have reignited concerns over the deepening political rift between young protesters and the opposition party’s leadership. Tension flared on Thursday in Simara Chowk after Gen-Z demonstrators returned to the streets, alleging that police had failed to arrest individuals named in their complaint from the previous day’s clashes. According to The Kathmandu Post , crowds began assembling from 11 AM, well before the Bara district administration announced a curfew from 1 PM to 8 PM to prevent further escalation. However, the prohibitory order quickly unravelled. As Khabarhub reported, “However, the prohibitory order failed to take effect, with demonstrators pouring into the streets and clashing with police. Authorities fired six tear gas canisters and two rounds of aerial fire after protesters defied the curfew and continued advancing.” Protesters hurled stones at security forces, injuring six police personnel, while four Gen-Z activists were also reported injured, the news outlet added. The confrontation stems from anger over the perceived mishandling of earlier complaints and simmering hostility between Gen-Z activists and CPN-UML members. The initial clashes erupted on Wednesday when news spread that CPN-UML general secretary Shankar Pokharel and youth leader Mahesh Basnet were flying from Kathmandu to Simara to address an anti-government rally. Gen-Z protesters rushed to the airport to oppose their arrival, leading to a violent confrontation with UML cadres.
