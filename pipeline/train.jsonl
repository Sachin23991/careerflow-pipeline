The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag.

It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services. Speaking at the launch, Education Minister Ashish Sood said the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s vision of Digital India and Viksit Bharat 2047. The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said. The minister added that the app is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and will encourage skill-based learning while integrating activities under the Fit India initiative.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit.

Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive.

In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam.

Each winner will receive Rs 31.5 lakh to further develop their innovations. WaterSense, developed by Polish PhD candidate Filip Budny from the Warsaw University of Technology, won in the Sustainability category. The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible. James Dyson, founder of Dyson, said, “The James Dyson Award supports young inventors who think differently and tackle real-world problems head-on. Filip and Alessandra exemplify that spirit, offering practical and ingenious solutions to health and environmental challenges.” This year’s competition — the 20th edition of the global student design award — received over 2,100 entries from 28 countries and regions.

I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results.

India’s startup ecosystem — the world’s third-largest — is expected to play a pivotal role in achieving the nation’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision and $5 trillion economy target, a statement released by IIT Madras noted, adding that yet, a major challenge remains the “information conundrum,” where data appears abundant but is fragmented and scattered, making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions. Addressing this issue, IIT Madras CREST and YNOS have developed India’s only independent digital platform dedicated to startups. The platform already hosts over 2.75 lakh startups, 15,000 angel investors, 5,500 venture capital firms, 1,400 incubators, 800 banks, and 110 government support schemes, making it the country’s largest and most comprehensive startup database. Explaining the objective, Prof Thillai Rajan A, head of CREST and faculty member at the Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras, said: “Information asymmetry has long been one of the biggest barriers for founders. Through the ‘Startups for All’ initiative, we aim to level the playing field by giving every entrepreneur and citizen — irrespective of location or background — equal access to credible information that supports smarter decisions and faster growth. The platform offers free initial access with complimentary credits for registered users"}

According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations.

Indians spent $50.25 million on education in Georgia in 2024-25, a nearly five-fold surge from $10.33 million in 2018-19, according to data on Reserve Bank of India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), obtained under the RTI Act. This rise, the LRS data shows, has come largely at Ukraine’s expense, with Indian remittances for education there dropping from $14.80 million in 2018-19 to just $2.40 million in 2024-25. In the years before the war, Indian remittances for education in Ukraine were rising. In fact, Ukraine was among the top 10 destinations for Indian students in 2020-21 and 2021-22, when remittances touched $39.12 million. This fell sharply to about $10.6 million in 2022-23, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The same year, 2022-23, Georgia entered the list of top 15 countries to which Indians sent money for education abroad — ranking 14th, a significant jump from its 21st position in 2018-19. The country has since moved up to the 12th place. According to data submitted in Parliament in December last year on the number of Indians who disclosed their purpose as ‘study/education’ while going abroad, there were 4,148 such Indians who went to Georgia in 2019. This number rose to 10,470 in 2023. According to Foreign education consultants, Georgia was already popular for medical and paramedical courses such as physiotherapy, but it gained substantially after the war began as students avoided Ukraine and those already enrolled in medical courses there sought transfers to universities in Georgia.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAmazon’s budding satellite internet program is no longer called Project Kuiper. It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts. The satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network’s location in what’s known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.” As Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren’t well-served by traditional internet providers. But, as TechCrunch previously noted , the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX’s Starlink service.

It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts. The satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network’s location in what’s known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.” As Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren’t well-served by traditional internet providers. But, as TechCrunch previously noted , the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX’s Starlink service.

And now after years of testing and development, the company’s commercial robotaxi service is using freeways around the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. This is a critical expansion for the company. It’s the concrete and asphalt connective tissue in sprawling metro areas like the Bay Area. This new freeway access is fueling Waymo’s expansion in that region, which is now 260 square miles and encompasses Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Robotaxi rides can have more efficient routes too. Waymo told me it will reduce ride times by up to 50%. And using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in.

Reuters reports the jury found that the Apple Watch’s workout mode and heart rate notification features violated Masimo’s patent. “This is a significant win in our ongoing efforts to protect our innovations and intellectual property, which is crucial to our ability to develop technology that benefits patients,” Masimo said in a statement . “We remain committed to defending our IP rights moving forward.” An Apple spokesperson said in a statement that the verdict is “contrary to the facts” and that Apple plans to appeal. “Masimo is a medical device company that does not sell any products to consumers,” the spokesperson said. “Over the past six years they have sued Apple in multiple courts and asserted over 25 patents, the majority of which have been found to be invalid. The single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago.” The legal dispute between Masimo and Apple focuses on pulse oximetry, which uses an optical sensor to detect blood flow. Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees — including its chief medical officer — and infringing its patents on pulse oximetry technology.

Leaked documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron provide more of a glimpse into OpenAI’s financials — specifically its revenue and compute costs over the past couple of years. Zitron reported this week that in 2024, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI. In the first three quarters of 2025, that number jumped to $865.8 million, according to documents he viewed. OpenAI reportedly shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft as part of a previous deal where the software giant invested over $13 billion in the powerful AI startup. (Neither the startup nor the people in Redmond have publicly confirmed this percentage.) However, this is where things get a little sticky, because Microsoft also shares revenue with OpenAI, kicking back about 20% of the revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Bing is powered by OpenAI, and the OpenAI Service sells cloud access to OpenAI’s models to developers and businesses. The source also told TechCrunch that the leaked payments refer to Microsoft’s net revenue share, not the gross revenue share.

I’ve tested the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic for the past three weeks, and here’s what I’ve found. Before diving into the specifics, it’s worth noting that since the software behind the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is the same as the Oura Ring 4, I won’t be delving too deeply into the software and hardware side of things. For that, you can check out our Oura Ring 4 review . The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic comes in four colors: Midnight (dark blue), Cloud (white), Tide (light teal), and Petal (light pink). The ring costs $150 more than the starting price of the standard Ring 4, with a $500 price tag, and is available in sizes 4-15. I opted for Midnight. Although the shade is technically dark blue, it can appear black from afar — or even a dark shade of green, I’ve been told. The ring doesn’t look like a tech wearable at first glance, which is nice if you want to prioritize aesthetics without sacrificing functionality. When compared to the original Ring 4, the Ceramic version slightly thicker, but the difference is hardly noticeable. The titanium version is 2.88 mm thick, while the ceramic version measures 3.51 mm. As for the weight, the ring can weigh between 5.1 and 8.1 grams, depending on the size you get, making it heavier than the Titanium Ring 4, which weighs between 3.3 and 5.2 grams. Despite the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic being thicker and heavier than its predecessor, I found it to be comfortable and lightweight, even when compared to a standard metal band\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " Let’s be honest, most tech wearables are bulky and not exactly what you’d describe as pretty.

The telltale sign that supposedly signals text written by AI has popped up everywhere in recent months, including in school papers, emails, comments, customer service chats, LinkedIn posts, online forums, ad copy, and more. The inclusion of the em dash has led people to criticize those writers for being lazy and turning to an AI chatbot to do their work. Of course, many have also argued for the em dash, saying it’s been a part of their writing well before LLMs adopted the punctuation. However, the fact that chatbots couldn’t seem to avoid its use made the so-called “ChatGPT hyphen” a newly objectionable addition to any text, even if they weren’t a reliable signal of content created by generative AI. The problem had stumped OpenAI for some time, as ChatGPT users were unable to get the chatbot to stop using the symbol, even when they specifically asked it not to. Now, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company has fixed the problem. In a post on X , Altman writes, “If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it’s supposed to do,” calling the update a “small-but-happy win.” Small-but-happy win: If you tell ChatGPT not to use em-dashes in your custom instructions, it finally does what it's supposed to do! The company explains in a post on Threads (where it forced ChatGPT to apologize for “ruining the em dash”) that ChatGPT will be better at not using the em dash if you instruct it not to via the custom instructions in your personalization settings.

Faceless, shrouded in black with red eyes and a top hat, it ominously lurks in the corner. The Benadryl Hat Man is a shared and recurring hallucination that people report witnessing when taking dozens of the antihistamine at a time. The figure, depicted in Halloween costumes , POV-Benadryl trip memes , and Walmart graphic tees , has become the symbol for a new drug trend that sees young people deliberately taking large doses of the drug, not to ward off allergies, but to get high. John, a 21-year-old college student who used to trip on Benadryl, never saw the Hat Man. Yet, he says, “I could see how that could happen. It's [Benadryl] digging in the depths of your brain to find whatever's making you scared. So, if you're scared of the Hat Man, I'm sure you're going to see the Hat Man.” This searching for the unpleasant to reveal itself, while sounding horrible, is, in fact, the purpose of recreational Benadryl use. (John does not want his real name used due to fear of friends finding out.) When used in high doses, diphenhydramine, an ingredient in Benadryl, functions as a deliriant, a hallucinogenic class of drugs, which appear to be becoming increasingly popular among young people for nonmedical purposes. Unlike psychedelics or other hallucinogens, there’s no real potential for a good trip on a deliriant. According to the people I spoke to, every trip is bad, every trip is brutal, and that’s the point.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAs Kent Halliburton stood in a bathroom at the Rosewood Hotel in central Amsterdam, thousands of miles from home, running his fingers through an envelope filled with €10,000 in crisp banknotes, he started to wonder what he had gotten himself into. Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family.

Marshall’s consumer arm (once a separate entity) became a success by leveraging the amplifier brand’s musical legacy for an expansive line of headphones and Bluetooth speakers that sound nearly as powerful, raucous, and downright fun as they look. Moving into soundbars might seem like a natural succession, but creating an all-in-one distributor of surround sound and spatial audio formats that sits neatly beneath your TV is not without its challenges. The Heston 120 is a beautiful reflection of Marshall’s design heritage, and there’s a lot this 5.1.2-channel system gets right, but it’s a surprisingly mercurial performer. It's capable of a premium touch and immersive overhead and side-firing effects. But when it comes to cinematic punch in action scenes and impactful moments, something is holding it back. In other words, this soundbar just doesn’t rock. It’s nearly impossible not to admire the Heston 120’s style. My wife—who has endured more soundbar unboxings than any audio civilian should have to—was immediately impressed by its striking design. Tactile touches like long strips of vinyl, coarse amplifier threading on the grille, and gleaming gold control knobs provide an impressive home theater translation of Marshall's original amplifiers, as well as speakers like the Stanmore and Kilburn .

Digital photography is well into its third decade. Yet film keeps hanging on, lying there shouting, “It's just a flesh wound!” I'd argue that film photography will never die. In the postapocalyptic future, long after the grid has collapsed and all our digital images are gone, someone will pop up with a Nikon FM2T and carry on documenting the world with expired Tri-X. If you want to shoot film, fear not. It's easier than ever to shoot, develop, and print film. We've put together this guide to help you learn, or re-learn, the joys of film photography, whether you're a newcomer or an expert, but haven't shot film in a few years. Updated November 2025: By reader request I've added a new section with some tips for manually focusing, and another recommended development service, Memphis Film Lab. I've also updated film prices and link throughout. Regrettably, film keeps getting more expensive. If you want to get started with analog photography, you'll need a film camera. This could be an entire guide on its own, but in the interest of simplicity, I'll suggest a couple of capable, reasonably priced 35-mm film cameras suitable for first time analog photographers. There are hundreds of other film cameras out there to choose from, ranging from brand-new offerings by manufacturers like Lomography , to venerable Leicas that still sell for many thousands of dollars without a lens (which will set you back several more thousands of dollars). If you're new to buying used camera gear on eBay, have a look at our guide to buying used on eBay to stay safe and get the best bang for your buck. There are also medium- and large-format cameras, often for very cheap (also often not, as the Hasselblad 501cm continues to sell for many thousands).

In the postapocalyptic future, long after the grid has collapsed and all our digital images are gone, someone will pop up with a Nikon FM2T and carry on documenting the world with expired Tri-X. If you want to shoot film, fear not. It's easier than ever to shoot, develop, and print film. We've put together this guide to help you learn, or re-learn, the joys of film photography, whether you're a newcomer or an expert, but haven't shot film in a few years. Updated November 2025: By reader request I've added a new section with some tips for manually focusing, and another recommended development service, Memphis Film Lab. I've also updated film prices and link throughout. Regrettably, film keeps getting more expensive. If you want to get started with analog photography, you'll need a film camera. This could be an entire guide on its own, but in the interest of simplicity, I'll suggest a couple of capable, reasonably priced 35-mm film cameras suitable for first time analog photographers. There are hundreds of other film cameras out there to choose from, ranging from brand-new offerings by manufacturers like Lomography , to venerable Leicas that still sell for many thousands of dollars without a lens (which will set you back several more thousands of dollars). If you're new to buying used camera gear on eBay, have a look at our guide to buying used on eBay to stay safe and get the best bang for your buck. There are also medium- and large-format cameras, often for very cheap (also often not, as the Hasselblad 501cm continues to sell for many thousands). Future updates to this guide will include more options for these larger formats, but for now, I've kept it simple with 35-mm cameras. Once you've got the"}

In 2020, I fell for disinformation. I heard somewhere that the aluminum in my deodorant was going to give me all sorts of ailments. And it seemed credible enough that I made the switch from my trusty antiperspirant to “natural” deodorant—which is still my tried-and-true pick, Native Deodorant . Turns out, aluminum in antiperspirant isn’t really harmful . And it’s important to note that “natural” is a term that’s not regulated or defined by the Food and Drug Administration. Marketing language using the terms “natural” or “nontoxic” doesn’t necessarily mean that a product is healthy, or better or worse than another product. For purposes of this guide, “natural” means “aluminum-free.” Aluminum-free deodorant prevents odor. It doesn’t prevent you from sweating the way antiperspirant does, but it usually has some sort of agent to absorb some sweat. Antiperspirants with aluminum actively prevent you from sweating in the first place, and they’ve got fragrance to help mask any odor that escapes. I like using natural deodorant much more than traditional antiperspirants. I feel better when I sweat, I like that the ingredients don’t harsh out my sometimes-sensitive skin, and I like that I can pronounce (and usually identify) the ingredients. I promise I smell good! (I actually think I smell better than I did when I used antiperspirant, for what that’s worth.) As explained further below, aluminum is safe for most people to use. Ultimately, it comes down to whether you want to sweat a little or prevent it entirely. Both types of deodorant work to keep you smelling good and feeling fresh—they just do it in different ways.

The Aedes aegypti is a species of mosquito that people like Tim Moore, district manager of a mosquito control district on the Western Slope of Colorado, really don’t want to see. “Boy, they are locked into humans,” Moore said. “That’s their blood meal.” This mosquito species is native to tropical and subtropical climates, but as climate change pushes up temperatures and warps precipitation patterns, the Aedes aegypti—which can spread Zika, dengue, chikungunya and other potentially deadly viruses—is on the move. It’s popping up all over the Mountain West, where conditions have historically been far too harsh for it to survive. In the last decade, towns in New Mexico and Utah have begun catching Aedes aegypti in their traps year after year, and just this summer, one was found for the first time in Idaho .

The company, most famous for its PC gaming platform, Steam, announced a new home console called Steam Machine alongside a new version of the Steam Controller , and a new virtual reality headset dubbed the Steam Frame . The Steam Machine is a revival of Valve’s original Steam Machine , a failed attempt to bring PC gaming to the living room almost exactly 10 years ago . Now, it’s back, built on the success of the Steam Deck handheld. Valve claims the new Steam Machine is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and it's kind of like a compact PC. We don’t have exact measurements yet, but some early hands-on impressions have called it similar in size to the Nintendo GameCube. The Steam Machine uses a custom Zen 4 CPU from AMD, and will reportedly be sold in several memory and storage configurations, which are user-upgradable. The new Steam Controller is meant to be paired with the Steam Machine, and it has two haptic-feedback trackpads and the typical assortment of thumbsticks, buttons, triggers, and bumpers. Lastly, there’s the Steam Frame . This long-awaited VR headset is the follow-up to the Valve Index , which is over six years old. Valve calls the Steam Frame a “streaming-first” VR headset, meant to be connected to a PC for lag-free, wireless gaming. To overcome the problem of latency, the Steam Frame will come with a dedicated wireless module to connect to your PC to ensure all the visual data is transferred as smoothly as possible. The Steam Frame can also be used as a stand-alone headset, running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, meaning you’d be playing x86 games on ARM in SteamOS. It’s a tricky endeavor, but based on the success of the Steam Deck in juggling the emulation layers required, I trust Valve to do it in a way Microsoft has always struggled with.

Two US warrants and affidavits seen by WIRED detail how Starlink devices are allegedly being used by cybercriminals running scam compounds in Myanmar. One warrant, issued on Wednesday by US magistrate judge G. Michael Harvey, authorized the seizure of nine Starlink terminals and two Starlink accounts allegedly used in scam compounds in Payathonzu, near Three Pagodas Pass at the Myanmar-Thai border. A linked affidavit, written by FBI investigators, claims that the Starlink devices and accounts played a “substantial role” in an alleged money laundering and wire fraud operation targeting US citizens—saying Starlink parent company SpaceX should “disable service” to the devices. It also claims that at least 26 Starlink dishes appeared to be on the roofs of several buildings making up one scam center of several in the Three Pagodas Pass area. The second warrant and affidavit—which was not issued to Starlink but focused on seizing websites used in scamming—also claims that “at least” 79 Starlink dishes appear on the roofs of buildings at the notorious Tai Chang compound in Myanmar, which US officials say is controlled by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, an armed group in Myanmar that was sanctioned by the US government this week.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani urged people on Thursday to boycott Starbucks as unionized baristas at dozens of its US locations went on strike.

Now, a US-wide trial will test whether tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, may be an effective treatment for people with long Covid . Part of a class of drugs known as GLP-1s , tirzepatide acts on receptors in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite. As a result, people shed pounds by eating less. But decreased body weight doesn’t fully explain the positive effects on the heart and kidney. Mounting evidence suggests that the drugs have a broad anti-inflammatory effect on the body—a mechanism that’s of interest for treating long Covid. As many as 20 million people in the US have experienced long Covid, a chronic condition that lasts for at least three months after an initial infection. While more than 200 symptoms of long Covid have been documented, some of the most common include coughing, shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, mood changes, trouble sleeping, and body aches. Scientists still don’t fully understand how and why long Covid occurs, but they’ve found persistent inflammation in many patients. This chronic inflammation may be caused by lingering traces of virus in the body or by misdirected antibodies, known as autoantibodies, that attack a person’s own cells and tissues. The hope is that tirzepatide could tamp down this inflammation to improve patients’ symptoms. “The rationale for a GLP-1 drug is its powerful body-wide and brain anti-inflammatory properties,” says Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the director of the La Jolla, California-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which is sponsoring the trial.

On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee released 20,000 documents from Epstein’s estate, a number of which directly reference president Donald Trump. The cache of documents contain messages from Epstein, where the sex offender says he knows “ how dirty Donald is, ” and that the president had spent hours in Epstein’s own home with one of his victims. In one message from Epstein to author Michael Wolff, Epstein writes: “ Of course he knew about the girls .” The White House has dismissed the revelations as nothing but a partisan attempt to smear Trump, a narrative MAGA world has been more than happy to get behind, even though the same people spent years calling for further investigations into Epstein’s associates. In February, the White House gave a dozen right-wing influencers including conservative commentator Liz Wheeler and Chaya Raichik, the woman who runs the notorious LibsofTikTok account , access to a number of Epstein-related documents. They walked out of the White House waving white binders labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “The Most Transparent Administration in History,” though the administration later admitted many of the documents were already in the public domain. But this week, following the drop of new documentation, the influencers have been silent.

The cache of documents contain messages from Epstein, where the sex offender says he knows “ how dirty Donald is, ” and that the president had spent hours in Epstein’s own home with one of his victims. In one message from Epstein to author Michael Wolff, Epstein writes: “ Of course he knew about the girls .” The White House has dismissed the revelations as nothing but a partisan attempt to smear Trump, a narrative MAGA world has been more than happy to get behind, even though the same people spent years calling for further investigations into Epstein’s associates. In February, the White House gave a dozen right-wing influencers including conservative commentator Liz Wheeler and Chaya Raichik, the woman who runs the notorious LibsofTikTok account , access to a number of Epstein-related documents. They walked out of the White House waving white binders labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “The Most Transparent Administration in History,” though the administration later admitted many of the documents were already in the public domain. But this week, following the drop of new documentation, the influencers have been silent.

Well, NASA scientists say the construction of China’s Three Gorges Dam actually did make the days longer, by slowing the rotation of the Earth. Hallelujah! Extra time you can use to learn a new language, catch up at work, or even better, sleep in. This raises a lot of questions. First of all, is it true? Did the dam actually make our days longer? And if so, why? And just how much extra time are we talking about here? I mean, you need to plan your schedule, right? Should we build more giant dams to get even more time? To answer these questions, we need three basic physics ideas: (1) angular velocity, (2) angular momentum, and (3) the moment of inertia. I’ll explain each of these. First, here’s a little experiment that you can do yourself. If you have a rotating desk chair, get it spinning with your feet off the ground and your arms tucked in. Now, before you throw up, extend your arms. It slows you down, right? Here's a version with a human on a rotating platform: The speed of rotation is what we call angular velocity , represented by the Greek letter omega ( ω ). Why “angular”? Here’s a two-dimensional example below. Think of this circle as centered on an xy coordinate plane. I’ve drawn a radius ( R ) to a point on the circle where it cuts the horizontal axis: Now imagine this point moving counterclockwise around the circle. As it does, the radius line sweeps around like the second hand on a (backward) clock—and at any point in time, it forms an angle ( θ ) with the x axis. The faster the point moves around the circle, the faster that angle changes. Hence, “angular velocity.” To be specific, ω is defined by how much the angle changes ( Δθ ) in a certain increment of time ( Δt ). So if the spinning girl above completes one rotation in one second, we say she has an angular velocity of 360 degrees per second—or using radians, 2π radians per second.

Along with trying different designs that caught our eye at seven different holiday photo card sites, we uploaded our own designs to companies that offered the option, like Mixbook and Shutterfly. Also, we tried the premium line at Truly Engaging and designed our own card from scratch on Canva, in addition to using a premade design from the site. I had my friends and family look at the cards, pick the best photo quality, and choose which cards they liked best overall, and I also took into account price-to-value, print speed, and photo and paper quality.

With all those variables in mind, the clear winner for my friends, family, and me was Mixbook . Mixbook offers the best combination of design tools and photo quality among the cards I've tested. Next up is Vistaprint , which has less design customization, but impressive photo and print quality for the price. Read on to discover the details, and don't miss the Honorable Mentions for some fun designs like this one from Shutterfly , which my testers loved, even if it didn't make for a top pick.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nTrouble sleeping is often caused by stress chemicals, body clock shifts, stimulants, hidden sleep disorders, and certain health problems even when you dim the phone and laptop. Focus first on timing, routine, and simple tests that reveal what is really keeping you awake before trying new pills.​ Chronic pain, heartburn called gastroesophageal reflux disease, night time asthma, overactive thyroid, pregnancy, and menopause can all disturb sleep. Treat the underlying problem and adjust sleep position which often improves sleep quality.​ Overthinking and worry keep the brain alert and the fight or flight system active which blocks sleep onset and causes midnight wake ups. Write a to do list early evening and use a 15 minute wind down to shift the mind into rest mode. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia teaches these skills and is the first line treatment.​ Some antidepressants, beta blockers, diuretics, steroids, and late stimulants can disrupt sleep or cause frequent urination. Ask the doctor about dose timing or alternatives if sleep got worse after a medicine change.​ Going to bed early to catch up and staying in bed awake trains the brain to link bed with wakefulness. Keep a strict sleep window based on your average sleep time and only go to bed when sleepy. This is part of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and it works.​ Long naps reduce sleep pressure and very late heavy workouts can delay sleep. Keep naps short under 20 minutes before 3 PM and finish hard exercise at least four hours before bed. Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that can delay sleep and reduce deep sleep for hours while alcohol can fragment sleep later in the night. Stop caffeine and nicotine at least six hours before bed and skip nightcaps if you wake at 2 AM.​  ​ (Disclaimer: This story is not for professional medical advice and does not substitute any medical advice; it is strictly for educational purposes alone.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed \n\nAnswer:", "completion": " Trouble sleeping is often caused by stress chemicals, body clock shifts, stimulants, hidden sleep disorders, and certain health problems even when you dim the phone and laptop.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nA heart attack happens when blood flow in a coronary artery drops or stops, which injures the heart muscle; minutes matter because fast treatment can save heart tissue and life. Many people ignore early symptoms or mistake them for indigestion or stress, so learning the common signs helps you act quickly and call emergency medical services.​ What it feels like: A heavy pressure, squeezing, tightness, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest that lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back, sometimes with a burning or indigestion‑like feel. This is the classic sign and needs urgent evaluation, especially if it is new, severe, or different from usual heartburn.​ What it feels like: Spreading pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back between the shoulder blades, the neck or jaw, or the upper stomach area; it may be dull, heavy, tight, or unusual for you. These areas share nerve pathways with the heart, so pain can show up away from the chest and still be from the heart.​ What it feels like: Trouble breathing at rest or with light activity, with or without chest pain; you may feel you cannot get enough air, or you need to stop and catch your breath suddenly. Shortness of breath can be the first sign, sometimes minutes to hours before chest pain, and should not be ignored.​ What to watch: Cold sweat, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, feeling faint, a sudden wave of unusual tiredness, or a racing or irregular heartbeat. These can occur alone or together with chest symptoms, and the combination raises the chance that the heart is the problem.​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is not for professional medical advice and does not substitute any medical advice; it is strictly for educational purposes alone.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " A heart attack happens when blood flow in a coronary artery drops or stops, which injures the heart muscle; minutes matter because fast treatment can save heart tissue and life.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nMicroplastics are tiny plastic pieces that can act like weak hormones in the body and may interfere with normal signals of estrogen, testosterone, and thyroid hormones. They are smaller than 5 millimeters that can enter food and water from packaging, bottles, cookware, and the air. Heat moves more plastic chemicals into food, especially oily or spicy curries. Do not pour hot dal, sambhar, rasam, gravies, or biryani into plastic bowls, melamine, or disposable containers. Transfer hot food to stainless steel, glass, or ceramic. If ordering food, move it from plastic to steel plates or katoras as soon as it arrives. For fridge and pantry, choose stainless steel dabbas, glass jars, or good quality ceramic for leftovers and pickles. If plastic is the only option, use it only for cold and dry items like dry snacks, masalas in inner sachets, or short term storage. Check symbols and prefer polypropylene with the number 5 when needed. Avoid cracked or cloudy containers because damage increases leaching.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850.

But the department of telecommunications (DoT) and the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) were at odds over how spectrum should be treated in insolvency cases of Aircel and Reliance Communications (RCom), according to two people in the know, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal discussions. The DoT held that the spectrum is a natural resource and cannot be sold during liquidation, while the corporate affairs ministry was of the view that airwaves should be tradable so that creditors such as banks can recover their dues, the first of the two people quoted earlier said. RCom, Aircel and Videocon went bankrupt over 2018 and 2019, leaving unpaid statutory dues of over ₹ 40,000 crore. The Attorney General of India held meetings with the two ministries to understand the disagreements before presenting the final arguments in the court. The government’s stance was that the spectrum belongs to the state, held in trust for the public, and is not subject to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) . Queries emailed to DoT, the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) and the Attorney General did not elicit any response until press time. The telecom spectrum is a natural resource and constitutionally recognized as belonging to citizens of India, with the government acting as a trustee. The top court’s decision will determine whether airwaves can be liquidated under the IBC for lenders to recover dues. Airwaves blocked Banks used to lend to telecom operators against assets, including spectrum, as collateral. However, given"}

The devastating toll, which reduced Kittur Rani Chennamma Zoo's blackbuck population to seven, has prompted a high-level investigation from the government. According to sources at the zoo, eight antelopes died on Thursday, followed by 20 more deaths on Saturday. Three more blackbucks died at the facility in the last two days. Minister Khandre reached Belagavi and held a meeting with the zoo officials. Later speaking to reporters, Khandre expressed “deep pain” over the deaths and ordered an inquiry to determine the source and spread of the disease among the animals. “Prima facie, it is found that these blackbucks died due to bacterial infection. Our officers and veterinary doctors are giving treatment to them,” he said. The Minister said all precautionary measures are being taken to ensure that the disease does not spread to other zoos. “I have ordered a high-level probe to find out how this disease spread among blackbucks.

With about 3,500 e-buses being sold every year in the country, the government is working towards reducing the upfront cost as well as the operating cost of these e-buses. Mint explains the maths behind reducing the operating expenditure (opex) of state transport agencies running e-buses given that the upfront capital expenditure (capex) accounts for a higher share of the total cost of ownership (TCO) of such vehicles. Why do e-buses need fiscal support? The good news is that electric buses do not have carbon emissions. The bad? They are at least twice as expensive as diesel buses — often costing upwards of ₹ 1 crore an e-bus. So, the government has a programme, the ₹ 10,900-crore PM E-Drive scheme , to reduce the burden of the ‘green premium’ which in industry parlance is the extra cost consumers have to pay for using green products compared to less sustainable choices. More importantly, electric buses run for a relatively long period of time every day, unlike other vehicle segments such as scooters that largely remain idle for most of the day.

Commonly, fiscal incentives have always covered the upfront capital cost of the vehicle – the capex – not only in India, but across Europe and China. But, this is not the only cost of a vehicle.

While Congress leaders have described it as a courtesy meeting, sources suggest that Siddaramaiah may also discuss expanding the state's cabinet. Political circles within Karnataka , especially among the ruling Congress, have speculated for some time about a possible change in the chief ministership, pointing to a \"power-sharing\" agreement involving Siddaramaiah and D K Shivakumar, who serves as the state Congress president. However, Shivakumar has denied any plans to resign from his post, asserting that he “remains a disciplined soldier of the party”. He had met with the Congress leadership on Sunday. His remarks came amid speculation about a potential leadership change and Cabinet reshuffle in Karnataka, following Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's meeting with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi on Saturday. Shivakumar stressed that the decision regarding the reshuffle rests entirely with Siddaramaiah and will be carried out after consultations with the party's high command.

The decision follows concerns raised by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA), which brought the issue to the authorities' notice, noting that bullion dealers had been importing platinum-alloy jewellery duty-free, despite the products containing nearly 90% gold , along with small quantities of silver and platinum. The association urged authorities to close this loophole, as per a Reuters report.
