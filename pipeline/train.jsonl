{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAs CBSE gears up to offer class 10 students the option of giving board exams in select subjects twice from the 2026 exam onwards, CBSE Chairman Rahul Singh said that the Board expects a maximum of around 40% of students to appear in the second board exams in each of the main subjects. “We don’t expect…as a heuristic…we have taken that around 40% children will appear in each of the main subjects, in the second board exam, at max,” Singh said at a webinar on the CBSE two-board exam scheme on Thursday . Pointing out that the second exam will have a reduced evaluation load on teachers compared to the first, Singh said: “In the first board exam in class 10, the total number of answer books which are evaluated comes to around 1.5 crore…a bit more than that. We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Harshini Rathika Kishore Kumar Singh My interest in studying abroad began when I was in Class 12, when I completed my schooling at Vikaasa World School in Tamil Nadu , an international Cambridge-affiliated school. Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities. That one experience led me to establish an initiative, Rural Tech Rise, which has now reached more than 50 government schools through mobile libraries, robotics workshops, internet literacy sessions, and entrepreneurship programmes. Read More | No Indian institute in top 200 in QS Sustainability Rankings 2026 To scale Rural Tech Rise, I needed global experience, digital transformation skills, and cross-country partnerships — Deakin University matched every requirement.  Australia had been my dream long before I knew much about global education. As I grew older, its culture, warmth, safety, and international collaboration opportunities made perfect sense to me. Deakin was always my plan A. I spent nearly 10 years imagining this journey, and receiving the Deakin Vice-Chancellor’s 100% Scholarship changed my life. It gave me financial freedom, a community of outstanding scholars and the confidence to pursue my MBA (International) with a specialisation in Digital Transformation, aligned with my vision of strengthening India-Australia collaborations.

Since\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " — Harshini Rathika Kishore Kumar Singh My interest in studying abroad began when I was in Class 12, when I completed my schooling at Vikaasa World School in Tamil Nadu , an international Cambridge-affiliated school. Coming from a normal business family, the global curriculum exposed me to a world beyond my hometown. It made me think internationally for the first time. After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities. That one experience led me to establish an initiative, Rural Tech Rise, which has now reached more than 50 government schools through mobile libraries, robotics workshops, internet literacy sessions, and entrepreneurship programmes. Read More | No Indian institute in top 200 in QS Sustainability Rankings 2026 To scale Rural Tech Rise, I needed global experience, digital transformation skills, and cross-country partnerships — Deakin University matched every requirement.  Australia had been my dream long before I knew much about global education. As I grew older, its culture, warmth, safety, and international collaboration opportunities made perfect sense to me. Deakin was always my plan A. I spent nearly 10 years imagining this journey, and receiving the Deakin Vice-Chancellor’s 100% Scholarship changed my life. It gave me financial freedom, a community of outstanding scholars and the confidence to pursue my MBA (International) with a specialisation in Digital Transformation, aligned with my vision of strengthening India-Australia collaborations. Because this was a dream I held for years, I gave myself a full year to prepare – IELTS, scholarship essays, interviews, documents and visa I worked closely with a study abroad consultancy in Bengaluru.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments.

Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math.

The show-cause notice issued asks why legal action should not be initiated against the university, why the university should not be disqualified for future consideration for assessment and accreditation, and why NAAC should not recommend to the UGC, AICTE, NMC and NCTE that the institution’s recognition to offer programmes be withdrawn. NAAC has asked the university to respond in seven days, and has also asked that NAAC accreditation details be removed from the university website. The show-cause notice states Al-Falah University has publicly displayed on their website that “Al-Falah University is an endeavour of Al-Falah Charitable Trust, which has been running three colleges on the campus, namely Al Falah School of Engineering and Technology (since 1997, graded A by NAAC,) Brown Hill College of Engineering and Technology (since 2008), and Al-Falah School of Education and Training (since 2006, graded A by NAAC)”. The notice states that this “is absolutely wrong and misleading the public, especially parents, students, and stakeholders.” The senior NAAC official said: “They had two colleges that were accredited, and this accreditation period has expired.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process.

This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years. By 2023, the Telangana SSC exams returned closer to the usual time frame, being held from April 3 to April 13.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWhen the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ) was founded at Dholpur House in New Delhi in 1958, it marked a turning point in India’s education system – one that bore the imprint of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the country’s first education minister. Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road.

IIT Delhi Open House 2025 , which saw over 3,500 visitors, focused on ten key themes, including Healthcare, Biotechnology; Manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and Robotics; Smart and Sustainable Infrastructure; Advanced Material and Devices; Energy, Climate & Sustainability; Quantum & Semiconductor Technologies; Next Generation Communication; Management, Policy, Social Sciences; AI-ML/Data Science/Algorithms; and Fundamental Science. Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not?

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer.

It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services. Speaking at the launch, Education Minister Ashish Sood said the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India and Viksit Bharat 2047. The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said. The minister added that the app is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and will encourage skill-based learning while integrating activities under the Fit India initiative.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours.

The company’s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents. The startup’s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: “That’s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.” Sierra’s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM. Taylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra’s customers. The company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages — essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents.

And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds. Nowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment. For instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.” The app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time. “Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.” Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days. Another notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story.

She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time. “Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.” Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days. Another notable feature allows users to post spoilers while hiding them until others reach that part of the story. Each spoiler is initially blurred, giving users the choice of when to reveal it, which helps everyone stay on the same page. Phictly also includes a “Talk Points” featur"}

Livestreamers who watch SpaceX’s Starbase complex closely caught the explosion in the pre-dawn hours Friday, around 4:00 a.m. local time. Other creators in the area have since captured photos that offer a closer look at the damage. Unlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, according to Ars Technica . SpaceX said in a post on X that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. “The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday. The booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design in October .) It’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. The company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship.

Pinterest, however, was excluded, in line with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age (SMMA) rules. Twitch will no longer allow Australians under 16 to create accounts starting December 10, a Twitch spokesperson told TechCrunch. Existing accounts for users under 16 will be deactivated on January 9. Globally, Twitch is open to users 13 and older, and anyone under the legal age of adulthood in their region must have a parent or guardian involved, the spokesperson said. Pinterest did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Australia’s eSafety stated that Twitch is categorized as an “age-restricted social media platform” because the service is built around online social interaction and engagement features like livestreaming. Pinterest, on the other hand, is mainly used for collecting images and ideas, so it isn’t included in the age-restricted rules. Australia has said its underage social media ban, which will go into effect on December 10, will apply to Meta ‘s Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X, YouTube (except YouTube Kids and Google Classroom ), Reddit, and the local streaming service, Kick. These platforms will be required to block account access for users under 16, according to a statement by the internet regulator. About a year ago, Australia passed a law banning social media use for children under 16.

Digital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly $789 million) in losses in the first five months of 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Many incidents likely go unreported, either because victims are unsure how to file a complaint or wish to avoid additional scrutiny. On Thursday, Google announced the expansion of its real-time scam-detection feature, which uses Gemini Nano to analyze calls on-device and flag potential fraud without recording audio or sending data to Google’s servers. The feature is off by default and applies only to calls from unknown numbers, and it plays a beep during the conversation to notify participants.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer. In the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. Joby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole. “This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.” Archer was quick to strike back. “Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Joby’s case is entirely without merit.

When reached by email, GitLab spokesperson Emily James told TechCrunch that GitLab’s “security team is investigating and we’ll get back to you when we have more to share.” The prolific hacking group ShinyHunters told cybersecurity news website DataBreaches.net that it was behind the breach, adding that if Salesforce doesn’t negotiate with them, they will create a new website to advertise the stolen data — a common extortion tactic by financially-motivated cybercriminals. “The"}
{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nChatGPT is launching group chats globally to all users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans, OpenAI announced on Thursday. The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions. The company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options. Up to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. To start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo. It’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged. OpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos. The move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience. “Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nAt what age should a kid ideally get a smartwatch ? In China, parents are buying them for children as young as five. Adults want to be able to call their kids and track their location down to a specific building floor. But that’s not why children are clamoring for the devices, specifically ones made by a company called Xiaotiancai, which translates to Little Genius in English. The watches, which launched in 2015 and cost up to $330, are a portal into an elaborate world that blends social engagement with relentless competition. Kids can use the watches to buy snacks at local shops, chat and share videos with friends, play games, and, sure, stay in touch with their families. But the main activity is accumulating as many “likes” as possible on their watch’s profile page. On the extreme end, Chinese media outlets have reported on kids who buy bots to juice their numbers, hack the watches to dox their enemies, and sometimes even find romantic partners. According to tech research firm Counterpoint Research, Little Genius accounts for nearly half of global market share for kids’ smartwatches. Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle. She racked up more than one million likes and became a mini-celebrity on the platform. She said she met all three of her boyfriends through the watch, two of whom she broke up with because they asked her to send erotic photos. High like counts have become a sort of status symbol.

Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle. She racked up more than one million likes and became a mini-celebrity on the platform. She said she met all three of her boyfriends through the watch, two of whom she broke up with because they asked her to send erotic photos. High like counts have become a sort of status symbol. Some enthusiastic Little Genius users have taken to RedNote (or Xiaohongshu), a"}

The RAISE Act passed through New York’s legislature in June, and is due to be signed or vetoed by governor Kathy Hochul before the end of the year. It’s one of a handful of state AI safety bills across the country that attempt to regulate AI developers—even as the Trump administration readies an executive order aimed at thwarting state-level AI laws. This effort is what landed Bores squarely in the crosshairs of Leading the Future. In addition to backing from venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, the recently formed PAC is also funded by OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale. Andreessen Horowitz declined WIRED’s request for comment. Brockman and Lonsdale did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.

That’s what eCoffee Energyband, a Chinese gadget that sells for just over $100, is claiming to do. First released in late 2023, the product is a lightweight wearable with two electrode pads that sit against the inner wrist. WAT Medical , a Canadian company with a Chinese subsidiary making and marketing the device, claims the mild electrical signals sent by the wristband can keep wearers alert by stimulating nerves in the brain. The effect is supposedly about the same as a cup of coffee, minus the risk of caffeine addiction. The only side effect is that your hand could feel numb from the tip of the finger to the inner wrist, the company says, so the makers suggest that it only be worn for three hours a day, and users can switch which wrists they put it on. The gadget would likely have stayed in relative obscurity if the company that makes it had not attended a recent Chinese trade show, whereafter it suddenly went viral. “The purpose of inventing this eCoffee Energyband is not to replace coffee. Coffee is great, but it’s not always suitable for the afternoon or evening. But we still have the need to feel refreshed during those times,” Xu Haojie, the company’s director of operations, told Chinese state media Xinhua at the trade show. After wearing it, the Xinhua reporter said, “It feels like I’m being gently tapped. I can feel the electric pulse.” It immediately became a sensation online. On Chinese ecommerce websites, including JD and Taobao, the device appears to be sold out as of now, with hundreds of mixed reviews from buyers. The device is also sold and shipped to markets around the world. The website lists its normal price at $130, with a holiday promotion going on right now that knocks 30 percent off the price.

This “Pro” release is an iteration on its Nano Banana model that dropped earlier this year.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nBrain implant developer Paradromics has received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to test its device in an early-stage human trial, the company announced Thursday. The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They’ll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says.

For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves.

I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent. Similarly, since implementation of the Online Safety Act , Pornhub has lost nearly 80 percent of its UK viewership.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent.

But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use.

The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments.

Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on City Union Bank Despite broadly stable 1.5% RoA over the last 7 quarters, CUBK’s stock has underperformed peers due to concerns about subdued loan growth / NIM performance in arguably one of the best NIM cycle in recent times. Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

Earlier on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that the country is facing one of the most challenging moments in its history, as it weighs the implications of the US proposal, Al Jazeera reported.

Agarwal, who co-founded multiple startups and spent his entire adult life in Mumbai, wrote that he reached a turning point at 40. The city that once built his career, he says, no longer supported the quality of life he wanted. “I grew up in Sikkim. Small town. Moved to Mumbai for engineering. The city gave me everything — my career, my company, my adult life,” he wrote. But despite the professional ecosystem India offers, he admitted: “India has everything I need to build a business. Nothing I need to live well.” He has now moved to Bangkok — a decision he says was five years in the making. Even though his routine remains the same — “Gym. Office. Home.” — the quality of everyday life feels drastically different. Agarwal said the decision wasn’t about leaving India behind but about choosing a city that “doesn’t punish me for wanting a healthy, simple life”. His closing question — “If you had the chance to leave Mumbai for a better lifestyle, would you?” — has triggered a heated discussion on the platform, where many young professionals agree that worsening air quality, urban stress and lack of basic infrastructure are making them reconsider big-city living. As conversations around work-life balance and environmental well-being gain urgency, Agarwal’s post reflects a growing sentiment among India’s urban workforce: success may be easier to build in a metro, but a fulfilling life might lie elsewhere.

The area is located near the light rail line that takes travelers to the terminal and isn't behind a security checkpoint, according to maps of the airport posted on its website. The rail line to Terminal 1 was closed for about three hours, with shuttles taking people from other drop-off points, but it was reopened later Friday morning.

Clay said the man showed officers a knife when they tried to get him to move. Officers used Tasers, but the man continued to advance toward the officers and one of them fired their gun, fatally wounding the man, Clay said. “We don’t believe this was an individual trying to catch an airplane or coming into town,\" Clay said.

The meeting between both leaders, who have targeted each other, took place for the first time after the Democrat socialist got elected on November 4. \"We've just had a great... very productive meeting.

The US President said that there will be topics that they disagree on, adding, “I think we'll probably come to a conclusion. Ultimately, it's for the good of New York. If this city could be unbelievable — if he could be a spectacular success, I'd be very happy.” Earlier, Trump has called Mamdani a ‘100% Communist Lunatic’, a Jew hater and a ‘total nut job’.

Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan said the armed forces stand firmly with the bereaved family. \"General Anil Chauhan, CDS and all ranks of Indian Armed Forces deeply regret the incident in which an IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today.

The government has said the move aims to simplify rules and improve worker protection. A key change under the new codes is the definition of ‘wages’, which now includes basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance, with at least 50% of total remuneration counted as wages. Previously, employers often structured salary packages so that basic pay plus DA formed a small portion of total compensation, with large parts allocated to allowances that did not count towards benefits such as gratuity or provident fund. Under the new labour codes , every component of the cost-to-company (CTC) will now be treated as remuneration unless specifically exempted, with the maximum exemption capped at 50% of total compensation. “‘Wages’ now include basic pay, dearness allowance, and retaining allowance; 50% of the total remuneration (or such percentage as may be notified) shall be added back to compute wages, ensuring consistency in calculating gratuity, pension, and social security benefits,” an official statement said. The change is expected to impact the calculation of various social security contributions, including Provident Fund (PF), Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), Workmen’s Compensation, and maternity benefits. “The definition of ‘wage’ under the labour codes is likely to impact the base for calculation of various other social security contributions like Provident Fund, ESIC, Workmen's Compensation, Maternity Benefit etc. It will depend upon how individual employers have structured their salaries into different components,” said Madhu Damodaran, regional managing partner, AM Legals, a law firm.

Judgment reserved,” a division bench comprising Justice Anil Kshetarpal and Justice Harish Vaidyanathan Shankar said during the hearing, reported Live Law. Moitra had asked the Delhi HC to strike down the Lokpal’s 12 November order – claiming it ignored her submissions and violated basic principles of natural justice. No interim order, however, has been passed on Moitra's application for stay on the sanction order. The cash-for-query case centers on the allegation that Moitra had asked questions in the House in exchange for cash and gifts from businessman, Darshan Hiranandani. In her plea, Moitra sought to overturn the Lokpal November 12 order granting sanction to the CBI – arguing that the decision is flawed, violates the provisions of the Lokpal Act – and is a violation of principles of natural justice. Appearing for Moitra, Senior Advocate Nidhesh Gupta submitted that there was clear infirmity in the procedure adopted by the Lokpal as enumerated under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013. Citing Section 20(7), which requires the Lokpal to seek the public servant’s comments before granting sanction, Gupta said the Lokpal said that “I won't see any material at all” and granted sanction, mentioned a report by Live Law. The CBI – in July – had submitted its report to the Lokpal – months after registering an FIR on March 21, 2024, against Moitra and Hiranandani under the Prevention of Corruption Act.
