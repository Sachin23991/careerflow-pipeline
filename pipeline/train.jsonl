The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nEven as governments across major study-abroad destinations rethink immigration and student-visa policies — often tightening post-study work rights — London’s business ecosystem is sending a different message: global talent is not optional but central to the city’s economic model. A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill.

Times Higher Education is a UK-based magazine that releases an annual ranking of global and Asian universities, among others. The rankings, conducted in association with Schmidt Science Fellows, aim to benchmark how universities foster research that cuts across traditional academic boundaries. One of the key changes in this year’s edition is an expanded definition of “interdisciplinary science.” In addition to traditional STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) research, ISR 2026 now includes projects that combine scientific disciplines with non-STEM fields such as social sciences, law, economics, education, and clinical health.

Jamia Millia Islamia, positioned at 80, leads the performance among central universities, while SRM Institute of Science and Technology (89) and Amity University, Noida (97) also feature within the global top 100. Times Higher Education is a UK-based magazine that releases an annual ranking of global and Asian universities, among others. The rankings, conducted in association with Schmidt Science Fellows, aim to benchmark how universities foster research that cuts across traditional academic boundaries. One of the key changes in this year’s edition is an expanded definition of “interdisciplinary science.” In addition to traditional STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) research, ISR 2026 now includes projects that combine scientific disciplines with non-STEM fields such as social sciences, law, economics, education, and clinical health. The methodology behind the ranking relies on three core pillars, as per the press release. Inputs (19%) — measuring funds allocated to interdisciplinary research and industry support, Process (16%) — assessing infrastructure, administrative backing, promotion, and tenure policies for cross-disciplinary teams, and Outputs (65%) — the most heavily weighted pillar; includes publication volume, research quality, cross-disciplinary impact, and reputation among peers. Despite India’s numerical lead, the top ranks remain dominated by US universiti"}

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Siddharth Garg There is a widely believed misconception amongst students and parents, that if a student prepares rigorously for the Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), they will have to give up their preparation for the board exams . There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees.

This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty.

The Language and Cognition Laboratory, established within the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, is claimed as the first lab in India dedicated to systematically exploring the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation.

I come from Chandigarh , and completed both my Class 10 and Class 12 from Shivalik Public School. My school, and the city itself, gave me a strong sense of grounding. My academic interests started shaping there, especially as I took part in debates, science exhibitions, and extracurricular activities that built my interest in public affairs and law.  After schooling, I moved to Symbiosis Law School, Noida, under Symbiosis International (Deemed) University, to pursue my BA LLB. degree. Thanks to an academic collaboration between my college and the University of Birmingham, I was offered the chance to complete my LLM in International Law and Security in the UK while still being enrolled in my undergraduate law degree. Also Read | LLB vs BA LLB: Know differences in course structure, career implications and more What appealed to me most about the UK was the legacy and depth of legal education here. Studying law in the UK, especially international law, felt like being at the heart of the subject. The exposure to a highly diverse, globally aware classroom environment and the opportunity to learn from leading scholars in the field made the country an obvious choice. For the LLM, I did not apply to other universities. My path to the University of Birmingham was secured through the institutional agreement, and I viewed it as a rare opportunity. However, for my future academic ambitions, especially my PhD, I plan to apply w"}

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF).

Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight. To create that national standard, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk. A megabill such as this will likely take months, if not years, to become law, underscoring why the current rush to li"}

The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril’s unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.)

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe U.S. immigration system is complex, hard to navigate, and expensive for immigrants. The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained.

The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained.

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse. Edelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns. “OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” \n\nAnswer:", "completion": " In August, parents Matthew and Maria Raine sued OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, over their 16-year-old son Adam’s suicide, accusing the company of wrongful death.

Nevada-based Redwood employees around 1,200 employees, so the cuts affect a few dozen workers. The company, founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, initially focused on recycling scrap from battery cell production, consumer electronics, and used EV batteries.

Other standout, albeit older names, include Klarna and Spotify. On this week’s Equity, we sat down with Dennis Green-Lieber, the founder of the AI company Propane, to talk about the booming success of the Nordic ecosystem. Green-Lieber is based in Denmark and has been building in the ecosystem for the past 15 years. He chalked up the success of the ecosystem to a few things, including the region’s social safety that lets young people take risks without fear of losing everything. “The newer founders, new generations, are being way more bullish and taking ownership,” he told Equity. “I have not seen, in my 15 years, anything [like] what’s going on right now.” It’s becoming a hub for deep tech and AI, as one report put it, and is now valued at half a trillion dollars, with Nordic startups receiving a little more than $8 billion in venture investments in 2024. The government also plays a part in these companies, providing funding to startups, like Green-Lieber’s, to help founders grow their companies.

Its pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, and each serving also contains four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).

Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs.

So for this year's Black Friday, we sifted through the markdowns, cross-checked claims, verified third-party tests, and sampled the supplements so you don't have to. If you're looking to stock up or invest in a healthier routine, these are wellness supplements and protein powder deals we'd trust with both our own bodies and wallet. I'll be refreshing this list with the latest sales, so check back often. For more intel, check out our Best Black Friday Deals roundup or our Black Friday liveblog . Ritual Ritual Amazon Ritual’s Essential Protein Daily Shake is our top recommendation for women’s protein powder . It’s generally pricier than its competitors, but a $15 discount makes the cost more digestible. Its pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, and each serving also contains four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Ritual is a great supplement for sensitive stomachs as it’s free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial sweeteners. It’s also soy-free, gluten-free, and vegan. Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. It’s obviously made for protein shakes, but I personally prefer using this supplement in baked goods. Liquid I.V.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nMore than 2,000 years ago, pretty much every educated human knew the Earth was round. There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle. I mean, c’mon! But this is impressive: Around 240 BC, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt, came up with a brilliant way to calculate the radius of the spherical Earth. You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ). Using basic geometry, this meant the two cities were θ degrees apart on Earth’s 360-degree circumference.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool. Better hurry though, unlike most sales, Unbound Merino's Black Friday sale ends tonight. From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino?

On Amazon and the Ninja site, the Slushi is on sale for just $270, just in time for holiday gifts and holiday parties. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel I can attest to enjoying the Ninja Slushi immensely. I have made cold-brew slushie lattes, mimosa slushies, frosé slushies, daiquiri and margarita slushies, sour-beer slushies, Mike's Hard Mango Lemonade Slushies, and of course slushies made with fruit juice and simple syrup for parties full of children. All things cold and sweet are delicious. Best Black Friday Home and Beauty Deals (2025) Explore the story The Ninja Slushi was discounted to $300 as recently as October. At the time, this was the lowest I expected to see the price fall this year. Glad to be wrong, I guess. (But note that the smaller, Walmart-exclusive, 72-ounce Ninja Slushi machine is on sale for $250 , a price it's seen multiple times since last year.) Discounts often come when brands release next-generation devices. And in late October, Ninja released a big-boi update to the Slushi. The Slushi Max XXL is named a bit like an energy drink and holds a whopping 150 fluid ounces—making it the likely choice for frat houses and patio parties next year. We haven't tested it yet, but Ninja promises that the larger capacity also comes with faster freezing to keep pace. The Ninja Slushi Max, too, is on a steep sale. I"}

The study , \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak in Large Language Models (LLMs),” comes from Icaro Lab, a collaboration of researchers at Sapienza University in Rome and the DexAI think tank. According to the research, AI chatbots will dish on topics like nuclear weapons, child sex abuse material, and malware so long as users phrase the question in the form of a poem. “Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62 percent for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43 percent for meta-prompt conversions,” the study said. The researchers tested the poetic method on 25 chatbots made by companies like OpenAI , Meta , and Anthropic . It worked, with varying degrees of success, on all of them. WIRED reached out to Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI for a comment but didn’t hear back. The researchers say they’ve reached out as well to share their results. AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT have guardrails that prevent them from answering questions about “revenge porn” and the creation of weapons-grade plutonium. But it’s easy to confuse those guardrails by adding “ adversarial suffixes ” to a prompt. Basically, add a bunch of extra junk to a question and it confuses the AI and bypasses its safety systems. In one study earlier this year, researchers from Intel jailbroke chatbots by couching dangerous questions in hundreds of words of academic jargon. The poetry jailbreak is similar. “If adversarial suffixes are, in the model's eyes, a kind of involuntary poetry, then real human poetry might be a natural adversarial suffix,” the team at Icaro Lab, the researchers behind the poetry jailbreak, tell WIRED. “We experimented by reformulating dangerous requests in poetic form, using metaphors, fragmented syntax, oblique references.

The video, shared by creator director-dayal, is titled “Gareeb beta toh maa-baap ko bhi achha nahi lagta” and has struck a chord with thousands online. In the short clip, Dayal narrates an incident just three days after quitting his job and returning to his family home from another city. He recalls how things felt different when he was earning — a time when he felt valued for his contribution. Something as simple as his mother offering him extra rotis at dinner made him feel appreciated, he says. But that warmth, according to him, faded once he was no longer financially supporting the family. Dayal shares that when he recently asked for two extra rotis, his father instructed his mother in a matter-of-fact tone: “He’s asking for two more rotis, give them to him.” The change, he says, left him feeling invisible. Through his emotional monologue, Dayal questions why respect and affection for men are often tied to their income. “If you don’t earn, nobody respects you — not even family,” he says in the video. “Make money… Because if you don’t have it, nothing else matters.\" The video has sparked wide-ranging reactions — from empathy to uncomfortable agreement.

Less than two days after authorities said Rahmanullah Lakanwal opened fire on guard members, killing one and critically wounding another, Trump halted processing of Afghan immigration applications, ordered a review of all people approved for asylum in the previous administration, and signaled he would expand vetting under a travel ban on people coming from 19 countries.

However, for many Americans, the four-year college degree is not worth the cost. According to a poll by NBC, which surveyed 1,000 registered voters, 33% of them agree that a four-year college degree is ‘worth the cost’. They believe that it leads to a better chance of getting a good job and earning more money over their lifetime. However, in contrast to that, 63% of people think it is ‘not worth the cost’ because people often graduate without specific job skills. The poll was conducted via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message between October 24 and 28. According to the survey, the respondents feel that the rising costs are a major reason why the value of a four-year degree has been undercut. In 2017, 49%of US adults said a degree was worth the cost and 47% said it wasn’t. Whereas, in 2013, a CNBC survey revealed that 40% believed the degree was not worth it compared to 53% who said it was worth it. The report states that the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that those with advanced degrees earn more and have lower unemployment rates than those with lower levels of education. Stating that some people drop out, Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said, “Sometimes people end up with a degree that is not worth a lot in the labor market, and sometimes people pay way too much for a degree relative to the value of what that credential is.”  Recently, a report published by Oxford Economics says that a key reason unemployment has been rising faster among younger age groups is because many are either entering the labor market for the first time or are reentering the labor market after graduating from college. “The current no-hire, no-fire labor market – and the prospect of a jobless expansion – is an enormous challenge for members o\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " A college degree is more or less seen as the first step or a ladder towards achieving a career goal or an opportunity to further explore new avenues.
