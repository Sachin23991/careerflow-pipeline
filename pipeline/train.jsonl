NEET UG 2026 Physics Preparation Tips to Score 180 Marks Biology beautifully unfolds into two fascinating branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany lets you explore the world of plants, their structure, diversity, colours, and the incredible processes that keep our environment balanced. It helps you understand how genes pass from one generation to another and how biotechnology enhances human life. NEET UG 2026 Chemistry Preparation Tips Zoology brings you closer to the inner workings of living beings, such as respiration, blood circulation, and reproduction. It’s a deep dive into how the human body maintains harmony every single second. Together, these branches not only help you score well but also allow you to appreciate how life thrives in every form around you. If you want to master NEET Biology, strategy matters as much as study hours. Here’s how you can prepare smartly: –Make NCERT your foundation. It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly. Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly. Weekly or monthly revisions keep concepts"}

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments.

Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWhen the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ) was founded at Dholpur House in New Delhi in 1958, it marked a turning point in India’s education system – one that bore the imprint of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the country’s first education minister. Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas.

The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe New Zealand government has announced the implementation of a series of immigration changes under its International Education Going for Growth Plan, first unveiled in July 2025. The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date. Immigration officials note that not all visa holders are expected to apply immediately for the additional five hours, as some may wait until their next visa renewal or may be nearing the end of their studies. The government has also extended in-study work rights to all tertiary students participating in approved exchange or Study Abroad programmes, including one-semester courses — a change designed to make New Zealand’s universities and colleges more appealing to international learners.

The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date. Immigration officials note that not all visa holders are expected to apply immediately for the additional five hours, as some may wait until their next visa renewal or may be nearing the end of their studies. The government has also extended in-study work rights to all tertiary students participating in approved exchange or Study Abroad programmes, including one-semester courses — a change designed to make New Zealand’s universities and colleges more appealing to international learners. In another key clarification, students who change their education provider or lower their level of study — such as moving from a degree to a diploma — will"}

It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field.

A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly"}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush.

Nearly half of them believe their roles AI can make a switch in their jobs within the next three to five years. According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations. Among those worried that artificial intelligence could replace their roles, at least 40% are actively considering an exit.

Small mistakes in these final days can undo months of efforts – countless practice, revision on the loop, repeated mock attempts and performance analysis – all can go into vain. It happens with the best of the best. The following is the list of the most common mistakes aspirants make close to the CAT and how you can avoid them – walking into the exam with focus and confidence. In the final stretch, many aspirants fall into the “more mocks = more improvement” trap. This happens especially with the ones who start their preparation late. Many of the aspirants start writing a full-length mock every day or worse, trying to attempt two mocks a day. This process does more harm than good. This leads to a drop in accuracy (result of inadequate post mock analysis), fatigue build up and drop in confidence. Reduce mock frequency to 2-3 per week and focus on deep analysis. Ask yourself questions like: Which questions did I choose wrongly? Did I waste time on a trap set? Did I panic midway? You need to chase understanding rather than scores and focus on exam attempt strategy. In the process of trying to cover left over topics, strengthening certain topics, attempting more than required mocks – candidates often miss adequate revision. They keep taking tests without revising their basics – forgetting one small formula or concept mid-exam can cost valuable marks. Well, the right course is to create a formula/trick/revision book while you are covering the concepts. If that is not done, create one quickly.

The social network said it will also give users badges for controlling their TikTok usage. The company is redesigning its screen time management page and adding new features to it. These include an affirmation journal with more than 120 positive prompts that let users set your intent for the day, a sound generator that can play calming sounds like rain or ocean waves, and a breathing exercise module. The company said that the page will also feature content from creators who talk about limiting screen time, using parental tools, and customizing their feeds. TikTok is also debuting new badges to reward people who use the platform within limits, especially teens. The company said it reviewed academic literature on digital well-being and found that overly restrictive tools can have a negative effect on teens. To earn these badges, users need to complete different missions. Users can complete the sleep hours mission by avoiding using the platform at night. They can also use the new meditation tools to get a badge. TikTok is also rewarding people who set a daily screen time limit and use the app within those bounds with a badge. There are other badges for viewing the weekly screen time report and inviting others to complete these missions. The company said that during its early testing, it observed that more people visited the new well-being screen compared to the previous version of the screen time menu, with the affirmation journal being the most popular tool.

Here’s why. Three years ago, Jeep unveiled how it was reshaping its portfolio with the launch of three EVs — two of which were bound for the North American market by 2024. The all-electric Jeep Recon and Wagoneer S models were part of the brand’s plan to dominate to the electrified SUV market. At the time, parent company Stellantis was aiming for EVs to make up half of Jeep’s sales in North America — and all of its sales in Europe — by 2030. The Wagoneer S eventually came to market in early 2025, while the Jeep Recon remained in limbo. Meanwhile, most automakers, including Stellantis, which also owns Chrysler and Ram, began to backpedal on ambitious EV plans as demand failed to meet lofty forecasts. In September, Ram canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup , opting to focus on bringing an extended-range Ram 1500 REV to market. A month later, Stellantis announced it would invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO.

At an Axios event on Tuesday, the entrepreneur behind the popular AI platform and community site agreed that bubble talk is today’s “trillion-dollar question,” but said he doesn’t believe AI’s future is at risk if the bubble bursts. Instead, as Delangue sees it, it’s large language models (LLMs) — like those powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and other chatbots — that are receiving outsized attention, and that attention may not last. “I think we’re in an LLM bubble, and I think the LLM bubble might be bursting next year,” explained Delangue. “But ‘LLM’ is just a subset of AI when it comes to applying AI to biology, chemistry, image, audio, [and] video. I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years,” he noted. One issue, he argued, is that LLMs aren’t the right solution for everything, and smaller, more specialized models will see increased adoption in the future. “I think all the attention, all the focus, all the money, is concentrated into this idea that you can build one model through a bunch of compute and that is going to solve all problems for all companies and all people,” said Delangue. “I think the reality is that you’ll see in the next few months, next few years, kind of like a multiplicity of models that are more customized, specialized, that are going to solve different problems.” As an example, he suggested the use case of a banking customer chatbot. “You don’t need it to tell you about the meaning of life, right?

The FTC did manage to surface evidence showing that Meta — then called Facebook — was concerned about Instagram’s fast growth and the competition it could pose. “One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying is time,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote in February 2012, per internal Facebook emails that surfaced during the trial. “Even if some new competitors springs [sic] up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare, etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.” But Judge Boasberg was not ruling on whether Meta had acted as a monopoly back then, but rather, if it is currently a monopoly. Boasberg pointed to apps like TikTok as evidence that Meta has competition. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote in his memorandum opinion. “While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.”  Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nPoe, Quora’s app that brings together different AI models into one platform, is launching group chat functionality. The company announced on Monday that users worldwide will be able to start group chats with up to 200 other people, then collaborate across more than 200 AI models — including text, image, video, and audio generators — within a single conversation. The launch comes just days after OpenAI’s ChatGPT began piloting group chats in markets like Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. The move could potentially transform the chatbot from a one-on-one AI interaction into a collaborative space where users can also engage with friends, family, or colleagues. Quora says the addition of group chats to Poe could enable new types of interactive experiences for AI users. For instance, the company suggests that families or friends could use the feature to plan a trip together using Gemini 2.5’s search functionality and o3 Deep Research. Teams could also work together to brainstorm images for mood boards using the various image models on Poe, or groups could play trivia games together using one of the quiz bots on the app. The group chats will allow users to work together using any combination of AI models or creator-made bots, including models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet, ElevenLabs v3, ElevenLabs Music, Nano Banana, GPT-5.1, Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro, o3 Deep Research, Sora 2 Pro, and Veo 3.1, among others. Poe users can start a group chat from the app’s home screen on the website at poe.com. As you chat, the chat history will sync in real time across your devices, so you could start chatting on desktop and then move to a mobile device without losing the thread.

The “LPs” who fund VCs are confronting an asset class in flux: Funds have nearly twice the lifespan they used to, emerging managers face life-or-death fundraising challenges, and billions of dollars sit trapped in startups that may never justify their 2021 valuations. Indeed, at a recent StrictlyVC panel in San Francisco, above the din of the boisterous crowd gathered to watch it, five prominent LPs, representing endowments, fund-of-funds, and secondaries firms managing over $100 billion combined, painted a surprising picture of venture capital’s current state, even as they see areas of opportunity emerging from the upheaval. Perhaps the most striking revelation was that venture funds are living far longer than anyone planned for, creating a raft of problems for institutional investors. “Conventional wisdom may have suggested 13-year-old funds,” said Adam Grosher, a director at the J. Paul Getty Trust, which manages $9.5 billion. “In our own portfolio, we have funds that are 15, 18, even 20 years old that still hold marquee assets, blue-chip assets that we would be happy to hold.” Still, the “asset class is just a lot more illiquid” than most might imagine based on the history of the industry, he said. This extended timeline is forcing LPs to rip up and rebuild their allocation models. Lara Banks of Makena Capital, which manages $6 billion in private equity and venture capital, noted her firm now models an 18-year fund life, with the majority of capital actually returning in years 16 through 18. Meanwhile, the J. Paul Getty Trust is actively revisiting how much capital to deploy, leaning toward more conservative allocations to avoid overexposure. The alternative is active portfolio management through secondaries, a market that has become essential infrastructure. “I think every LP and every GP should be actively engaging with the secondary market,” said Matt Hodan of Lexington Pa\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " These days, it’s not easy to be a limited partner who invests in venture capital firms.

Perhaps the most striking revelation was that venture funds are living far longer than anyone planned for, creating a raft of problems for institutional investors. “Conventional wisdom may have suggested 13-year-old funds,” said Adam Grosher, a director at the J. Paul Getty Trust, which manages $9.5 billion. “In our own portfolio, we have funds that are 15, 18, even 20 years old that still hold marquee assets, blue-chip assets that we would be happy to hold.” Still, the “asset class is just a lot more illiquid” than most might imagine based on the history of the industry, he said. This extended timeline is forcing LPs to rip up and rebuild their allocation models. Lara Banks of Makena Capital, which manages $6 billion in private equity and venture capital, noted her firm now models an 18-year fund life, with the majority of capital actually returning in years 16 through 18. Meanwhile, the J. Paul Getty Trust is actively revisiting how much capital to deploy, leaning toward more conservative allocations to avoid overexposure. The alternative is active portfolio management through secondaries, a market that has become essential infrastructure. “I think every LP and every GP should be actively engaging with the secondary market,” said Matt Hodan of Lexington Pa"}

Launched in August , the productivity tool lets you block yourself from distracting phone apps while encouraging you with the aid of a virtual friend — a little cartoon bean that likes to knit socks and scarves, which can later be exchanged for décor for the little bean’s room. The premise behind the app is that users might be encouraged to manage their screen time better if they know their actions would impact others, even if it’s just a little bean that would be sad if you interrupted their knitting project. The app was a hit at launch, reaching No. 1 on Apple’s App Store after rapidly climbing the charts . On Android, Focus Friend has north of 1 million installs, according to its Play Store listing . Google calls Focus Friend a helpful and cute app and an effective tool for helping users disconnect. In a year that again saw AI assistants and tools climb the app store charts over and over again, it’s interesting to see a timer that helps you disconnect from your tech winning Google’s highest app award. On Google Play, for instance, the top apps currently include both of OpenAI’s consumer-facing tools: ChatGPT (at No. 1), and video app Sora. Other top apps focus on social media, entertainment, or shopping, like TikTok, WhatsApp, Instagram, Temu, and GoWish.

Coming just seven months after the Gemini 2.5 release , the new model is Google’s most capable LLM yet, and an immediate contender for the most capable AI tool on the market. The release also comes less than a week after OpenAI released GPT 5.1, and a mere two months after Anthropic released Sonnet 4.5 — a reminder of the blistering pace of frontier model development. A more research-intensive version of the model, called Gemini 3 Deepthink, will also be made available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks, once it passes further rounds of safety testing. “With Gemini 3, we’re seeing this massive jump in reasoning,” said Tulsee Doshi, Google’s head of product for the Gemini model. “It’s responding with a level of depth and nuance that we haven’t seen before.” Some of that reasoning power is already registering on independent benchmarks. With a score of 37.4, the model marked the highest score on record on the Humanity’s Last Exam benchmark , meant to capture general reasoning and expertise. The previous high score, held by GPT-5 Pro, was 31.64. Gemini 3 also topped the leaderboard on LMArena, a human-led benchmark that measures user satisfaction. According to Google, the Gemini app currently has more than 650 million monthly active users, and 13 million software developers have used the model as part of their workflow. Alongside the base model, Google also released a Gemini-powered coding interface called Google Antigravity , allowing for multi-pane agentic coding similar to agentic IDEs like Warp or Cursor 2.0.

The social network says the feature lets users chat about what’s happening in the world and across various communities, from Formula 1 to the reality TV show “Below Deck.” Profiles will remain private to anyone you’re not friends with, helping prevent unwanted friend requests or direct messages, Snapchat says. While a user’s display name will be visible next to their message, others won’t be able to tap through to their profile from a Topic Chat, the company told TechCrunch in an email. And unlike usernames, display names can’t be used to search for someone. Snapchat told TechCrunch that it will use LLM technology and other safety measures to moderate Topic Chats to keep them safe and appropriate. Additionally, messages must adhere to Snapchat’s Community Guidelines, and users can report inappropriate messages. The company says it will take action against users who violate its policies, including warning users and blocking accounts.

Priced at ₹109, the company’s shares climbed as high as ₹161.99 before closing at ₹156.49, valuing it at ₹448 billion (around $5 billion). That’s well above its listing valuation of ₹315 billion (approximately $3.6 billion), and roughly 79% higher than its last private valuation of $2.8 billion in September 2024. Physics Wallah raised ₹34.8 billion (around $393 million) in the IPO. Of this, ₹31 billion (approximately $350.1 million) was through a fresh issue of shares, while ₹3.8 billion (roughly $42.9 million) worth of shares were sold by co-founders Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob, who together held about 80% of the company before the listing. The strong IPO highlights the company’s remarkable growth arc since its humble beginnings as a YouTube channel run by Pandey in 2016. It now stands out in an industry otherwise reeling from layoffs, a funding drought, and the unraveling of once-high-flying rival Byju’s.

Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour. An in-depth investigation by The 74 reveals how nicotine-addicted teens, who often begin vaping under social pressure or, like Gutierrez, to cope with hardship, are routinely kicked out of school instead of receiving meaningful services that could steer them away from tobacco and help them break free of their vape pens.

My vibe is usually more mini-golf than shotgun-wielding, but the game has overall positive reviews, and scary stuff can be a lot of fun in VR.

Agent 365 is not a platform for making enterprise AI tools; it’s a way to manage them, as if they were human employees . Companies using generative AI agents in their digital workplace can use Agent 365 to organize their growing sprawl of bots, keep tabs on how they’re performing, and tweak their settings. The tool is rolling out today in Microsoft’s early access program. Essentially, Microsoft created a trackable workspace for agents . “Tools that you use to manage people, devices, and applications today, you'd want to extend them to run agents as well in the future,” says Charles Lamanna, a president of business and industry for Microsoft’s Copilot , its AI chatbot. Lamanna envisions a future where companies have many more agents performing labor than humans. For example, if a company has 100,000 employees, he sees them as using “half a million to a million agents,” ranging in tasks from simple email organization to running the “whole procurement process” for a business. He claims Microsoft internally uses millions of agents.

As talk of an AI bubble grows, the company is keen to stress that its latest release is more than just a clever model and chatbot—it’s a way of improving Google’s existing products, including its lucrative search business, starting today. “We are the engine room of Google, and we're plugging in AI everywhere now,” Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind, an AI-focused subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told WIRED in an interview ahead of the announcement. Hassabis admits that the AI market appears inflated, with a number of unproven startups receiving multibillion-dollar valuations. Google and other AI firms are also investing billions in building out new data centers to train and run AI models, sparking fears of a potential crash. But even if the AI bubble bursts, Hassabis thinks Google is insulated. The company is already using AI to enhance products like Google Maps, Gmail, and Search. “In the downside scenario, we will lean more on that,” Hassabis says. “In the upside scenario, I think we've got the broadest portfolio and the most pioneering research.” Google is also using AI to build popular new tools like NotebookLM , which can auto-generate podcasts from written materials, and AI Studio which can prototype applications with AI. It’s even exploring embedding the technology into areas like gaming and robotics, which Hassabis says could pay huge dividends in years to come, regardless of what happens in the wider market.

It's not just about finding a comfortable seat—the best desk chairs employ the right materials to whisk body heat away, and are adjustable enough to tailor the chair to your body. There are so many options at varying prices, and my job over the last few years has been to test dozens, like budget-friendly chairs from Staples to Herman Miller classics. My favorite office chair for most people is the Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro because it strikes a good balance between price and features, but not every recommendation will work for every person. We all have different body types, which is why we've put together a collection of our favorites. Hopefully, there's a home office chair for you here.

Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store I often hear gasps when I tell people how much they should probably spend on an office chair. Most people just aren't ready to fork over more than $1,000. That's one of the big reasons why Branch's Ergonomic Chair Pro is our best office chair recommendation for most people. At $499, it's not egregiously expensive, has a decent warranty period, and checks off a lot of boxes in build quality, comfort, and ergonomics.

It's not just about finding a comfortable seat—the best desk chairs employ the right materials to whisk body heat away, and are adjustable enough to tailor the chair to your body. There are so many options at varying prices, and my job over the last few years has been to test dozens, like budget-friendly chairs from Staples to Herman Miller classics. My favorite office chair for most people is the Branch Ergonomic Chair Pro because it strikes a good balance between price and features, but not every recommendation will work for every person. We all have different body types, which is why we've put together a collection of our favorites. Hopefully, there's a home office chair for you here. Check out our other home office buying guides, including the Best Standing Desks , Best Laptop Stands , Best Home Office Gear , Best Mechanical Keyboards , and Best Webcams . Updated November 2025: We’ve added the LiberNovo Omni and Hon Nucleus drafting chair. Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store I often hear gasps when I tell people how much they should probably spend on an office chair. Most people just aren't ready to fork over more than $1,000. That's one of the big reasons why Branch's Ergonomic Chair Pro is our best office chair recommendation for most people. At $499, it's not egregiously expensive, has a decent warranty period, and checks off a lot of boxes in build quality, comfort, and ergonomics.

It’s not just a dual-ended vibrator , offering up G-spot stimulation on one end and clitoral stimulation on the other, but it also features something you don’t see every day: a pussy pump . It's not the friendliest-looking sex toy. Unlike traditional vibrators that can be easily categorized as wands or rabbits, the suction cup and the flicking tongue make it look like nothing else that came before. But who cares if it looks like a probe from a sci-fi flick—does it do the job? First up: the vibrating dildo. It’s here you’ll find five extremely powerful vibration intensities packed into the textured shaft, ideal for G-spot or P-spot stimulation. Because this part of the toy also doubles as an ergonomic handle, it has some weight to it and is more girthy than many internal vibrators. That allows the G-spot stimulator to cover more area, making those rumbles feel more intense than they normally would. I typically like stronger vibrations, but I didn’t feel the need to turn things up past the third level on the Lick to find the sweet spot. Le Wand Lick 3-in-1 Rechargeable Double-Ended Vibrator Rating: 8/10 When you flip the Lick around, things look more complicated—especially if you’re new to suction play—but if you take your time to understand these features, you’ll be a happy camper. On this end, you have a suction cup and a tongue-shaped clitoral stimulator. Remove the cup—just a quick twist and it’s off—you can easily access the flicking tongue. The tongue has three speeds that, with a bit of water-based lube , are meant to mimic the sensation of oral sex. It didn’t feel much like oral sex to me, which probably says more about my partners than the Lick, but it felt great against my clitoris. So much so that this was my favorite function of the Lick.

First off, hair straighteners are somewhat subjective. People have different hair, and types of hair, and ideas of what they'd like their hair to look like. A high-heat titanium iron might be a godsend for someone with 4b coily hair, but could destroy another person's fine, 2a wavy hair.

Our top pick, the 1.25-inch Paul Mitchell Smooth+ ($130) , is a Goldilocks iron. It's proven for longevity (former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has had hers since college), it's got ceramic plates that are safe even for fine hair and beginners, and the wide plates have enough power for hard-to-straighten hair but aren't so wide they inhibit maneuverability.

It has also made Huang very rich, but he isn’t always painted in a flattering light, which helps to counterbalance the founder worship vibe. For a slightly different view on Nvidia's history, try The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant , by Tae Kim.  Amazon Bookshop.org by Tracy Kidder A well-deserved winner of the Pulitzer Prize, this book should be required reading for anyone who works in technology or harbors a curiosity about how it came to dominate our lives. First published in 1981, the book reveals the inner workings of Data General in the 1970s as the company strives to design and release a successful next-generation minicomputer. Kidder captures the struggle between management and creatives and weaves a fascinating"}

(John does not want his real name used due to fear of friends finding out.) When used in high doses, diphenhydramine, an ingredient in Benadryl, functions as a deliriant, a hallucinogenic class of drugs, which appear to be becoming increasingly popular among young people for nonmedical purposes.

According to the people I spoke to, every trip is bad, every trip is brutal, and that’s the point.

Simo hasn’t been seen much at OpenAI’s San Francisco office since she began as CEO of Applications in August. But her presence is felt at every level of the company—not least because she’s heading up ChatGPT and basically every function that might make OpenAI money.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States.

How much these substances impact you isn't scientifically settled, but one way to avoid possible harm is to get a natural mattress made from organic materials.

Birch Birch Birch's Luxe organic mattress is again our top pick because it's so well-rounded. It's a great organic model that offers good support, but also a good bit of pressure relief (Birch calls it a medium-firm mattress). It's a little on the bouncy side, meaning that it springs back a good bit when you turn around, which makes it a good choice for back sleepers, since you're well supported. The Birch Luxe is made of natural materials and uses individually wrapped steel coils, which are topped with layers of organic latex and wool, capped off with a GOTS-certified organic cotton cover. The coils offer full lumbar support and are arranged to cradle your spine but are also stiff around the edge\n\nAnswer:", "completion": " Birch Avocado Mattress Naturepedic S&S Organic Mattress You’re going to be sleeping for roughly 23 years of your life, on average, so why not choose the best organic mattress?

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nShaadi season means hands are everywhere: selfies, boomerangs, ring exchange shots. Every haldi closeup and mehendi video puts your manicure front and center. That is why nails deserve as much thought as your lehenga. These five designs blend tradition with current trends and look flawless under wedding lights and on camera. Chrome finishes (especially silver and rose gold) have officially replaced classic red as bride favourites. They shine like jewellery, need zero extra embellishment, and elevate ivory or pastel lehengas instantly. Just smooth base plus chrome powder. Under mandap (wedding canopy) lights, they steal every frame. Tiny pearls, studs, crystals, or gold foil turn nails into wearable art. Perfect for mehendi and sangeet when you want bling that complements (not competes with) your bangles. Keep the base nude or blush so embellishments pop. Skip chunky stones if you are wearing heavy handpieces though. Chrome or 3D: engagement, cocktail, reception. Pastels melting from pink to white or lavender to nude give that fresh, ethereal vibe. Bridesmaids love this because it pairs effortlessly with organza sarees and chikankari. Add subtle glitter dust at tips or a fine metallic line to make it shaadi appropriate without overwhelming the aesthetic. Red still rules Indian weddings, but 2025 versions come with chrome finishes, velvet texture, or minimal gold foil accents. It photographs brilliantly (kalire, bouquet, groom's hand shots all look cinematic) and feels both traditional and modern. Skip flat matte; go glossy or reflective instead. Red (classic or upgraded): traditional pheras. Think Alia Bhatt vibes. Clean, refined, old money energy. Beige, latte, caramel, warm almond shades fit every outfit and every function without clashing. Add thin French tips, tiny white dots, or gold lines if plain feels too boring. Ideal when your Kanjeevaram or mirror work lehenga does the talking. Ombre or nude: haldi, day weddings, roka ceremonies.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nManaging PCOS isn’t just about medication, lifestyle changes play a huge role too. In a recent post, nutritionist Mohita Mascarenhas highlighted simple daily habits that can ease symptoms naturally. These shifts support hormones , balance blood sugar , and improve long-term health for women with PCOS. Losing excess body fat can significantly improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and regulate periods . Even a 5-10% weight reduction can make a huge difference in PCOS symptoms . Focus on sustainable habits, not extreme dieting. Low daily movement worsens insulin resistance , so staying active is key. A 10-15 minute walk after meals can help control blood sugar spikes and improve digestion . Small, consistent steps matter more than intense workouts alone. Strength training at least 3 times a week boosts metabolism , reduces insulin resistance, and supports hormone health . Building muscle is especially beneficial for women with PCOS because it helps the body use glucose more efficiently. Alcohol and smoking worsen inflammation, disrupt hormones , and increase oxidative stress . Cutting them out can dramatically improve energy , mood, and overall PCOS management . Your hormones will thank you. Getting 8-10 hours of sleep supports metabolism, stabilizes hunger hormones , and reduces stress levels . Poor sleep can worsen cravings, weight gain, and insulin resistance, all common PCOS challenges . Chronic stress triggers cortisol spikes, which throw hormones further off balance. Incorporate calming habits like meditation , breathing exercises , yoga , or simple evening wind-down routines. Even 10 minutes a day can help. These lifestyle shifts may look simple, but together they can make PCOS more manageable and improve overall wellbeing. As nutritionist Mohita Mascarenhas reminds, consistency is everything.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

The company, which provides ride-hailing services, is aiming to tap more cities in the United States as it intensifies efforts to solidify its lead position in self-driving technology. The company said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that it plans to roll out fully autonomous vehicle operations in at least four more US cities — including Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando — in the coming weeks ahead of a public launch for riders in 2026. “Get ready.

Currently, Waymo is the only operator offering paid robotaxi rides in the US that are fully driverless, meaning they operate without safety drivers or in-vehicle monitors. Waymo's aggressive expansion highlights the intensifying competition in the market to commercialise fully autonomous vehicles, with leading players focusing on safety, technology refinement and regulatory cooperation to secure market share, Reuters said in a news report. Rivals such as Tesla and Amazon's Zoox are also heavily investing in autonomous technology. Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced last month that the electric carmaker aims to introduce its robotaxi service in eight to 10 metro areas of the United States by the end of this year, subject to regulatory approval.

Katyal was taken into custody on Monday by the agency's Gurugram zonal office under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ). Following his arrest, a special court in Gurugram has sent him to six days of ED custody for further investigation, according to a news report by PTI.

The federal agency had already charge-sheeted the businessman in August in a third case for allegedly collecting over ₹ 500 crore from homebuyers for housing plots through another firm, Krrish Realtech, where he is a promoter. He was also accused for allegedly diverting around ₹ 205 crore from the collected funds to a hotel project in Sri Lanka. The ED said in its chargesheet that it is investigating complaints from a number of homebuyers across the country, many of them registered in the Delhi NCR region, Mint reported earlier. The proceeds generated from this alleged fraud were “immediately diverted” to the personal accounts of Katyal and other “shell” (paper) companies, which are owned by him and his family members, the Mint report said. The accused reportedly appointed “dummy” directors in these shell companies, who held various immovable properties.   Stay updated with the lates"}

Vembu seconded Chaudhary's views, saying, \"I agree with you. My earlier post talked about the cost of living c"}

According to a report by Chinese news outlet The Paper, Liu Jinsong, director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s Asian Affairs Department, said he was “dissatisfied” with the result of his meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Masaaki Kanai. Relations between the two neighbours have soured recently after Takaichi became the first sitting Japanese leader in decades to publicly link a Taiwan Strait crisis with the possible deployment of Japanese troops. Her remarks drew swift retaliation from Beijing , which warned of more to come. China has demanded that Takaichi retract her statement, and state media blasted her comments, saying they “sound a stark warning that Japan’s militarist demons are being summoned anew.” Japan, meanwhile, said Kanai reiterated that the country’s position on Taiwan remains unchanged. Kanai also pushed back against “extremely inappropriate statements” made by Xue Jian, China’s consul general in Osaka, who threatened to cut off Takaichi’s head in a now-deleted post on X. Tokyo demanded immediate action against the diplomat. The back-and-forth between the two sides suggests the dispute shows little sign of easing. Beijing has also warned Chinese citizens against travelling to Japan. This move has already led at least two state-owned travel agencies to scrap group tours to Japan, booked months in advance, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The travel warning triggered a sharp selloff in Japan’s biggest tourism and retail stocks before they recovered some of their losses.
