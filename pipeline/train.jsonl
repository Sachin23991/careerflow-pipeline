{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nNTA JEE Main Registration 2026: The National Testing Agency (NTA) on November 27 will close the registration window for JEE Main 2026 Session 1. Candidates yet to register for the engineering entrance test can do so by 5 pm tomorrow. The official website to register for JEE Main session 1 is jeemain.nta.nic.in. However, for many candidates who either missed the deadline or made mistakes in their submitted application, the days following the closure of the registration window often bring anxiety and confusion. NTA will be opening the JEE Main application correction window on December 1. For students who could not apply for Session 1, NTA provides some relief. As per the JEE Main cycle, Session 2 registrations will open in early January 2026. This second window allows fresh applicants to register and those registered earlier to attempt the exam again for score improvement. Missing Session 1 does not disqualify a candidate from the exam altogether. In fact, many students prefer appearing only in Session 2 for better preparation time, board exam alignment, or logistical comfort. The scores from either attempt or the best of the two will be considered for admission to NITs, IIITs, GFTIs, and eligibility for JEE Advanced. However, missing Session 1 does mean losing an additional attempt, which could affect confidence and familiarity with the computer-based format. Candidates are advised to closely monitor the official NTA website for Session 2 notifications and keep documents such as Aadhaar, Class 10 details, category certificates, and photographs ready in advance. For those who submitted the application but realised errors afterwards, NTA will open a dedicated correction window.

Candidates yet to register for the engineering entrance test can do so by 5 pm tomorrow. The official website to register for JEE Main session 1 is jeemain.nta.nic.in. However, for many candidates who either missed the deadline or made mistakes in their submitted application, the days following the closure of the registration window often bring anxiety and confusion. NTA will be opening the JEE Main application correction window on December 1. For students who could not apply for Session 1, NTA provides some relief. As per the JEE Main cycle, Session 2 registrations will open in early January 2026. This second window allows fresh applicants to register and those registered earlier to attempt the exam again for score improvement. Missing Session 1 does not disqualify a candidate from the exam altogether. In fact, many students prefer appearing only in Session 2 for better preparation time, board exam alignment, or logistical comfort. The scores from either attempt or the best of the two will be considered for admission to NITs, IIITs, GFTIs, and eligibility for JEE Advanced. However, missing Session 1 does mean losing an additional attempt, which could affect confidence and familiarity with the computer-based format.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education.

The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe future of work in India is being dictated by its youngest professionals, but not in the way employers might expect. A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

The Language and Cognition Laboratory, established within the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, is claimed as the first lab in India dedicated to systematically exploring the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.

They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

The draft curriculum, which has been submitted to the NCERT for review, provides a structure for schools to introduce computational thinking and AI in a phased and progressive manner from classes 3 to 12. The curriculum is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which calls for the introduction of “contemporary” subjects like AI, design thinking, and holistic health in the curriculum. Read | Why Indian parents are turning to international boards like IB, Cambridge? For classes 3 to 5, the curriculum recommends that computational thinking — currently a part of the math curriculum in school — be embedded in all subjects such as language, and ‘The World Around Us’, which includes components of environmental studies, science and social science, the sources said. For these classes, assessments on computational thinking will be linked to core subjects that students learn, like math, they added. A similar approach is recommended for classes 6 to 8, where the curriculum suggests incorporating computational thinking into all subjects. At this stage, students are also likely to be introduced to foundational concepts of AI, sources said. From Class 6 onwards, the curriculum suggests assessments like projects, presentations, assignments, and reflective journals.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nThe U.S. immigration system is complex, hard to navigate, and expensive for immigrants. The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms.

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them.

On this week’s Equity, we sat down with Dennis Green-Lieber, the founder of the AI company Propane, to talk about the booming success of the Nordic ecosystem. Green-Lieber is based in Denmark and has been building in the ecosystem for the past 15 years. He chalked up the success of the ecosystem to a few things, including the region’s social safety that lets young people take risks without fear of losing everything. “The newer founders, new generations, are being way more bullish and taking ownership,” he told Equity. “I have not seen, in my 15 years, anything [like] what’s going on right now.” It’s becoming a hub for deep tech and AI, as one report put it, and is now valued at half a trillion dollars, with Nordic startups receiving a little more than $8 billion in venture investments in 2024. The government also plays a part in these companies, providing funding to startups, like Green-Lieber’s, to help founders grow their companies.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nArtificial intelligence startup xAI, founded by Elon Musk, told city and county planners in Memphis last week that it plans to build a solar farm next to its Colossus data center — one of the world’s largest facilities for training AI models. The project would occupy 88 acres to the west and to the south of the data center. A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center’s estimated power use . Musk’s company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NO X pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually.

The project would occupy 88 acres to the west and to the south of the data center. A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center’s estimated power use . Musk’s company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NO X pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually.

But when someone tells you you’re losing your hair, you buy whatever they suggest.” So, he bought the shampoo the hairdresser suggested and left thinking that anyone could sell a man anything by telling him that he’s losing his hair. “Hair loss is such an emotional topic for men and women,” he said. That interaction sent him down a rabbit hole where he discovered how confusing the hair loss industry is, with so much misinformation and clinics with unverified reviews. (He later went to a hair doctor who told him he was, in fact, not balding.) Lefort wanted to create a product that, using AI, would help men diagnose hair loss. Lefort is a serial entrepreneur, having exited one company and currently running two others with Tilen Babnik , who is 28. The duo decided to team up and build a third company: MyHair AI .

The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.

In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion , up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024. Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses. Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious , a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant. “Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch. Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny , SaaS.group , Arising Ventures , and Calm Capital , according to Dumont. “Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said.

The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “ Your Custom Feed .” The new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want. For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future. While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer.

Ahead of Black Friday , Best Buy has offered really solid tech deals on some of our favorite products we've tested and reviewed, ranging from laptops and gaming mice to cordless vacuums. So, whether you're shopping for the perfect gift for that tech lover in your life or if you've been waiting all year for prices to drop on something for yourself, there are a few great options below. For more great discounts, check out our Best Early Black Friday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here . Updated November 26: We've added a Satechi dual dock stand, an iPad, and the Alienware Aurora gaming desktop. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

Sony's top-of-the-line mirrorless camera, the A7R V, is on sale at the lowest price we've ever seen. If you've been thinking of updating, now is the time to buy. The A7R V isn't our top-pick mirrorless camera, but that's mainly because at full price it's expensive relative to the rest of the market. At this price, though, it's a steal, maybe even one of the absolute best Black Friday deals , and while there is no truly best camera for everyone, the A7R V is unquestionably the highest-resolution camera you can buy. And I know, megapixels aren't everything, but I have never taken an image with this camera and thought, darn, that's just too many megapixels. Sony Amazon Adorama B&H Photo The massive 61-megapixel, full-frame sensor in the A7R V is the largest sensor you can get without moving up to a bigger, bulkier medium-format camera. If you want to go totally nuts, get this, landscape photographers: The A7R V can combine 16 shots into a single 240-MP image. It only works with static subjects, but if you ever worried if your images are hi-res enough to cover the side of a building in Times Square, well, you can rest easy with the A7R V. Yes, the megapixel race is silly and mostly over, but I will say that I've shot quite a bit with the A7R C—which uses the same sensor—and images from this 60-MP sensor are noticeable sharper, and the dynamic range is visibly better than what I get from the A7R II (which has a 40-MP sensor). This is obviously the case onscreen, when pixel peeping, but I also notice the difference when I print images. That the A7R V is $900 off does make you wonder if perhaps the A7R VI is on the horizon?

Now newly released satellite images of the targeted KK Park scam center reveal that only buildings in one limited section of the compound were destroyed during the initial raids. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.” High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place.

Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. They also raise concerns about the welfare of thousands of people forced to run scams in KK Park. “The junta is making it sound as though they’re taking down the entire compound, and the imagery that we have seen so far is only limited to one section,” says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization. “It’s important to keep monitoring this to verify what they’re actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they’re actually cracking down on the real problem.” The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings.

Henderson’s TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer’s front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok’s algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson’s November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.) None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose. But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash’s decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer’s personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jeff Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.” “Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.” “Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off.

NASA and Boeing are now targeting no earlier than April 2026 to fly the uncrewed Starliner-1 mission, the space agency said. Launching by next April will require completion of rigorous test, certification, and mission readiness activities, NASA added in a statement . “NASA and Boeing are continuing to rigorously test the Starliner propulsion system in preparation for two potential flights next year,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, in a statement. NASA also said it has reached an agreement with Boeing to modify the Commercial Crew contract, signed in 2014, that called for six crewed flights to the space station following certification of the spacecraft. Now the plan is to fly Starliner-1 carrying cargo and then up to three additional missions before the space station is retired. “This modification allows NASA and Boeing to focus on safely certifying the system in 2026, execute Starliner’s first crew rotation when ready, and align our ongoing flight planning for future Starliner missions based on station’s operational needs through 2030,” Stich said. SpaceX and Boeing were both awarded contracts in 2014 to develop crewed spacecraft and fly six operational missions to the space station. SpaceX, with its Crew Dragon vehicle, flew a successful crew test flight in mid-2020 and its first operational mission before the end of that year.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nICICI Securitie's research report on HDFC Bank Post the merger, the bank has seen structural changes to the balance sheet in the form of sharp rise in LDR, lower CASA share and significant rise in the share of borrowing. The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

The initiative aims to strengthen France’s domestic defense capabilities in response to “accelerating threats” on the global stage. “France cannot remain idle,” Macron said during a speech at the 27th Mountain Infantry Brigade in Varces, in the French Alps. “This program is inspired by practices of our European partners … at a time when all our European allies advance in response to a threat that weighs on us all.” The voluntary program will target 18- and 19-year-olds, offering a 10-month service on French soil, with participants receiving pay. The initiative is budgeted at 2 billion euros ($2.32 billion). Macron outlined the scale of the program: -3,000 participants in 2026 -10,000 participants by 2030 -Ambition to reach 50,000 youth by 2035, depending on evolving threats After completing the program, participants may integrate into civilian life, join as reservists, or continue in the armed forces. Macron emphasized that the new program will not involve mandatory service, affirming the decision of former President Jacques Chirac to scrap conscription in 1996. “We cannot return to the time of conscription,” Macron said. “This hybrid army model corresponds to the threats and risks ahead, bringing together national service youth, reservists, and the active army.” The French military aims to increase its reserve force to 100,000 by 2030, up from the current 47,000, bringing the total military force to approximately 210,000. Poll data cited by Macron’s aides suggests strong backing for the armed forces among 18- to 25-year-olds, reinforcing the timing of the initiative.

Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the apex direct tax policy-making body, said on Thursday that it will send text messages and emails to identified taxpayers, advising them to voluntarily review and revise their tax returns before the end of December to avoid penalties.

The first such campaign, launched in November 2024, targeted select taxpayers who were flagged by foreign tax jurisdictions as asset holders but had not disclosed the same in their income tax returns in India for the assessment year 2024-25. “The initiative yielded positive outcomes, with 24,678 taxpayers (including several not directly nudged) revisiting their returns and disclosing foreign assets amounting to ₹ 29,208 crore, along with foreign-source income of ₹ 1,089.88 crore,” CBDT said.

The first such campaign, launched in November 2024, targeted select taxpayers who were flagged by foreign tax jurisdictions as asset holders but had not disclosed the same in their income tax returns in India for the assessment year 2024-25. “The initiative yielded positive outcomes, with 24,678 taxpayers (including several not directly nudged) revisiting their returns and disclosing foreign assets amounting to ₹ 29,208 crore, along with foreign-source income of ₹ 1,089.88 crore,” CBDT said. Under the law, those who have not disclosed their foreign income and assets on their income tax return have until the end of December to revise their tax returns. Assessees are required to disclose foreign assets and income, as well as any tax relief claimed under the double tax avoidance agreement between India and the country in which the assets are located. The tax authority will initially select about 25,000 high-risk cases and reach out to them, a person familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. The CBDT found that certain high-risk cases, where foreign assets appear to exist, have not been reported in the income ta"}

The image is impossible to erase from my mind.” As hundreds of firefighters began battling to contain the inferno, residents trapped in the buildings made desperate calls to emergency services.

The image is impossible to erase from my mind.” As hundreds of firefighters began battling to contain the inferno, residents trapped in the buildings made desperate calls to emergency services. Others begged for their pets to be saved. Yet the intense heat meant rescue workers were unable to enter some of the buildings as flames continued to travel upward. At 6:22 p.m., the government raised the fire alarm to the maximum No. 5 level for the first time in 17 years. The fires burned relentlessly through the night, consuming each floor in turn. As of Thursday morning, firefighters had managed to extinguish the flames in four of the seven buildings that caught fire.

While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply.
