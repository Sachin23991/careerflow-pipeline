{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nIndian students and workers accounted for the largest share of visa-holders leaving the United Kingdom this year, according to the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWith the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) venturing into offering undergraduate programmes like those in management studies, data science, and economics, IIM Kozhikode Director Debashis Chatterjee spoke to The Indian Express about branching out from the traditional postgraduate programmes in management that the IIMs have been known for so far. IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n–Ankit Mehra For decades, the United States has been considered the world’s most desirable higher education destination, especially in STEM fields. It powered the ambitions of Indian students chasing world-class education, research excellence and global careers. Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC).

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\n— Siddharth Garg There is a widely believed misconception amongst students and parents, that if a student prepares rigorously for the Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), they will have to give up their preparation for the board exams . There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nResearchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras , have identified measurable physiological indicators that can help pinpoint students most vulnerable to test anxiety, paving the way for new, targeted interventions that could revolutionise how educational systems approach stress and performance, according to officials. The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

The startups building the infrastructure behind them are cashing in too. Supabase, the open-source database platform that’s become the backend of choice for the vibe-coding world, raised $100 million at a $5 billion valuation just months after closing $200 million at $2 billion. But co-founder and CEO Paul Copplestone has a surprising strategy: he keeps turning down million-dollar enterprise contracts from deep-pocketed but demanding customers. He’s betting instead that if he sticks to his own product vision, the world will come to him. So far, he’s been right. Today on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Julie Bort sat down with Copplestone to explore Supabase’s rise and what it means for vibe coding, developers and the database giants who have historically controlled this market.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever.

Everything on this list has been hands-on tested by a member of our Reviews team and is recommended as worth the money at full price. But you won't pay full price, as all these items are also actually cheaper than you'll find them the rest of the year.

The resolution is 2560 by 1600, with decent color accuracy and brightness. The battery life is downright impressive. And the touchpad, which is an area where many budget laptops compromise, actually feels smooth and responsive. This is something no other Windows laptop can pull off. The only catch is that it’s a Doorbuster-style sale on Dell's own site, meaning once they sell out at this price, this discount will disappear. —Luke Larsen Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) The Surface Laptop is the MacBook of the Windows world, and the seventh edition has a brilliant display and great battery life.

There are a lot of decent options out there, but when it comes to the best bang-for-your-buck value, this $300 off sale on the Alienware 16X Aurora has to be the best. It's the closest laptop with an Nvidia RTX 5060 graphics card that I've seen get to $1,000. For $1,100, you get 16 GB of RAM, 1 TB of storage, and the aforementioned RTX 5060. In contrast, another gaming laptop I love , the Razer Blade 14, has an RTX 5060 configuration on sale for $1,450. Similar specs for a lot more money.

The difference in price between the two machines is only $100, which doesn't sound like a huge difference, but the Alienware 16X Aurora also comes with a higher-resolution, 2560 x 1600 display. That goes a long way toward making the laptop feel more premium, especially outside of your gaming sessions. With an RTX 5060, you probably won't do a whole lot of gaming at native resolution, but if you also want to use your laptop for watching videos, studying, or work, the sharper display of the Alienware laptop is a nice upgrade.

In May 2014, NASA announced at a press conference that a portion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appeared to have reached a point of irreversible retreat. Glaciers flowing toward the sea at the periphery of the 2-kilometer-thick sheet of ice were losing ice faster than snowfall could replenish them, causing their edges to recede inland. With that, the question was no longer whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet would disappear, but when. When those glaciers go, sea levels will rise by more than a meter, inundating land currently inhabited by 230 million people . And that would be just the first act before the collapse of the entire ice sheet, which could raise seas 5 meters and redraw the world’s coastlines. At the time, scientists assumed that the loss of those glaciers would unfold over centuries. But in 2016, a bombshell study in Nature concluded that crumbling ice cliffs could trigger a runaway process of retreat, dramatically hastening the timeline. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) took notice, establishing a sobering new worst-case scenario: By 2100, meltwater from Antarctica, Greenland, and mountain glaciers combined with the thermal expansion of seawater could raise global sea levels by over 2 meters . And that would only be the beginning. If greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated, seas would rise a staggering 15 meters by 2300. However, not all scientists are convinced by the runaway scenario. Thus, a tension has emerged over how long we have until West Antarctica’s huge glaciers vanish. If their retreat unfolds over centuries, humanity may have time to adapt. But if rapid destabilization begins in the coming decades through the controversial runaway process, the consequences could outpace our ability to respond.

The branches are nice and thick, but it is a little harder to hang ornaments around the flocking. National Tree Company National Tree Company (Unlit) Out of all the trees we tested, not only is this the cheapest one we liked, but it was rated easiest artificial Christmas tree to fluff thanks to its pliable branches.

Studies have repeatedly shown that people with vulvas need clitoral stimulation to orgasm, but it wasn’t until 2014 that the first clitoral suction toy hit the market. These days, many suction toys (also called clit suckers) have been designed by the people using them. That's how it should be. I've tested dozens of suction toys solo and during partner play with people of various gender identities, genitals, and sexual desires.

Clitoral suction toys can be a bit of a mystery if you're unfamiliar with their ins and outs. Vibrators have motors that deliver vibrations for stimulation, but a suction toy is a little more complex. They work by modulating air pressure with an internal diaphragm. They all have a mouthpiece, and inside that mouthpiece is a (typically) silicone membrane that an internal motor moves in and out. When you press the mouthpiece against your body, it traps the air, keeping it from escaping. The movement of the membrane uses that air to create modulating high and low air pressure.

Updated November 29: We've added deals on the LED Esthetics GloTech Collar, Tepenar Hair Dryer Bonnet Attachment, Drybar's Double Shot Oval Blow Dryer Brush, and its Prep Rally Prime & Prep Detangler. We also vetted prices. CurrentBody CurrentBody While we haven’t tested the Green Tea Serum or Hydrogel Face Mask (both included in this bundle), this offer is too good to pass up. The standout here is the LED Series 2, which alone retails for $470 (and is not on sale), making this deal $48 less than the mask alone. In other words, it’s a steal even if you don’t plan to use the accompanying products. The LED Series 2 is the best red light therapy mask on the market. Crafted from medical-grade silicone, it hugs your face with 236 bulbs, ensuring direct contact. It delivers three wavelengths—red (633 nanometers), near-infrared (830 nanometers), and deep near-infrared (1072 nanometers)—to target skin rejuvenation at multiple depths. I’d recommend this splurge to people who’d like to target fine lines, wrinkles, or sun damage. Reviewer Nena Farrell also noted visible improvements in her acne scarring.

Rather than upgrading your wearable every few years, Whoop offers its screenless wristband for free with a monthly subscription that allows you to get the latest software updates as they arrive. This model did not work so well for a few years when Whoop released very few updates of any kind, software- or hardware-related. But this year, Whoop debuted two new models, the Whoop 5.0 and the Whoop MG (8/10, WIRED Recommends) . Until December 2, Whoop's two top-tier subscriptions are discounted, along with up to 70 percent off new Whoop bands . Whoop Whoop (One) Whoop (Peak) Whoop (Life) Best Black Friday Home and Beauty Deals (2025) Explore the story Before this year, Whoop charged a blanket $30 per month for all its features, which include Whoop's proprietary Strain score. This is a measurement based on the Borg scale of exertion, which is why I noted that it's the best fitness tracker for gym bros —it measures how hard you work at every activity, not how much activity you engage in per day. Strolled around for 20,000 steps? No good! Get back into the gym and do some lifting! Right now, the Whoop 5.0 Peak Plan is $40 off the 12-month subscription ($199), which includes the 5.0 with the new Healthspan and Pace of Aging features. The Whoop Life ($359/year, now $299) gets you the Whoop MG, which unlocks cardiac features like ECGs, heart screeners, blood pressure monitoring, and AFib detection. Paywalling the best and most interesting features behind a subscription does suck, but the current Whoop Life subscription costs the same as the original sub, so it's not actually a price hike (and discounted, it's much cheaper).

In fact, in recent years, some of the most high-profile and brazen digital attacks around the world have been carried out by teens.

Protecting your digital privacy isn't a blanket prescription. Some people are more private by nature, and others prioritize putting themselves out there. But even if you're a 24/7 streamer, you can still think about your operations security, commonly known as opsec. What can viewers see in your room while you're streaming? Which people from your life have appeared onscreen? Could viewers figure out where you live from what they can see out your window?

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY.

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring.

Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

Trump captioned his post, “Winning is always nice!” The clip was posted shortly after Trump again mocked former President Joe Biden ’s golf abilities during a Thanksgiving call with US military personnel.

That was the only thing that made me angry.” Trump reminded the service members of Biden’s backtracking during the 2024 debate: “He said he was a six… Then he said, ‘Well, I’m an eight.’ I said, ‘That was quick.’” Trump went on to list his own achievements on the course, touting the experience he often mentions publicly. “I’ve won 38 club championships, and I don’t get to practice much,” Trump said.

The tech entrepreneur expressed optimism about expanding Starlink operations to India , which would mark a significant step in the company’s goal of connecting underserved regions globally.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nTech entrepreneur Elon Musk has predicted that rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics could make work optional within the next 10 to 20 years. Musk’s vision underscores a future where human labor may no longer be a necessity for survival, with automation and AI potentially reshaping global economies and societal structures. Musk , during a conversation with Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath on People by WTF podcast, released on Sunday (November 30), said, “My prediction is that, in the future, working will be optional. People can play this back in 20 years and say it was wrong, but I think it will be correct. In less than 20 years, maybe even 10 or 15, advances in AI and robotics will bring us to a point where working is optional.” To illustrate his vision, Musk compared future work to the choice of growing vegetables at home versus buying them from a store. “In the same way that you can grow your own vegetables or go to a shop and buy them, it’s much harder to grow your own. Some people enjoy it, which is fine. But it is optional—that is how I see work in the future,” he said. Musk further noted that technological advances could make goods and services readily available to everyone. “I’m confident that if AI and robotics continue to advance—and they are advancing very fast—working will be optional, and people will have any goods and services they want. If you can think of it, you can have it,” he said. Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news. Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment. Oops!

It’s not unanimous,” he said. He criticised the Biden administration’s approach: “Under the Biden administration, it was basically a total free-for-all with no border controls… You had massive amounts of illegal immigration.” He argued that generous government benefits create “a diffusion gradient” drawing more undocumented migrants.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nJabalpur: RSS-linked Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) on Sunday rejected Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind (JUH) president Maulana Mahmood Madani's claim that the minority community feels unsafe in India, saying \"separatist-minded clerics\" like him hindered the progress of Muslims. The MRM's national convenor, S K Muddin, in a statement, said Muslims enjoy full Constitutional rights and security in the country. Madani had on Saturday alleged that efforts were being made in the country to establish the supremacy of one group through actions like bulldozer action, mob lynching, weakening of the Muslim Waqf and Islamic reforms. He also claimed that the perception that courts were working under government pressure had grown following the Babri Masjid verdict and many other decisions. Reacting to the remarks, Muddin, the former chairman of the MP Madarsa Board, said that Muslims were \"most secure\" in India compared to any other country and described the country as \"riot-free\" today.

Speaking to PTI, Chandran noted that India is undergoing a “rapid demographic transition”, with birth rate set to drop sharply over the past 20 years. He added, “In 2000, our TFR was 3.5 and today it stands at 1.9. This is a drastic decline.” TFR is the total fertility rate. According to Chandran, all estimates show India's maximum population will remain below 2 billion and expected to peak around 1.8-1.9 billion by 2080 when growth stabilises. According to the official, the fall in fertility rate is “primarily” due to increased development and education levels. “Increased female literacy has directly shaped decisions around marriage and childbearing, leading to smaller families. Greater use of contraceptives and wider access to birth control have further accelerated the decline,” he said. “Couples today are better informed and exercise greater control over when and how many children to have,” Chandran added. He further added that many are opting to marry later in life and choosing to grow economic opportunities, especially women are increasingly pursuing careers , which also has significantly influence on reproductive choices. Chandran noted that increased development has a direct impact on fertility. “Development is inversely proportional to birth rates . Illiterate groups still have fertility levels above three, but among the educated, TFR ranges between 1.5 and 1.8,” he said. He cited Kerala as an example, noting that the achieved replacement-level fertility (2.1) between 1987 and 1989 and now has a TFR of around 1.5.

{"prompt": "Summarize and explain this career-related news for students:\n\nWith long commutes, irregular sleep and constant stress becoming a part of modern life, many early signs of heart trouble often get brushed aside as exhaustion or acidity. But a US-based cardiologist is warning that these everyday discomforts could be the body signaling a silent heart attack risk — and timely attention can save lives. In a recent Instagram post, Arizona-based cardiologist Dr Jack Wolfson — with more than 16 years of clinical experience — highlighted five little-known symptoms that should not be ignored. “Everyone knows the classic signs of a heart attack,” he wrote, “but here are five you’ve probably never heard of — and they could save your life.” Dry, flaky or itchy skin, unexplained rashes and conditions like eczema can indicate inflammation in the body. According to Dr Wolfson, that internal “burning” — caused by inflammation and oxidative stress — is closely linked to a higher risk of heart disease and heart attacks. “Headaches are not normal,” he emphasised. They may point to issues with blood vessels or low nitric oxide levels — both red flags for cardiovascular strain. Persistent headaches should be checked, he says. Constipation, nausea, stomach bloating or ongoing abdominal pain could be tied to heart health. “The heart and the gut are intimately connected,” Dr Wolfson noted, urging people not to dismiss digestive woes as routine problems. Generalised aches — including tooth pain, shoulder pain or discomfort between the shoulder blades — can sometimes accompany a heart attack, especially in cases where chest pain isn’t prominent. “Any kind of pain anywhere could suggest inflammation,” he warned, linking it to elevated risks of heart attack and stroke. Broken sleep, night-time wakeups or chronic insomnia may also point to cardiovascular stress. “If you have sleep issues… these things are linked to increased heart attack risk,” he cautioned. “Your body whispers before it screams out in pain.” Early recognition and timely medical care remain \n\nAnswer:", "completion": " With long commutes, irregular sleep and constant stress becoming a part of modern life, many early signs of heart trouble often get brushed aside as exhaustion or acidity.
