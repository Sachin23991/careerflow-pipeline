IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause.

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

IIE, a not-for-profit headquartered in New York, Monday released a fall 2025 snapshot survey on international student enrolment at 825 higher education institutions in the US.

In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764145247.8022475}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations.

In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion , up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024. Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses. Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant. “Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch. Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny , SaaS.group , Arising Ventures , and Calm Capital , according to Dumont. “Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said. In 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment. Since then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel. “It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it.

The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “ Your Custom Feed .” The new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want. For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests. Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future. While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options. YouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature.

The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all. “Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.” Interactive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted.

Another said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.” It remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots.

WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.” WMG also announced that it has sold Songkick , a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business. WMG says Songkick will continue as a fan destination under Suno. As a result of WMG’s partnership, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models that will replace its current ones next year. Downloading audio from the service will require a paid account, while users on the free tier will be limited to playing and sharing songs made on the platform. WMG’s artists and songwriters will also have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices, and compositions are used in new AI-generated music. Artists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more. “This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.” The news comes a week after WMG settled its copyright lawsuit with AI music startup Udio and entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026. WMG’s settlements with Suno and Udio mark a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI.

The tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point. Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season, which could be a boon for AI shopping startups like Phia , Cherry , or Deft (rebranded as Onton) — but with OpenAI and Perplexity pushing further into AI shopping experiences, are these startups in danger? Zach Hudson, CEO of the interior design shopping tool Onton , thinks that AI shopping startups with a specialized niche will still provide a better experience to users than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. “Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources,” Hudson told TechCrunch. “Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google. That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.” Daydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she remarked to TechCrunch over the summer that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well. “Fashion … is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/openai-and-perplexity-are-launching-ai-shopping-assistants-but-competing-startups-arent-sweating-it/", "timestamp": 1764145549.025168}

Now he’s empowering young people to pursue their passions through his career exploration platform, Find Your Grind . The platform highlights alternative professions not usually emphasized in schools, including being a pop-punk band member, content creator, social media manager, and even a professional esports player. The company announced on Tuesday a $5 million Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $8 million. The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm, Gross Labs. The investment will help expand the company’s “career readiness” programs across the U.S. Gross began his music career at 17 when his high school band, Open Air Stereo, gained significant exposure after being featured on MTV’s hit reality series “Laguna Beach.” Inspired by his experience, Gross came up with the idea for Find Your Grind after bringing students into his studio and seeing firsthand the challenges they face when exploring career options, often due to a lack of exposure in traditional schools. “Young people are entering a rapidly changing world of work,” Gross told TechCrunch. “As students prepare to leave school and enter into their professional careers, many are doing so without a strong sense of who they are, what they want, or how to navigate their next steps after school. Find Your Grind gives them the tools to explore not just what careers are out there, but what paths suit their strengths, interests, and visions for what they want their futures to look like,” he said. Conventional career guidance often focuses on salaries and promotions, but this can feel disconnected from the rapidly evolving job market that the new generation is entering.

After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web . The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.

The company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report. Pony.ai, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber. The ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period. Shares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report. Pony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees. The company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024.

The startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours. The Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide.

Just like other dictation tools, Speechify’s voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words. In my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify’s tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well.

The startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.” While ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center. “We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday, more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020 . It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery.

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless ” and pocket-sized . Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io , to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco. Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes. “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.

Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads. Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times. FSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.

Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko , is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “ An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own .” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox , I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.

We know how important your tech purchases are (duh, we’re WIRED) and we have a OnePlus promo code to help you save. OnePlus Black Friday sales promise hundreds of dollars and huge savings on some of our favorite WIRED-tested tech. This means slashed prices, like the OnePlus 13 for $700 ($200 off), the OnePlus Watch 3 for $250 ($100 off), and the OnePlus 12 for $900. On November 13, the anticipated OnePlus 15 is launching, with new buzz-worthy features and improvements on the already-polished tech from techy fan favorite, OnePlus. It’s true what they say: the early bird gets the worm. When you subscribe today for OnePlus newsletters and information about the latest drops, you can get $50 off or a chance to win the OnePlus Pad 3 for free. And, if you decide on the OnePlus 13 instead, you can get a Black Eclipse12 GB RAM with 256 GB ROM for $900, and get a free gift with purchase. As mentioned, we at WIRED love OnePlus because of the affordable price point while maintaining solid quality. The newest iteration of the OnePlus 12 impressed us. One of the biggest drawbacks in previous models was the camera quality, but OnePlus has done a lot of work to improve it in the past few years and it’s now on level with competitors like Samsung. Our senior reviews editor and tech overlord Julian Chokkattu called the newest iteration a “Very Good Phone” (high praise from him). It also charges with blazing speed.

From the constant 4:20 references to his quote tweet “dunks” to awarding “ Certified Bangers ” badges to silly X posts, Musk’s desperation for validation knows no bounds. It can get pretty annoying when the richest guy on earth makes a joke and then awkwardly eyes the room waiting for everyone to laugh. But over the weekend, I was intrigued when a clip emerged of Musk telling Joe Rogan that using Grok’s Unhinged Mode to deliver an “epic vulgar roast” is a surefire way to “make people really laugh at a party.” “Point the camera at them, and now do a vulgar roast of this person … then keep saying, ‘no, no, make it even more vulgar. Use forbidden words,’” Musk excitedly tells Rogan in the clip taken from their three-hour-plus conversation published on Rogan’s podcast in October. “Eventually it's like, holy fuck, you know. I mean it’s trying to jam a rocket up your ass and have it explode. It’s next level. Beyond fucking belief,” he continues, chuckling and even raising his arms above his head at the mere thought. The best roast jokes tend to be smart, reflect a familiarity with the person being roasted, and contain just the right amount of mean. It’s not a task one would think a large language model would be great at. But, with Thanksgiving and holiday season on the horizon, I figured why not test Musk’s claim that Grok can deliver a foul-mouthed razz with the best of them? I gave it a test spin at the office by turning Grok loose on my colleagues. (I do not recommend anyone else do this at work.) Three of my coworkers and I set up shop in my boss’s office so I could privately undertake the embarrassing task of telling Grok to roast all of us one by one.

Late last month, the Intercept reported that ICE intends to hire bounty hunters and private investigators for street-level verification work. Contractors would confirm home and work addresses for people targeted for removal by—among other techniques—photographing residences, documenting comings and goings, and staking out workplaces and apartment complexes. Those filings cast the initiative as a substantial but limited pilot program. Contractors were guaranteed as little as $250 and could earn no more than $90 million each, with the overall program capped at $180 million. That structure pointed to meaningful scale but still framed the effort as a controlled trial, not an integral component of ICE’s removal operations. Newly released amendments dismantle that structure. ICE has removed the program’s spending cap and replaced it with dramatically higher per-vendor limits. Contractors may now earn up to $281.25 million individually and are guaranteed an initial task order worth at least $7.5 million. The shift signals to ICE’s contracting base that this is no longer an experiment, but an investment, and that the agency expects prime-tier contractors to stand up the staffing, technology, and field operations needed to function as a de facto arm of federal enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. The proposed scope was already large. It described contractors receiving monthly recurring batches of 50,000 cases drawn from a docket of 1.5 million people.

If you just want a simple, big-screen tablet to catch up on shows, do some work, and even play games, the iPad A16 fits the bill.

After all, some people want a simpler entry into the world of PC gaming that doesn't involve tinkering. That's where a PC like the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes into play—in theory. While Alienware typically addresses the higher-end demographic with its gaming desktops and laptops, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is the company's most serious attempt yet to offer its gaming goods at a lower price. Overall, I've been happy with what you get with the Aurora, especially when I've seen sales that dip the price to $1,500. I recently reviewed the Dell Tower Plus , a prebuilt desktop I liked quite a lot. Turns out, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is almost identical to that PC, but with the Alienware branding (Dell owns Alienware). You get a ring of Tron -esque light around the intake fans at the front, as well as the smattering of honeycomb perforations along the glass window in the side panel. And the alien head itself is the power button. Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop Rating: 7/10 It’s accurate to say that the Aurora feels like a gamer skin on the Dell Tower Plus, but that’s not a complaint. I found a lot to like about the way Dell balanced ease of use, upgradability, and price—and it translates well enough for gaming hardware. It’s not using fully off-the-shelf parts, but there’s enough here to make specific upgrades well into the future. Like the Dell Tower Plus, the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes in a custom case with an Intel Z890 Alienware motherboard, which has two DIMM slots of memory and two PCIe 5 M.2 slots for SSDs. Even though a standard ATX or Micro-ATX motherboard would fit, swapping in a new one would be difficult due to the use of proprietary connectors. An AMD CPU is a better option for prebuilt desktops like this, as you might be able to upgrade in future generations because AMD supports the same socket in a way that Intel does not.

They're all controlled through the Nothing app, which is available for both iOS and Android. Sound quality is excellent, partially thanks to a collaboration with British speaker maker KEF , and these 40-mm drivers have excellent low-mid performance that gives them a unique pop. The soundstage isn't quite as expansive as some of the very best, but it gets most of the way there without costing nearly as much.

They can listen to tunes while playing, share their favorites with friends, and hold dance parties in their bedrooms. Stories and podcasts will take them to new worlds, both real and imagined. And when it’s time for bed, they can drift off to soothing sleep sounds, lullabies, or sleep stories. I've tried a string of different speakers with my kids over the years and found them fun, helpful, and a great way to cut down on screen time. These are our favorites.

How to Keep Your Kid Safe Online There’s an element of risk with any device that can connect to the internet, so take the time to configure your child’s speaker and ensure that any related accounts are secure. Discuss rules : Talk with your children to agree on rules about what they can use their speaker for, and, for smart speakers , how they should speak to it. Secure your accounts and network : Make sure you select strong, unique passwords for your devices and Wi-Fi network, using a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. Always use two-factor authentication (2FA) where available (here’s how to activate 2FA on your Amazon account ). Use parental controls : You can set up parental controls with Apple, Google, and Microsoft accounts , and use them to lock down various devices , including speakers. You may also have parental controls on your router or mesh that enable you to schedule downtime for your child’s devices, so they can’t access the internet in the middle of the night, for example. Consider privacy : You might want to limit how voice recordings from your child’s speaker can be used.

That's at least part of the reasoning behind the existence of the LG UltraFine Evo 6K. This 32-inch monitor aims to put even more pixels in front of content creators and professionals. Beyond that, it has an attention-grabbing design and off-the-charts image quality. It's one of the best monitors you can buy for content creators, despite some of the unfortunate trade-offs it comes with. The 32-inch LG UltraFine Evo 6K is a very pretty monitor. I wouldn't blame you for mistaking this as an Apple product, given the focus on clean lines, simple shapes, and designerly aesthetic. The extra-wide stand means that the base itself isn’t overly large. Like the Apple Studio Display , the flat base provides more usable desk space rather than occupying it. The stand itself has a unique design, too. It resembles the styling Apple uses on the iMac and Studio Display, but it has a textured pattern on the back. It’s gorgeous, though you probably won’t spend a lot of time looking at the back of the monitor unless your desk is in the middle of the room or in command position (if you know, you know). LG UltraFine Evo 6K Monitor Rating: 7/10 I also like that the back of the cabinet is flat, giving it a sleek look that the rounded backs of typical monitors can’t achieve. Because it uses conventional backlighting, though, it’s not as thin as OLED displays like some of Samsung’s Odyssey gaming monitors . The UltraFine 6K also has some impressively thin bezels, too, adding to the ultra-modern aesthetic. While they’re not “virtually borderless” as LG states, they’re smaller than the bezels on most monitors I’ve tested. One of my favorite aspects of the UltraFine Evo 6K is the speakers. The pair of included speakers on this might be the best I've heard on a monitor. They are extremely loud and clear. There's even a decent amount of bass in there, to the point where you won't need a pair of computer speakers .

While doing so, Coleman singled out the work of one self-described “predator hunter” who claims to have helped identify alleged abusers mixing with young gamers. “Roblox is even trying to silence those who raised these security risks,” Coleman said. “The famous case of one of their developers, Schlep, immediately comes to mind.” Schlep is in fact Michael, a 22-year-old Texan who has spent the last two years working with a group of other Roblox players to track down and identify people purportedly seeking to groom young children on the platform—predators like the one Schlep says allegedly groomed him a decade ago, which he says led him to try to take his own life. In the process of attempting to out suspected groomers, Schlep—who doesn’t share his surname for privacy reasons—has amassed 2.3 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he highlights what he believes to be the shortcomings of Roblox’s safety features and reveals the identities of the alleged predators he has tracked down. But on August 8, Schlep received a cease-and-desist letter from Roblox, and instantly, all of his accounts were banned. His predator hunter days were over. “While Roblox acknowledges that your stated intentions may be to protect children, and while it recognizes the serious nature of online predatory behavior, your methods, including failing to immediately report suspicious activity to Roblox through proper channels, are actively interfering with Roblox’s established safety protocols and, critically, are exposing Roblox’s users to increased risk,” the company wrote in the letter reviewed by WIRED.

This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance. Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane , chaga , and cordyceps —boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, including our top pick, Atlas Coffee Club’s Latte Superblend ($26) , swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging.

It simply read, “gm”—internet slang for “good morning.” The account has been posting consistently since. Bankman-Fried—known widely as SBF—is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence in California. In November 2023, he was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy by a jury in the Southern District of New York over his role in the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Immediately after his sentencing, Bankman-Fried signaled his intention to appeal . In spring, he spoke to a handful of reporters from prison. But otherwise, he has largely receded from public view. Distracted by the arrival of US bitcoin exchange-traded funds , a memecoin goldrush , talk of national bitcoin reserves , and the prospect of an easy ride under US president Donald Trump, the crypto industry moved on too. However, since September, Bankman-Fried’s X account has been causing a stir . (Though Bankman-Fried does not have access to the internet in prison, a friend is supposedly posting on his behalf .) The posts lob criticism at the administrators of the FTX bankruptcy estate and focus on alleged misconceptions about the condition of FTX’s finances when it fell; they claim that the money was never missing, only stuck in illiquid assets. From prison, Bankman-Fried has also been sitting for interviews with media outlet Mother Jones, published in October, during which he largely promoted the same perspective. His mother, the legal professor Barbara Fried, recently launched a Substack . Her first and only post, published in late October, is a 65-page treatise entitled “The Trial of Sam Bankman-Fried,” in which she makes the case that her son neither committed a fraud nor received a fair trial.

Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works.

Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability.

Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly due to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs in terms of connectivity or resolution. Analogue 3D Rating: 9/10 Enter, then, the Analogue3D, the latest console from the makers of the Analogue Pocket . Like its portable predecessor, this is a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) piece of kit that perfectly mimics the original console, allowing you to play authentic game carts without emulation. It goes beyond being a third-party remake though—it runs those games better than ever thanks to a baked-in virtualized Expansion Pak and the ability to overclock, beautifully presenting games with a host of display options, and outputting it all in glorious 4K. Throw in universal support for N64 carts and accessories from anywhere in the world, meaning the region lockouts of the '90s are literally a thing of the past, and this might just be my favorite \"new\" console of 2025. At a glance, you may just mistake the Analogue3D for the real thing, especially the black model (it's also available", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/analogue3d-console/", "timestamp": 1764145561.1093836}

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet cofounded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him. Nnormal Backcountry Nnormal Nnormal's aim is to institute sustainable practices into manufacturing gear. “Probably the most important system is the most complicated,” Jornet said. “It's very costly to be constantly rotating things … how can we have [a company] that's not based on overconsumption?” The solution was to create incredibly durable running shoes that only have to be swapped out every two to four years.

As soon as I got my hands on a joystick and mashed a few buttons, I was hooked. While home arcade machines will never compete with a fully fledged arcade, good arcades are few and far between nowadays, unless you can manage a trip to Tokyo .

Updated November 2025: We added the G'AIM'E Time Crisis Premium Light Gun, dimensions for each cabinet, and updated prices. Are Home Arcade Machines Worth It? Most home arcade machines are at least as expensive as the latest game consoles, sometimes far more expensive. They usually come with several games included, but they are still a considerable investment, so think carefully before you buy. Don’t get hung up on how many titles are included. It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal.

This means that security teams at tech companies have more code than ever to review while dealing with even more pressure from bad actors. On Monday, Amazon will publish details for the first time of an internal system known as Autonomous Threat Analysis (ATA), which the company has been using to help its security teams proactively identify weaknesses in its platforms, perform variant analysis to quickly search for other, similar flaws, and then develop remediations and detection capabilities to plug holes before attackers find them. ATA was born out of an internal Amazon hackathon in August 2024, and security team members say that it has grown into a crucial tool since then. The key concept underlying ATA is that it isn't a single AI agent developed to comprehensively conduct security testing and threat analysis. Instead, Amazon developed multiple specialized AI agents that compete against each other in two teams to rapidly investigate real attack techniques and different ways they could be used against Amazon's systems—and then propose security controls for human review. “The initial concept was aimed to address a critical limitation in security testing—limited coverage and the challenge of keeping detection capabilities current in a rapidly evolving threat landscape,\" Steve Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, tells WIRED. “Limited coverage means you can’t get through all of the software or you can’t get to all of the applications because you just don’t have enough humans. And then it’s great to do an analysis of a set of software, but if you don’t keep the detection systems themselves up to date with the changes in the threat landscape, you’re missing half of the picture.” As part of scaling its use of ATA, Amazon developed special “high-fidelity” testing environments that are deeply real", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-autonomous-threat-analysis/", "timestamp": 1764145562.6266496}

Thanks to pandemics and wildfires, air purifiers have become the gotta-have-it home appliance. Buildings let in a lot of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and vaporous chemicals. Indoor plastics, furniture, paint, and flooring off-gas noxious fumes , too. Since your home might be your workplace , playground, meditation studio , dine-in restaurant, and movie theater , you want to ensure that the air you’re breathing for most of the day is clean. These are our best air purifiers—from the top-of-the-line IQ Air Atem X ($1,400) to the more affordable Coway Airmega Mighty ($230) and everything in between. Trends in air purifier design favor both the cylindrical tower models, along with boxier designs, washable fabric covers, and dual-purpose air purifiers that not only clean the air but also work as electric dustpans, humidifiers, nightlights, sunrise alarms, and tables. For more home tips, take a peek at our other guides, including the Best Space Heaters , Best Robot Vacuums , Best Cordless Vacuums , and the Best Mesh Wi-Fi Routers .

If you have the means, the Atem X truly is the best investment when it comes to a HEPA filter. Aside from its sleek design, there's an option for a 10-year warranty (with registration and filter subscription), which means you’ll have access to parts and repairs for a decade. It’s quiet and has custom settings, a built-in sensor, and a dashboard phone app, and it can be set flush against a wall.

Check out our guides to the best backpacking tents and best car camping tents for more details. Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. It's not without its quirks ( read the pitching tips ), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat. It's well ventilated for a single-walled tent, with the ability to raise up the front door when weather is nice. I also like that it only needs one trekking pole (or one pole if you don't hike with trekking poles). You'd be hard-pressed to find a tent even half this nice at this price. The Copper Spur UL 2 is currently our top pick for lightweight freestanding backpacking tents , and it's been a popular choice with readers for years. This is a high-quality, well-designed tent that's lightweight, easy to set up, and roomy enough to be livable in the backcountry.

Apple’s MagSafe technology opens up so many possibilities in the smartphone accessory world, and even more so with the release of Qi2 Android devices. With the built-in magnets, you can attach your iPhone to wireless chargers , car mounts , grips , and even tripods by simply snapping it in place. But wallets may be the most useful MagSafe accessories of them all. The best MagSafe wallets let you attach a sleek, compact, and slim wallet to your iPhone (or MagSafe-compatible case ) instead of carrying a bulky traditional wallet. It's great for anyone who travels light and only carries a few cards at a time. We've tested dozens, and these are the best. Read our MagSafe guides for more, including the Best MagSafe Accessories , Best MagSafe Power Banks , Best MagSafe Wireless Chargers , Best MagSafe Grips , and Best iPhone 17 Cases . Updated November 2025: We've added the ESR Geo wallet, Satechi Vegan Leather wallet, and Moft Snap Field wallet. What Is MagSafe? MagSafe is Apple's magnetic technology built into the iPhone 12 , iPhone 13 , iPhone 14 , iPhone 15 , iPhone 16 , and iPhone 17 ranges (excluding the iPhone 16e ). It's comprised of a ring of magnets on the back of the phone, and it was developed to create a faster, more precise wireless charging system. However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets. If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone. We have lots of case recommendations in our guides: When buying a wallet, make sure it supports MagSafe or “Qi2” connections. It should indicate this prominently in the product description", "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-magsafe-wallets/", "timestamp": 1764145565.7016501}

He has suggested some balanced lunch combinations that support digestion and liver detox. These lunch plates are clean, satisfying and great for digestion Dr Sethi points out that the gut works harder during the daytime, and if you are having a balanced lunch, it provides the fuel your gut needs to work efficiently. Eating the right food at lunch helps keep digestion smooth , protects the stomach lining, reduces inflammation and bloating, supports good bacteria , and helps reduce acidity. A clean meal is all you need for gut comfort.  A meal that is cooked in less oil and with low spices is ideal for balanced digestion , provides stable energy , prevents bloating and keeps the stomach light because of the balance of protein and fibre. It's a perfect mid-day meal for gut repair and digestive comfort. If you have a sensitive stomach, then Moong dal , Rice and beetroot raita is one of the best light meals for you. It cools the gut, hydrates the body, and boosts natural probiotics. The meal is deeply nourishing and is good for warm days, and keeps you energised without discomfort. Palak paneer and whole wheat roti , a healthy home-style meal, offers complex carbs that digest smoothly , bringing protein and iron that repair tissues and support energy. A perfect meal that feels both light and satisfying. Turkey is easy to digest and provides stable protein , avocado supports gut lining with healthy fats , lettuce keeps it refreshing, and carrot sticks add fibre. This lunch plate has low carbs and is anti-inflammatory , which keeps your stomach calm and perfect for a clean midday boost. Like these meals , we have more options like Wild Salmon Combo, Chickpea Sandwich, Brown Rice + Rajma, and Tofu Stir-Fry. These are also some meals that are rich in protein, fibre, carbs and have good fat , making them ideal for a good digestive system ", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/eat-right-at-mid-day-dr-sethis-gut-friendly-lunch-combos/slideshow/125582888.cms", "timestamp": 1764145602.6250017}

Studies show some blood types may carry a higher risk of liver disease​", "summary": "", "content": "Your blood group is far more than a transfusion detail. New evidence suggests it influences autoimmune disease susceptibility. This particular blood type shows heightened vulnerability to liver conditions where immunity misfires. Understanding this link empowers informed health choices and earlier screening for those at-risk. Type A individuals possess A antigens on red blood cells. These markers alter immune recognition patterns and tolerance mechanisms. The immune system becomes less proficient at distinguishing self from foreign threats. This immunological confusion predisposes Type A carriers toward autoimmune conditions, particularly liver-specific ones. Type B individuals demonstrate somewhat reduced vulnerability compared to Type A. The B antigen configuration influences immune signalling differently. Researchers believe the distinct surface marker arrangement provides partial insulation from autoimmune liver attacks, though risk remains elevated compared to Type O populations. Type O blood offers meaningful protection across autoimmune liver diseases. These individuals lack A or B antigens entirely, maintaining stronger innate immunity. The O antigen structure permits superior immune surveillance and tolerance calibration. This explains historically lower autoimmune disease incidence in Type O populations globally. Type AB individuals possess both A and B antigens simultaneously. This dual-marker presence creates maximum immune system confusion and weakest antigen-antibody coordination. Consequently, AB carriers face substantial autoimmune liver disease risk, though research remains limited due to AB's rarity. Eliminate alcohol entirely, as it exacerbates autoimmune liver inflammation catastrophically. Maintain sodium restriction to prevent ascites accumulation. Prioritise whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Regular exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep fortify immune regulation.

Dr Pal Manickam , a gastro expert, has praised her way of eating. He explains that her mindful biting and slow chewing is a great habit for gut health as it reduces bloating , improves digestion and stops overeating. Dr Pal said that her way of eating reflects one of the healthiest digestive habits , a clip that looked like she was only enjoying her food has a great science behind it - the mindful chewing. Most people eat so fastly that their bodies never get the chance to register their wellness. Fans found the clip cute, but the expert found something meaningful in it. The stomach works overtime every time we eat fastly because most of the time when we eat fastly the food is not chewed properly, which leads to bloating, acidity, cramps and indigestion . Dr Pal says many people think this happened because of bad food, but the main problem is “eating speed” itself, not the food. If you watch Janhvi's clip , she eats slowly , mindfully, not just for enjoying flavours, but she is also doing this because she can prevent overeating . According to doctor pal, eating quickly confuses body signals; the brain is not able to receive the “I am full” signal because of fast eating. Eating slowly helps the vagus nerve to work properly, which makes us realise we are full sooner rather than overeating. Dr Pal points out that mindful eating supports vagus nerve activity, and gentle biting and chewing helps the nerve to stay calm and responsive, which helps balance hunger hormones like ghrelin and leptin . And when the nerve is functioning properly, then it prevents overeating and midnight snacking without any restriction of a strict diet rule. Most people think that following a strict diet helps in digestion only, but it’s not true, if you know about the 15-15-15 rule, you won't need any strict diet.

Repeat tumour injections demand repeated cranial surgery risking infection, bleeding and even stroke. Nasal drops eliminate that hellish cycle. Now, researchers at Washington University and Northwestern University have cracked a medical milestone—tiny nanostructures delivered via simple nasal drops can now travel directly into the brain and wake up the immune system to fight glioblastoma, one of the deadliest cancers. Think of tiny golden spheres studded with DNA snippets. These \"spherical nucleic acids\" (SNAs) are engineered in labs to trigger a cellular alarm system called STING, basically telling immune cells: \"Wake up; there's cancer here.\" One or two nasal doses can trigger this cascade.​ Your olfactory and trigeminal nerves (smell and facial sensation pathways) connect directly to the brain, bypassing blood barriers that normally block drugs. Researchers harnessed this anatomical freeway; drops drip down, nerves transport cargo upward straight to tumours.​ Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of brain cancer and grows fast inside the brain tissue. Glioblastomas are \"cold\"—they hide from immune radar. It spreads through delicate neural pathways, making complete removal extremely difficult. Most patients survive only 12 to 18 months even with surgery and chemotherapy. Fewer than 7 percent make it past the five-year mark because the tumour resists treatment and returns quickly.

From Ranveer Singh’s bold experimentation to Hrithik Roshan’s athletic refinement, they’re shaping a modern , globally inspired era of Indian male fashion. Ranveer Singh has always been in the spotlight because of his fashion choices, and 2025 was no different from that. This year, by mixing streetwear with couture, colour with drama, and comfort with chaos, he created a lot of iconic looks. He proves men’s fashion isn’t about rules, it’s about expression. Shahid Kapoor owned the 2025 fashion trend with clean, minimal fashion. From airport to red carpet, every look of his was sleek this year from tailored blacks, earthy neutrals to effortless silhouettes that define his 2025 fashion game. Hrithik ’s wardrobe this year is all about ease,comfort and impact. From joggers to bomber jackets, he shows how athleisure can be classy, masculine and effortlessly attractive. Hirtik’s 2025 look is grounded in fitness but elevated with premium fabrics and precise fits. This year, Vicky bought and mixed street-style energy with desi elegance. His fashion mantra is simple: comfort without compromise. Linen shirts, breezy kurtas, denim jackets, rugged and effortlessly iconic. This year, Kartik bought the Boy-Next-Door style in bollywood fashion; he kept his look playful and laid-back. Oversized hoodies, denim layers, and soft knits give his 2025 looks a youthful streetwear touch. Simple style, strong impact. Ayushman balanced quirk and class together this year. Oversized shirts, patterned blazers, sharp jewellery and experimental colour , his 2025 fashion wardrobe was all about them. He turned menswear into art .

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating. But remaining businesses (Value Retail + Ethnic + D2C + Luxury) will need investments in the near term. Outlook We remain conservative and retain REDUCE on ABFRL; we will watch for margin gains in the remnant entity before turning constructive on the stock.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The former Bihar chief minister is named as an accused in four cases, including the land-for-jobs and IRCTC scam case, which are being heard by Special Judge Vishal Gogne. The plea, submitted by Rabri Devi before the Principal District and Sessions Judge submitted, “The applicant (Devi) is having a bonafide and reasonable apprehension that fair and impartial justice will not be rendered by the Special Judge and that the conduct of the Special Judge during the proceedings in all cases appears to be unduly inclined towards the prosecution and bias which can be seen from number of instances of the case proceedinds/order”. The plea claimed there was “a reasonable apprehension of bias” and that in the interest of justice, the cases needed to be transferred to another court of competent jurisdiction.

Expressing optimism about trade talks, the US President added, \"He's going to -- I think he's going to very much surprise you on the upside...\" \"I asked him, I'd like you to buy it a little faster. I'd like you to buy more. He's more or less agreed to do that. I think we will be pleasantly surprised by the actions of President Xi,\" Trump further said. The US President also reiterated that he had a \"great relationship\" with Xi, saying, \"I like him. He likes me.\" However, Trump made no mention of the contentious issue of Taiwan, which China claims to be a part of the mainland, and which, of late, has also caused tensions between Beijing and Tokyo.

A few users said that switching to Safari or using the Google Meet mobile app allowed them to join briefly, though the workaround wasn’t reliable.

The act has invited a strong reaction from the BJP and its ally, Shiv Sena , with at least two ministers from Maharashtra warning of action against the stand-up comedian on Tuesday. \"The police would take action against anyone who puts out such objectionable posts,\" Senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. In a social media post, Kamra was seen on Monday wearing a T-Shirt that arguably mocked the RSS. Shiv Sena cabinet minister Sanjay Shirsat, whose party is an ally of the BJP, insisted that the party must respond strongly to the comedian's controversial post, pointing out that Kamra had made vitriolic remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde in the past. \"Earlier, he targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Eknath Shinde, and now he has dared to directly attack the RSS. The BJP needs to respond to this,\" Shirsat said. \"We (Shiv Sena) responded to it (to Kamra's critical comments on Shinde earlier this year). Now, he has mustered the courage to make an objectionable post against the RSS,\" said the minister. Kamra is not new to controversies over his political jokes. In March, he courted controversy when he made critical comments against Maharashtra Deputy CM Eknath Shinde , who heads the Shiv Sena. The 36-year-old comedian had then taken a jibe at Shinde’s political career in his show by modifying the lyrics of a popular Hindi movie song.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not support him, though House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Governor Kathy Hochul did. \"Senator Schumer never endorsed him. I don’t even know if he’s met with him,\" Bessent said. President Trump also praised Mamdani, highlighting shared priorities for New York : \"We have one thing in common. We want this city of ours that we love to do very well. And I wanted to congratulate the mayor. He really ran an incredible race against a lot of smart people… And he beat them easily.\" Trump noted areas of mutual concern , including housing and food prices, saying: \"We talked about some things in very strong common, like housing and getting housing built and food and prices.\" Bessent stressed that governing presents practical challenges beyond campaigning, highlighting issues such as safety, sanitation, and public transit: “It’s easy to run a campaign, but the practical everyday of keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time, we’ll see.” Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

Derby Nov 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday the Federal Reserve's system of managing interest rates is struggling and needs to be simplified. \"We've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated\" and the U.S. central bank should \"simplify things,\" Bessent said in an interview with CNBC. \"The Fed has taken us into a new regime, and what is called ample-reserves regime. And it looks like that might be fraying a bit here in terms of whether the reserves are actually ample,\" Bessent said. The Treasury secretary did not say what he meant by fraying. The Fed has faced and continues to face challenging money market conditions tied to how it has been managing its $6.56 trillion balance sheet and financial system liquidity levels. Officials at the Fed's last policy meeting announced that they would stop the contraction of the central bank's overall balance sheet at the start of December. They did so as liquidity in financial markets in the run-up to the late October policy meeting tightened enough to complicate control of the federal funds rate, the Fed's primary tool to achieve its inflation and employment goals. The turbulence was such that it drove eligible financial firms to borrow notable levels of cash from the Fed via its Standing Repo Facility, a tool used to put a ceiling over short-term interest rates. There were also intermittent large inflows of cash into the Fed's reverse repo tool, which is used to set a floor underneath money market rates. CRITIC OF FED BALANCE SHEET Bessent has been a persistent Fed critic who has expressed particular concern about its large balance sheet, which is primarily stocked with trillions in bonds bought in large part to stabilize financial markets and to provide stimulus to the econom", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-treasury-secretary-takes-aim-at-feds-interest-rate-control-system-11764104527861.html", "timestamp": 1764145652.235054}

He said the decision was part of a new emphasis on speedy fleet expansion, and that funds designated for the shops will be “put toward future Navy needs.” The decision is a blow to Trieste, Italy-based Fincantieri SpA, whose Wisconsin-based subsidiary had been contracted to build the frigates. The company “will be involved” in the Navy’s plans, Phelan said. About $2.5 billion has been spent to date, the Navy said in a separate statement. “Keeping this critical workforce employed and the yard viable for future Navy shipbuilding is of foremost concern,” Phelan said. A key factor in today’s decision is “the need to grow the fleet faster to meet tomorrow’s threats,” he said. Trump touted the contracts toward the end of his first term as president, praising both their maneuverability and the fact that the Fincantieri subsidiary was based in the swing state of Wisconsin. In his closing remarks at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump reminded the audience of that fact. “It was a big contract that everybody wanted,” Trump said. “I gave it to Wisconsin, but we’re going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states.” But the program has long been beset by trouble. The Navy disclosed in April 2024 that the first frigate — which started construction in 2022 — was projected to be three years later than its contracted April 2026 delivery date. Much of the blame was put on difficulties in hiring an experienced workforce. The first vessel is 12% complete and the second has not started construction, according to the Navy.

According to the MS Now report, which cited three people without being named, the President and his top aides have grown increasingly frustrated by the unflattering headlines Kash Patel has recently generated. The report claimed that Patel has come under scrutiny for his stewardship of bureau resources, including his girlfriend’s security detail. However, reacting to the report, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a photo of Kash Patel and Donald Trump, saying this story is completely made up. “In fact, when this Fake News published, I was in the Oval Office, where President Trump was meeting with his law enforcement team, including FBI Director Kash Patel.” Leavitt claimed that when she read the headline to the President, he laughed and said: “What? That’s totally false. Come on Kash, let’s take a picture to show them you’re doing a great job!” “Do not believe the Fake News!,” she further added.  In September, Trump praised Kash Patel for swift action in arresting shooter involved in Charlie Kirk ’s assassination. \"I am very proud of the FBI.

Bailey has served as a distinguished attorney general for Missouri and is a decorated war veteran. In August, the Trump administration named Bailey to a new post of co-deputy director of the FBI alongside Dan Bongino. After Bailey's appointment, Patel had said Bailey would be an \"integral part\" of the agency's mission.

He said 25,000 soldiers had died in the past month, arguing that the conflict demanded urgent action. Trump said the original 28-point US peace proposal, drafted by Washington and widely criticised for aligning with Russian demands, had been “fine-tuned” with “additional input from both sides.” Only a few points of disagreement remain, he said, without providing details.

Bolsonaro who has exhausted all his appeals, will remain in a special room at police headquarters in Brasilia — a secure space for protected prisoners with a bed, TV, air conditioning and private bathroom — where he is currently detained. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president to start the sentence in an order issued on Tuesday. His lawyers had asked the court to allow him to serve the sentence under house arrest, citing his age and a litany of health problems. However, the court denied that request in a separate order on Saturday. The former president, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, was on trial over a botched coup bid. In August, he was placed under house arrest for violating measures imposed on him. In September, he was sentenced to 27 years in jail, following his conviction on charges that he attempted a coup to stop leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after his 2022 election defeat. On November 22, citing him as potential flight risk , Supreme Court ordered Bolsonaro's detention after more than 100 days of house arrest. According to court records, Bolsonaro had told the judge that medicine-induced paranoia and hallucination caused him to tamper with an electronic ankle monitor. Bolsonaro denied any intent to escape or try to remove the ankle monitor, reported Reuters. In a petition to the top court, Bolsonaro lawyers said that sending the former president to prison ‘will have serious consequences and represents a risk to his life’, adding, \"His health condition is already deeply debilitated.\" The lawyers argued that Bolsonaro has already been hospitalised three times — twice for tests and once due to a medical emergency.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday refused to elaborate on Moscow’s position regarding ongoing US–Ukraine negotiations over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, calling the surrounding discourse an “information frenzy.” “It is impossible to comment amid this information frenzy,” Peskov told reporters. “A lot of contradictory information is being published, contradictory statements, and so on.” Russian officials have largely avoided detailed public response to the weekend talks in Geneva, where US, European and Ukrainian officials discussed a revised American peace plan. Despite refusing specifics, Peskov stressed that the original US 28-point peace framework remains the only substantial document under consideration. “The original U.S. proposal is currently the only substantive thing,” he said. “We believe that it could be a very good basis for talks… this is what our president has stated.” Peskov referred to the plan as “Trump’s framework.” The initial draft was widely criticized for aligning with long-standing Kremlin demands — including Ukraine ceding territory, halving its armed forces, and accepting limits on long-range weapons.

Speaking at Newark Airport in New Jersey, Duffy said he has observed “a degradation in civility” among air travelers, prompting his decision to launch what he called a “civility campaign” during the heavy holiday travel season. Duffy encouraged travelers to rethink their airport attire. “Whether it’s a pair of jeans and a decent shirt, I would encourage people to maybe dress a little bit better, which encourages us to maybe behave a little better,” he said. “Let’s try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport.” He also urged passengers to avoid removing their shoes inflight or propping their feet on seats. “Don’t take your shoes off and put your feet on the chair ahead of you,” Duffy warned. The secretary urged travelers to show basic respect toward airline staff. “Say please and thank you to our pilots and to our flight attendants,” he said, adding that passengers should dress “with some respect.” He also encouraged passengers to help fellow travelers struggling with overhead baggage as a simple act of courtesy. Duffy’s initiative comes against the backdrop of a 400% surge in in-flight disturbances since 2019, according to FAA data.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764145685.366602}

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta?

This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why?

This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace?
