Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

IIE, a not-for-profit headquartered in New York, Monday released a fall 2025 snapshot survey on international student enrolment at 825 higher education institutions in the US. Around 57 per cent of these institutions reported a decrease in new international student enrolments for the 2025-26 academic year, while 14 per cent reported stable numbers, and 29 per cent indicated an increase.

These declines in new enrollment from India are likely driving the overall national declines in new enrollment,” the report on the fall 2025 session noted. In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals. While 96 per cent of institutions cited the visa application process as a factor in the decline of new international student enrolment this year, this figure was only 64 per cent in the fall of 2021, and was at 85 per cent last year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

He said 199 headmasters have honed their strategic and managerial skills at IIM Ahmedabad , and 144 primary teachers have completed an immersive training in Finland so far.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave.

According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation. In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process. The 2021 board exams were significantly delayed, starting on May 17 and ending on May 26. This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years. By 2023, the Telangana SSC exams returned closer to the usual time frame, being held from April 3 to April 13. The shorter, 11-day window helped the board align future sessions with the pre-pandemic calendar. The 2024 exams were conducted from March 18 to April 2, indicating a complete return to the standard March schedule. The examination period stretched over 16 days, giving students a familiar timetable after several disrupted years. For the 2025 session, the exams began on March 21 and concluded on April 4, continuing the trend of mid-March starts and early April endings.

The draft curriculum, which has been submitted to the NCERT for review, provides a structure for schools to introduce computational thinking and AI in a phased and progressive manner from classes 3 to 12.

As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag.

You can read the stories here .) – Anshu Taneja Chemistry forms the very bedrock of modern life, shaping everything from the chemicals we rely on to cutting-edge technologies. All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends.

Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts.

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless ” and pocket-sized . Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io , to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry.

Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after.

The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes. “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.

Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.” U.S. District Judge Eumi K.

Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission. “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding. The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation.

Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko , is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “ An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own .” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox , I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network.

AWS announced Monday it is investing $50 billion to build AI “high-performance computing infrastructure” purposefully built for the U.S. government. The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services. The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company. AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government. The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification. Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year.

It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October. As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark. Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. “There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.” Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.

The new fundraise comes less than a year after it expanded its Series C from $500 million to $700 million, bringing the total raised in the last year or so to $1.4 billion, a sizable amount even in the heady world of nuclear power startups. X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date. X-energy said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica. The new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures. X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity. Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led the first installment of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy more than 600 megawatts of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon’s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039.

Reuters first reported this weekend that DOGE had broken up, ending the months-long effort by Musk and his associates — many recruited from his various private-sector companies — to reduce alleged fraud and waste and cut employees across the federal government. DOGE was created by an executive order signed by President Trump in January. The initiative was expected to run for close to two years. As of early November, DOGE “doesn’t exist,” according to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources department. In a tweet on Sunday, Kupor said that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.” Amy Gleason, who was named as the “official” acting administrator of DOGE earlier this year, posted on LinkedIn soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.” While active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. DOGE’s cuts have also been blamed for countless deaths across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.

The feature, which allows users to post under a custom username instead of their real name, provides an alternative to posting anonymously. With anonymous posting, users can share without the post being connected to their Facebook profile and real-life identity, but this approach also doesn’t allow other group members to get to know them or their personality, or to follow their updates over time. Meta says that nicknames will allow people to participate in groups more personally while maintaining privacy, particularly in groups where users want privacy but still want to build a recognizable presence. It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s long-standing “real name” policy, which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life. That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections. After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature. This allows users to hide their main profile and profile photo from other members but not from group admins, moderators, or Facebook’s own systems.

Across large platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, users are watching billions of videos every day, with companies benefiting massively from this content explosion. For creators, this often means there is pressure to create more content than ever before to be relevant and make a living out of it, especially as more AI-generated slop is infiltrating these platforms. Jay Neo, a creator and former content lead for short videos at MrBeast, thinks AI can help creators understand what is working for them and also help them create new content ideas in that direction. That’s why, along with former Palantir engineer Shivam Kumar and creator Harry Jones, they are building a platform called Palo to aid creators. Neo joined MrBeast at 18 to work on viewer retention. In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped. “I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said. Neo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to get a baguette , which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format. In 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month. With these experiences, Neo understood there’s power in content formulation and analytics. During his time building Creaky, the team had multiple spreadsheets tracking different metrics around videos. At that time, one of Neo’s advisors suggested that he turn these insights into a product for creators, and he started working with Palo’s other co-founders in early 2024.

Stay with me — it’s not entirely far-fetched. Thanks to advances in AI, computing, and superconducting magnets , fusion power is closer than ever to commercial reality. It’s increasingly looking like fusion is more a question of “when” not “if.” And when it does happen, it promises to deliver large amounts of clean power from a plentiful fuel source — water. Putting a reactor on a ship isn’t necessarily unreasonable, either. Today, submarines and aircraft carriers powered by nuclear fission reactors routinely prowl the seas. They’re quiet, powerful, and can operate for decades before they need refueling. The civilian sector even toyed with the idea of nuclear-powered cargo ships back in the 1960s and 1970s. “Fission has definitely paved the way in terms of nuclear power on ships,” Cohen, who co-founded Maritime Fusion , told TechCrunch. Fusion promises to give ships similar capabilities but without concerns over meltdowns, proliferation, or radiation. For now, the sector has been focused on building the first reactors on land. “I’m pretty sure we’re the first people to ever really look at what is it like to put a tokamak on a ship,” Cohen said, referring to a leading fusion reactor design. If fusion does pan out, then Maritime’s leap to the seas would put it ahead of the curve. Plus, Cohen argues, it might actually be easier from a business perspective to start out at sea. The first fusion power plants won’t be cheap, and it will take some time before they come down in cost. “Competing against things like solar and wind on the grid is super challenging from a cost perspective,” Cohen said. At sea, the economics look different. Ammonia and hydrogen are two leading contenders to replace diesel and bunker fuel on cargo ships, but they’re still pretty pricey. “Those are some of the ot", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/this-startup-wants-to-build-a-fusion-reactor-on-a-boat/", "timestamp": 1764044803.0623598}

But by the time he was asked about a report claiming the company had prioritized growth over safety, Baszucki seemed to tire of the topic, responding, “Fun. Let’s keep going down this.” And when co-host Kevin Roose agreed that one of the best ways for Roblox to improve child safety is to improve its AI models, Baszucki insisted, “Good, so you’re aligning with what we did. High-five.” “And I want to highlight, I came here because I love your podcast and came to talk about everything,” he added. “So if our PR people said, ‘Let’s talk about age-gating for an hour,’ I’m up for it, but I love your pod.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool. From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works. I've found Unbound's T-shirts in particular to be very quick-drying and wrink", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/unbound-merino-black-friday-sale-2025/", "timestamp": 1764044894.8499427}

You can grab an Oura Ring 4 for just $249 from Amazon , a $100 break from the normal price. It's compatible with both iOS and Android apps, has a battery that last for days, and accurately tracks a ton of health data, from hiking and sleeping to period predictions and food intake. Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability. The sensors have been recessed further into the body of the ring itself, which reduces the overall thickness considerably and allows for a wider available range of ring sizes. They also cover a wider portion of the ring, so there's no need to keep it oriented in one specific direction to get proper readings. The battery life has improved a lot as well. The older Oura 3 could run for around three days before it needed a charge, Our reviewer, Adrienne So, reported that the Ring 4 tracked a full weekend of hiking and physical activity, as well as a music festival, and still had enough juice for at least a couple more days. You get a ton of health and physical fitness data from the ring, which is neatly sorted into daily physical data, detailed vitals, and longer trends over time, all organized in the app on your phone. If you want to also keep track of your food intake, a new Meals feature lets you take photos of what you eat and then track its effects on your body. Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes. Thankfully, the mirrored silver and classic black are marked down to the lower $249 price point, with varying discounts on the other options, like $299 for the brushed silver ,", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/oura-ring-4-deal-1125/", "timestamp": 1764044895.012679}

The console you spent countless hours huddled around as a kid is now old enough to be crippled by student debt and burdened with existential despair, just like you! If that reminder of the cruel and ceaseless march of time makes you want to retreat into a nostalgic bubble when life was easier and, say, play some N64 games, unfortunately, that's been pretty tricky in recent years. Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly due to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs in terms of connectivity or resolution. Analogue 3D Rating: 9/10 Enter, then, the Analogue3D, the latest console from the makers of the Analogue Pocket . Like its portable predecessor, this is a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) piece of kit that perfectly mimics the original console, allowing you to play authentic game carts without emulation. It goes beyond being a third-party remake though—it runs those games better than ever thanks to a baked-in virtualized Expansion Pak and the ability to overclock, beautifully presenting games with a host of display options, and outputting it all in glorious 4K. Throw in universal support for N64 carts and accessories from anywhere in the world, meaning the region lockouts of the '90s are literally a thing of the past, and this might just be my favorite \"new\" console of 2025.

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet cofounded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him.

It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal. ROMs (read-only memory) in the context of retro gaming are digital copies of video games.

This means that security teams at tech companies have more code than ever to review while dealing with even more pressure from bad actors. On Monday, Amazon will publish details for the first time of an internal system known as Autonomous Threat Analysis (ATA), which the company has been using to help its security teams proactively identify weaknesses in its platforms, perform variant analysis to quickly search for other, similar flaws, and then develop remediations and detection capabilities to plug holes before attackers find them. ATA was born out of an internal Amazon hackathon in August 2024, and security team members say that it has grown into a crucial tool since then. The key concept underlying ATA is that it isn't a single AI agent developed to comprehensively conduct security testing and threat analysis. Instead, Amazon developed multiple specialized AI agents that compete against each other in two teams to rapidly investigate real attack techniques and different ways they could be used against Amazon's systems—and then propose security controls for human review. “The initial concept was aimed to address a critical limitation in security testing—limited coverage and the challenge of keeping detection capabilities current in a rapidly evolving threat landscape,\" Steve Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, tells WIRED. “Limited coverage means you can’t get through all of the software or you can’t get to all of the applications because you just don’t have enough humans. And then it’s great to do an analysis of a set of software, but if you don’t keep the detection systems themselves up to date with the changes in the threat landscape, you’re missing half of the picture.” As part of scaling its use of ATA, Amazon developed special “high-fidelity” testing environments that are deeply real", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-autonomous-threat-analysis/", "timestamp": 1764044895.7856035}

Medical technology company Masimo alleged that Apple had infringed on its patent. However, in August 2025, Apple redesigned the sensor via a software update, and you now have this feature again. Blood oxygen sensing is back! Apple revamped its entire Apple Watch line this year, which includes the entry-level Watch SE 3, the flagship Watch Series 11, and the Watch Ultra 3.

A great way to liven up a club sandwich or add heart to a hot soup, homemade, unprocessed bread not only tastes great but can be easily made in one of the latest bread makers in just a few simple steps.

Bread makers come with various settings for bread styles beyond your standard loaf too—with French, gluten-free, whole wheat, and sweet options such as banana and date loaf all just a “set and forget it until it’s ready” step away. Some bread machines also have settings for making pizza and pasta dough or fruit jam, which is great if you’re feeling even more adventurous in the kitchen. “Time and temperature are essential in bread baking, and consistency is one of the biggest variances we face as bakers,” Peter Edris, head baker at New York’s artisan Frenchette Bakery , told WIRED when we asked him how he creates the perfect loaf. “If you want to make good bread, then you need to have the right equipment for the job—invest in a good scale, a good thermometer, and time everything.” Without a team of professional bakery staff on hand, we embraced the shortcut solution to domestic bliss and called in a range of the latest bread makers to test.

Wood said OpenAI is actively looking for a replacement and that, in the interim, Vallone’s team will report directly to Johannes Heidecke, the company’s head of safety systems. Vallone’s departure comes as OpenAI faces growing scrutiny over how its flagship product responds to users in distress . In recent months, several lawsuits have been filed against OpenAI alleging that users formed unhealthy attachments to ChatGPT. Some of the lawsuits claim ChatGPT contributed to mental health breakdowns or encouraged suicidal ideations. Amid that pressure, OpenAI has been working to understand how ChatGPT should handle distressed users and improve the chatbot’s responses. Model policy is one of the teams leading that work, spearheading an October report detailing the company’s progress and consultations with more than 170 mental health experts. In the report, OpenAI said hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT users may show signs of experiencing a manic or psychotic crisis every week, and that more than a million people “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Through an update to GPT-5, OpenAI said in the report it was able to reduce undesirable responses in these conversations by 65 to 80 percent. “Over the past year, I led OpenAI’s research on a question with almost no established precedents: how should models respond when confronted with signs of emotional over-reliance or early indications of mental health distress?” wrote Vallone in a post on LinkedIn.

However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets. If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone.

It’s probably no surprise they're all OLEDs , which not only control each tiny point of light at the pixel level, but have also gotten brighter and better in each of the last few years. What might surprise you if you haven’t shopped TVs in a while is that Panasonic now joins the usual suspects from Samsung, Sony, and LG with its new flagship, the Z95B. It’s a doozy. As with last year’s Z95A that marked Panasonic’s impressive US return , the Z95B provides near-flawless performance, from perfect black levels to pristine detail and colors. It’s brighter and more striking, thanks to skillful deployment of the same breakthrough RGB tandem panel used in the stunning LG G5 , and its built-in sound is easily the best I’ve heard from any TV all year. The biggest downside is that its premium performance is again paired with a budget smart interface; Panasonic’s version of Fire TV is awkwardly laid out and flooded with Amazon ads, right down to the remote. But for well-heeled buyers who'd rather sub in a streaming device over a soundbar or speakers , the Z95B is one of the best TVs I've laid eyes (or ears) on. Setting up the Z95B’s hardware is joyously simple once you pry it loose from its jigsaw of foam and cardboard. The industrial-strength swivel stand comes in one piece and attaches in seconds, keeping the 65-inch model I tested stable and accessible with four small screws. The TV looks the part of a premium flagship, with thin bezels and fabric-wrapped acoustic accents. Panasonic Z95B OLED TV Rating: 9/10 The circular base is slim enough to support an add-on soundbar, but this TV functions best as an all-in-one.

But these days, the best Chromebooks can be real alternatives to Windows laptops and MacBooks. Throw in a fresh focus on handy AI features, and you have a range of affordable computers that make a strong case for replacing your aging machine. ChromeOS still doesn’t compete with Windows and Macs for heavy-duty stuff like gaming and video editing, but it isn’t trying to. The beauty of Chromebooks is that they offer a lightweight portal to the things that most people need a computer for, without any extra fluff. If you spend all day in a web browser, work with Google apps, and do some occasional light photo editing, a solid Chromebook could be all you need. WIRED has tested Chromebooks for more than a decade, and we’re always on the lookout for the best ones to spend your hard-earned money on. These are the models we recommend right now.

The Chromebook Plus 14 bucks this trend, adding a gorgeous OLED panel and a smooth touchpad that feels premium. It even comes with a decent sound system and webcam, elements of cheap laptops that are often ignored.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war. Aaron Roth suspects that the pitfalls of algorithmic pricing may not have a simple sol", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/game-theory-explains-how-algorithms-can-drive-up-prices/", "timestamp": 1764044898.870346}

But what if you want to bring the full excitement of the movies home? How can you ensure you’re getting an audio performance that will do justice to the pictures you’re watching? By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need. Below you'll find everything you need to know about getting started with surround sound, and the kind of setup you will need in order to achieve it. Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup. You may have seen surround sound setups described numerically—most commonly as 5.1-channel or 7.1-channel surround sound systems, but so", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-perfect-surround-sound-speaker-setup/", "timestamp": 1764044899.0175524}

One surprise is owning a dog.” The study , led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.” The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions. But mere hours after the AP published its article, its aim had been recast as something else entirely: an attack on people’s furry family members. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one Reddit user wrote. Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals.

Set in late 1800s Japan, Last Samurai Standing follows retired samurai Shujiro Saga (Junichi Okada), who enters the savage \"Kodoku\" tournament in a desperate effort to save his family, struck down by cholera. The problem is, he's one of 292 former samurai aiming to win the ¥100,000 prize, and the only way to progress through the competition is to collect tags from fallen enemies and pass through checkpoints set up by the event's mysterious organizers. It's going to be a bloodbath. Based on the series of Japanese novels written by Shogo Imamura and illustrated by Katsumi Tatsuzawa, this packs in some of the finest sword duels and martial arts sequences ever committed to the screen, all while exploring the rapidly changing face of Japanese society after the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Think Squid Game set in Meiji era Japan, and you're scratching the surface of this thrilling six-episode miniseries.

Here are our favorites to make your morning cup of coffee.", "content": "Amazon Amazon Amazon Williams Sonoma The French press is an unassuming piece of coffee-making equipment. It doesn’t use electricity, yet experts agree that it can brew a richer and more full-bodied cup of joe than its more technologically advanced peers . For example, natural oils that would otherwise be filtered out in a drip coffee maker remain fully intact, making the coffee aromatic and robust. The French press method of making coffee is straightforward, cost-effective, easy to do, and hard to mess up. The device also doesn’t take up too much counter space, especially if you're using our top pick, the Espro P3 ($40) . Once you have your measurements down, it’s a quick process of steeping coarse coffee grounds in near-boiling water. We tested these models using the James Hoffmann French press technique , in which he uses 30 grams of coffee to 500 grams of water, waits for four minutes, and stirs through the crust. Whether you choose a French press made from glass or stainless steel, a few factors make a difference based on your personal coffee needs. Want to make the process even easier? Take a look at our guides to the Best Aeropresses , Best Electric Kettles , and Best Coffee Subscriptions .

Espro Amazon Sur La Table Out of all the strainers that many French presses tout, the Espro P3’s microfilters were the most effective at removing coffee grounds. Unlike most French press filters, the Espro press's are made of fine mesh, and there are two of them, so the coffee grounds are filtered twice. The filters are in the shape of a basket with a solid plastic bottom and fine mesh walls. One would probably do the trick on its own, but for extra assurance, the Espro adds another strainer of the same build.

The issue stems from WhatsApp’s discovery feature, which allows someone to enter a person’s phone number to see if they’re on the app. By doing this billions of times—which WhatsApp did not prevent—researchers from the University of Vienna uncovered what they’re calling “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever . Vaping is a major problem in US high schools. But is the solution to spy on students in the bathroom? An investigation by The 74, copublished with WIRED, found that schools around the country are turning to vape detectors in an effort to crack down on nicotine and cannabis consumption on school grounds. Some of the vape detectors go far beyond detecting vapor by including microphones that are surprisingly accurate and revealing. While few defend addiction and drug use, even non-vapers say the added surveillance and the punishments that result go too far. Don’t look now, but that old networking equipment your company hasn’t thought about in years may jump out and bite you. Tech giant Cisco this week launched a new initiative, warning companies that AI tools are making it increasingly simple for attackers to find vulnerabilities in outdated and unpatched networking infrastructure. The message: Upgrade or else. If you’ve ever attended a conference, you probably worried about getting sick in the cesspools that are a conference center. But one hacker conference in New Zealand, Kawaiicon, invented a novel way to keep attendees a little bit safer. By tracking the CO 2 levels in each conference room, Kawaiicon’s organizers were able to create a real-time air-quality monitoring system , which would tell people which rooms were safe and which seemed … gross.

This could vastly improve a seriously fractured landscape, enabling you to easily add and access your cameras on whatever platform you choose. It’s also something that can potentially be delivered in a software update, so some of the cameras you already own might get Matter support. All the top gear news of the week in one place . Here's more you may have missed this week: You may be worrying about limitations, but the supported feature list is impressive, including video and audio streaming, two-way communication, local and remote access, multiple streams, pan-tilt-zoom controls, and both detection and privacy zones. There’s also support for continuous or event-based recording, either locally or to the cloud. What it won’t handle is how that storage is managed, meaning some camera manufacturers will still require you to use their cloud-based subscription models. Pleasingly, there are no limitations on resolution, unlike Apple HomeKit Secure Video , or restrictions on AI detection features. Matter is using WebRTC technology, with remote access handled via the STUN and TURN protocols, meaning that manufacturers can choose to implement end-to-end encryption for footage.

Designed to sit under your TV as comfortably as it would under a monitor, these are micro PCs —but only because Valve seems shy of branding them consoles . The new Steam Machines are Valve's second attempt at launching a dedicated device to bring the PC into the living room. The first generation Steam Machines launched a decade ago, in November 2015, and while that iteration ultimately flopped , the marketplace in 2025 is much different. The Steam Deck has been a huge success, inspiring a whole fleet of gaming handhelds —with even Xbox joining the party —and PC gaming as a whole is in a much stronger position. So, when the announcement video for this new product family went to great lengths to explain that the new Steam Machine is still a PC and not a console, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. Valve makes and sells PC games; here's a PC to play those games on. Except … c'mon, look at it: In every way that counts, the new Steam Machine effectively is a console—and that's no bad thing. Pop quiz: What defines a games console? Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big-screen television. The benefits include fixed specifications, meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers know that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course). Roughly every half-decade, they might buy a new-generation model. What then defines a PC, gaming or otherwise? Almost the opposite—a typically desk-bound rig, built from whatever parts the user fancies, and when they need a bit more power, they can swap", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/valve-says-steam-machine-isnt-a-console-but-it-is/", "timestamp": 1764044902.4883282}

A police scanner recording archived on the app describes the suspect by name and alleges he may have purchased weapons with the intention of targeting additional OpenAI locations. Hours before the incident on Friday, the individual who police flagged as allegedly making the threat said he was no longer part of Stop AI in a post on social media. In a statement to WIRED which was subsequently posted on X, Stop AI disavowed the alleged actions of the individual and said the organization is “deeply committed to nonviolence.” WIRED reached out to the man in question but did not immediately receive a response.

The deal: an iPad Air for 15 euros (about $17) instead of the usual €879 (about $1,012). No catch, no strings attached. The proximity to Black Friday only made the offer more plausible. And so several consumers immediately purchased the product by choosing the “payment and pickup in store” opetion, on paper the safest to avoid unexpected problems.

Use the star function to highlight notable finds.", "content": "Last week, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released 20,000 documents from the estate of registered sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein . They included thousands of emails sent between Epstein and high-profile people like Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, political strategist Steve Bannon , journalist Michael Wolff, and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers , as well as revealing text messages . Many of them allude or directly refer to president Donald Trump. Now, you can browse all those emails just like you would on your own Gmail account. Jmail is a website that looks very much like Gmail, except that there is a little hat hanging on the logo and that the profile picture in the top right corner is a grinning Epstein. (Click on it and it says “Hi Jeffrey!”) The inbox lets you click through thousands of emails, formatted to look exactly like a regular message would in your inbox. In the sidebar, you can sort by Inbox, Starred, and Sent. In Gmail, a lower sidebar section reads Labels and separates emails by category. In Jmail, it is a list of people who corresponded with Epstein. The site was created by serial prankster Riley Walz and Luke Igel, cofounder of an AI video editing tool called Kino AI . Igel tells WIRED that he brought the idea to Walz—something Walz confirms—and then the two of them put the website together with Cursor in a single night. Walz revealed Jmail in an X post , writing, “We cloned Gmail, except you're logged in as Epstein and can see his emails.” Jmail is a much more readable way to peruse the huge cache of emails released from the Epstein estate than parsing through tens of thousands of PDFs on a Google Drive.

Both platforms get access to one-touch pairing and the helpful Beats app, while iPhone owners also get the benefits of Hey Siri and Find My Device. The other features are a bit of a mixed bag, with a decent battery life of up to 24 hours with ANC on, or 40 with ANC off, but no auto pause when you take them off, or multi-point pairing beyond Google's Chromebook and Android option. Like most headphones from Beats, the sound profile is decidedly bass-forward, but Apple's ownership has tempered that tendency over the last few years. As a result, this generation is more balanced than previous eras, with our reviewer Ryan Waniata complimenting the expansive sound stage and sharp details. Unfortunately, most Beats headsets don't have any equalizer, and the Studio Pro are no different. For better or worse, you're stuck with how they sound coming out of the box. These at least support high-resolution audio, up to 24-bit/48-kHz, but only in the wired USB-C mode. For the Beats enthusiast looking for an upgrade or a second headset for the gym, these are a solid option at a deeply discounted price.

In China, parents are buying them for children as young as five. Adults want to be able to call their kids and track their location down to a specific building floor. But that’s not why children are clamoring for the devices, specifically ones made by a company called Xiaotiancai, which translates to Little Genius in English. The watches, which launched in 2015 and cost up to $330, are a portal into an elaborate world that blends social engagement with relentless competition. Kids can use the watches to buy snacks at local shops, chat and share videos with friends, play games, and, sure, stay in touch with their families. But the main activity is accumulating as many “likes” as possible on their watch’s profile page. On the extreme end, Chinese media outlets have reported on kids who buy bots to juice their numbers, hack the watches to dox their enemies, and sometimes even find romantic partners. According to tech research firm Counterpoint Research, Little Genius accounts for nearly half of global market share for kids’ smartwatches. Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle. She racked up more than one million likes and became a mini-celebrity on the platform. She said she met all three of her boyfriends through the watch, two of whom she broke up with because they asked her to send erotic photos. High like counts have become a sort of status symbol. Some enthusiastic Little Genius users have taken to RedNote (or Xiaohongshu), a", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/kids-in-china-are-scheming-and-buying-bots-to-win-clout-on-their-watches/", "timestamp": 1764044903.6785743}

The queries appear to be connected to an ongoing investigation by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’s chair, Senator Rand Paul, into the “weaponization of the Quiet Skies Program,” which was the subject of a September 30 hearing on Capitol Hill. While Paul’s inquiry was lauded by Muslim-American organizations as a long-overdue examination of abusive federal surveillance, it appears the inquiry is a broader attempt to target academic researchers on extremism, which could chill inquiries into far-right radicalization. At least three university research centers focused on extremism received requests for documentation from the Senate committee in the past two months. A copy of a letter from the committee reviewed by WIRED asks the university that received it to turn over records for all communications, reports, memoranda, or data exchanged with federal staff from January 1, 2020, through February 1, 2025, and any records regarding Quiet Skies and the No Fly List, the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database. The university was also instructed to identify all staff who held federal security clearances, any and all sources of federal grant funding, and internal procedures. Critically, sources tell WIRED that the Senate committee requested the research centers disclose all emails, internal and external, relating to a massive list of more than 300 query terms, which include “mask mandates,” “origins of Covid-19,” “Trump supporters or the Trump Campaign,” “Capitol Police.” FBI director Kash Patel, US attorney general Pam Bondi, Department of Justice operative and former interim US attorney for the Distr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/senators-want-extremism-researchers-to-surrender-documents-linked-to-right-wing-grudges/", "timestamp": 1764044903.7793558}

The video, posted by Instagram user Nomadic Teju, shows him in Greater Noida’s Gaur City explaining how his friend’s situation deteriorated after he resigned from his job hoping to find a better opportunity. He points out that flats in the area usually cost between ₹ 1 crore and ₹ 2 crore, while monthly rents can reach ₹ 30,000–35,000. According to him, the engineer had once lived in one of these apartments with his family. But the hiring slowdown left him without work, forcing him to rent out his own flat and move into a rented one instead. With EMIs still pending and no steady income, he is now relying on part-time Rapido rides and occasional freelance projects to get by. The clip has sparked a wider conversation online about the challenges facing tech workers amid AI-related disruptions and limited hiring. “This is just the beginning… A large number of people are already losing their jobs, and even more will lose them in the future,” one user commented. Another wrote, “Long story short - It's going to be more challenging in India… If anyone has chance to move abroad then don't think twice unless you have a good plan.” “Just gona get worse with more AI adoption,” a third user said, advising people to avoid major purchases. Another suggested, “People who are already in a housing loan should act now, sell at a high rate, sit on cash, and pay off the loan to be stress-free.” Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

Earlier, lawmakers at the parliamentary session focused on questions about editorial standards raised by Michael Prescott, a former journalist and external editorial standards adviser to the BBC, the Associated Press reported. Prescott was the author of an internal note to BBC bosses that raised concerns about the editing of the Trump speech as well as other instances perceived as showing a left-leaning bias at the broadcaster. Among other things, it alleged that the broadcaster’s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The Daily Telegraph newspaper published that note in early November, sparking the latest crisis. The BBC drew Trump's ire — and deep public scrutiny — after an internal memo compiled by one of its former external advisers was leaked to the British media. The memo criticised cases of alleged biased reporting over a documentary on Trump that was aired days before the 2024 US presidential election, as well as other BBC coverage, including its stance on transgender issues, Gaza and race. Chairman Samir Shah said the broadcaster should have acted much quicker in addressing the allegations.  The third-party production company that made the documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — spliced together three quotes from a speech Trump gave on January 6, 2021, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” The editing made it look like Trump was directly encouraging his supporters to storm the US Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. Shah has acknowledged that the docum", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/bbc-officials-grilled-by-lawmakers-over-its-editorial-standards-after-trumps-threat-to-file-billion-dollar-lawsuit-11764039669293.html", "timestamp": 1764044943.4993713}

Following the revision, Washington and Kyiv described the new draft as a “refined peace framework.” After the Geneva meeting, Zelensky said, “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points – no longer 28 – and many of the right elements have been taken into account in this framework. Our team has reported on the new draft of steps, and this is indeed the right approach – I will discuss the sensitive issues with President Trump.” The plan, reduced from 28 provisions to 19, has dropped one of the most contentious elements of Trump's peace proposal – a requirement that Ukraine surrender Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of the Donbas, to Russia, according to the New York Post . Ukraine has called the provision to cede the Luhansk and Donetsk territories to Russia unacceptable. Reports suggest US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, will meet at a later date to sort out the territorial issue.

A cloud of volcanic ash from the Hayli Gubbi eruption in Ethiopia has reached Delhi, blanketing parts of the city in a thin layer of haze. IMD director general M Mohapatra told HT that the volcanic plume is not expected to significantly affect Delhi’s pollution levels, as it is travelling at very high altitudes. On air quality, he said it is “unclear whether it will impact air quality, but any significant impact is unlikely as it is at higher levels.” He explained that the ash cloud is currently “nearing Gujarat” and is likely to begin influencing “Delhi-NCR and neighbouring northern India in the next few hours,” though its impact will mainly be felt in aviation. Since the plume is “in the upper-levels,” he noted that its effect near the surface will be limited. Residents may instead observe “a hazy, cloudy sky… its impact expected for a few hours, as it continues to move further eastwards.” Mohapatra added that some cities may experience “a marginal rise in the temperature” because the ash mass behaves like cloud cover.

This comes as a latest blow against a program that has for decades welcomed people fleeing war and persecution into the country. The review is likely to trigger confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the US during that period. It is likely to face legal challenges from advocates, some of whom said the move was part of the administration's “cold-hearted treatment” of people trying to build new lives in the US. The memo, signed by the director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services , Joseph Edlow, and dated Friday, stated that during the Biden administration, “expediency” and “quantity” were prioritised over “detailed screening and vetting.” The memo said that warranted a comprehensive review and “re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.” The memo indicated that there will be a list of people to re-interview within three months. The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the US during the stated time period. “USCIS is ready to uphold the law and ensure the refugee program is not abused,” Edlow wrote. People admitted to the US as refugees are required to apply for a green card one year after they arrive in the country and usually five years after that can apply for citizenship. US Citizenship and Immigration Services , the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The moves described in the memo are the latest to aim for the refugee program, which the administration suspended earlier this year and later set a limit for entries to 7,500 mostly white South Africans — a historic low of refugees to be admitted to the US since the program’s inception in 1980.

The province’s capital, also named Taiz, has been a battleground pitting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and other militias backed by the Islamist Islah party against each other as well as other factions in Yemen’s civil war. Taiz, in the southwest, is the junction of two crucial highways: an east-west road leading to the coastal city of Mocha on the Red Sea, and another north-south, to Sanaa via Dhamar and Ibb provinces. It has been under Houthi blockade since 2016 as part of their war against the internationally recognized Yemeni government. The country's brutal war began in 2014, when the Houthis marched from their northern stronghold of Saada province and forced the internationally recognized government into exile.

Guru Tegh Bahadur was born in Amritsar, Punjab, in 1621, and was executed in 1675 in Delhi. Guru Tegh Bahadur, known as 'Hind ki Chadar' and the ‘Shield of India’ is revered as a hero for protecting people from forced religious conversions during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Historical accounts say that a group of Kashmiri Pandits approached him for help when Aurangzeb’s oppressive policies forced them to give up their faith and religion. Guru Tegh Bahadur stood up for them, openly challenging the decree. In 1675, he was arrested and taken to Delhi, where he too was ordered to abandon his faith. He refused, choosing martyrdom over submission. On Aurangzeb’s orders, he was beheaded at the site where the revered Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib stands today. Here are some famous quotes by Guru Tegh Bahdur: 1. “The world is a passing dream; only the remembrance of the Divine is real.” 2. “He who surrenders ego at the Lord’s feet finds freedom in every breath.” 3. “In pain and comfort alike, remember God, and your mind will find peace.” 4. “One who sees this world as temporary does not cling to its illusions.” 5. “Meditation on the Naam washes away the dust of countless worries.” 6. “When the mind is anchored in God, storms outside cannot shake it.” 7. “The body is but a garment; the soul belongs forever to the Timeless One.” 8. “True joy is not in possessions but in union with the Divine.” 9. “Give your head, but do not give up your faith and principles.” 10. “To protect another’s right to pray is also an act of true devotion.” 11. “Fear no one but the One; then no tyrant can overpower your spirit.” 12. “Courage is to stand alone for truth when the whole world is silent.” 13. “Bett", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/guru-teg-bahadur-shaheedi-diwas-2025-whatsapp-quotes-messages-to-mark-the-ninth-sikh-gurus-martyrdom-anniversary-11764002442866.html", "timestamp": 1764044945.2882836}

The inclusion of mozzarella in the PLI scheme has boosted its production and export.", "content": "New Delhi: India is emerging as an unexpected player in the global mozzarella market, upending a space long dominated by Western suppliers. The surge comes even as several trading partners continue pressing New Delhi for greater access to India’s dairy market, including cheese, as part of ongoing negotiations, according to government trade data reviewed by Mint . Exports of mozzarella jumped from nil in FY23 to $0.71 million in FY24 and $2.29 million in FY25, and the momentum has strengthened this year. Shipments reached $3.29 million in April–September 2025, marking an over 1,200% increase year-on-year, the data showed. India’s overall dairy exports were at $493 million in FY25, up 80% from the previous fiscal year. Analysts attribute the rise to booming global pizza demand, the competitive pricing and texture of buffalo-milk mozzarella—the preferred cheese for pizza—and recent investments spurred by the government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. These are early signs that India’s dairy sector is starting to move up the value chain even as Europe, the US and New Zealand continue to dominate the global cheese trade. In India, mozzarella is largely made from buffalo milk, which gives it a firmer texture and higher fat content compared to cow-milk variants, said Tarun Shridhar, former secretary, animal husbandry & dairying and director general of the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture (ICFA). With the world’s largest buffalo population, India holds a natural advantage in producing this variety, and exporters say the quality of buffalo-milk mozzarella is increasingly being recognized in the overseas markets.

The move comes amid a 30-day deadline imposed by the newly enacted Epstein Files Transparency Act. US Attorney Jay Clayton, appointed by Attorney General Pam Bondi to oversee investigations linked to Epstein , signed the motion seeking judicial approval for the release of materials, subject to necessary redactions. “In the light of the Act’s clear mandate, the Court should authorize the Department of Justice to release the grand jury transcripts and exhibits and modify any preexisting protective orders that would otherwise prevent public disclosure by the Government of materials the disclosure of which is required by the Act,” the motion stated, according to the news outlet. The filings noted that redactions could be applied to materials that “would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution,” though they did not reference ongoing investigations into prominent figures including Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, and Reid Hoffman, recently ordered by Trump . The DOJ requested an expedited ruling, emphasizing that it would coordinate with relevant US Attorney’s offices to properly redact victim-related and personally identifying information. The department had previously sought approval to release the grand jury materials in August , but judges denied the request, ruling the government had not demonstrated sufficient legal grounds to unseal the documents. Judge Richard Berman, who presided over Epstein’s 2019 case, rejected a Trump administration request in August, writing that a “significant and compelling reason” existed to keep the transcripts sealed.

The announcement could come as soon as today (November 24). “Until President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the Administration’s healthcare positions is mere speculation,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said, according to USA Today. The policy proposal reportedly includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies set to expire at the end of December , combined with new eligibility limits for enrollment, Politico reported. Without an extension, about 22 million Americans who rely on Obamacare tax credits could see their monthly premiums more than double in 2026, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). The expiring subsidies have put Congress, particularly Republicans, in a political dilemma as they seek to avoid a major backlash ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Also, as part of the recently approved deal to end the 43-day government shutdown , Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the subsidies in December. Trump has long advocated overhauling the ACA, the signature health law of former President Barack Obama. He has floated sending federal dollars directly to consumers rather than health insurance companies. The health care announcement comes shortly after the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dissolved with eight months left on its mandate. OPM Director Scott Kupor told Reuters that DOGE “doesn’t exist”. DOGE had previously claimed to have cut tens of billions of dollars in government spending, though the office did not provide detailed public accounting.

Gloria Esperanza Arriero, director of Colombia’s national immigration service, confirmed to The Associated Press that officials questioned nine adult sect members during a hotel inspection on Sunday in the town of Yarumal, in northwestern Colombia. Police said the operation took place on Saturday after residents alerted authorities to the group’s presence. Officers moved quickly, citing warning signs of a potential trafficking network. According to a police report, “There are indications that some of them may have been kidnapped, suggesting a possible human trafficking scenario, under the guise of religious activity.” The children — who come from several countries, including the United States and Guatemala — were moved to a government-run protection center. Arriero said that five of the rescued children were listed in Interpol Yellow Notices, which are global alerts for missing persons or potential victims of parental or criminal abduction. She said her agency acted after determining the group arrived in Colombia in late October and was staying in a hotel while looking for rural land to establish a new base. Arriero noted that officials were able to intervene quickly because the group lacked an established site. “The positive thing in all of this is that we got to the children before they had a compound,” she said. “Because in that case, we would have required a search warrant.” In Colombia, immigration officials are authorized to carry out checks in hotels to verify the legal status of foreign visitors and determine whether they are wanted by international law enforcement.

US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie concluded that Lindsey Halligan — a former Trump personal attorney appointed interim US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September — was installed “hastily and without proper authority.” The unlawful appointment, the judge said, rendered her actions legally void and undermined the integrity of the politically charged cases. Halligan was named to the post after interim US attorney Erik Siebert resigned under pressure from the Trump administration to pursue charges against Comey and James. Comey’s lawyers argued that once Siebert stepped down, only the district’s federal judges had the authority to fill the vacancy, not the White House. Currie dismissed both indictments without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department could theoretically refile the charges. Comey and James had asked for dismissals with prejudice to prevent any future prosecution. It remains unclear whether the DOJ will attempt to revive either case. Comey was indicted on allegations of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Letitia James faced charges tied to a mortgage fraud inquiry . Both indictments were signed exclusively by Halligan, whom the judge described as the “driving force” behind the prosecutions. Trump had publicly demanded legal action against both officials, posting on Truth Social that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” He has long regarded Comey as an adversary, dating back to the Russia investigation he oversaw before Trump fired him in 2017.

Justices Flávio Dino, Cristiano Zanin and Carmen Lúcia joined Moraes in upholding the decision, ending more than 100 days of house arrest for the former leader. Bolsonaro, 70, is awaiting final appeals against his 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva . Bolsonaro was arrested early Saturday after authorities said he reportedly used a soldering iron to tamper with his court-mandated ankle monitor . The breach occurred just hours before supporters were expected to gather outside his home — a gathering Justice Moraes warned could disrupt police monitoring. In Sunday testimony, Bolsonaro said he had suffered a “nervous breakdown” caused by a change in medication, leading to “paranoia and hallucination” when he attempted to break the device. He denied any intention to flee . Justice Dino rejected that argument in his written vote: \"The admitted breach of electronic monitoring not only increases the risk of escape but also indicates a blatant violation of the precautionary measures imposed by the Judiciary.” Moraes, who issued the arrest warrant, wrote that Bolsonaro had shown “repeated non-compliance with precautionary measures” and “evident disrespect to the court,” noting that the former president himself acknowledged tampering with the device. According to case documents, authorities detected interference with Bolsonaro’s ankle monitor at 12:08 a.m. on Saturday, prompting the arrest order hours later.

The incident has sparked concerns over China’s repeated challenges to India’s territorial claims. Prema Wangjom Thongdok, who was en route from London to Japan on 21 November, said her scheduled three-hour stopover turned into a harrowing experience after immigration officers declared her passport “invalid” simply because it mentioned Arunachal Pradesh as her birthplace. Thongdok, whose family is from Rupa in the West Kameng district, alleged that Chinese authorities insisted that Arunachal Pradesh “belongs to China” and pressured her to acknowledge their claim before they would continue processing her transit. In a detailed post on X on Sunday, she claimed, “I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hours on 21st November 2025 by China immigration and China Eastern Airlines.

Trump did not provide details on what prompted his optimism, and neither Washington nor Kyiv immediately commented on the message. His remarks, however, come amid renewed diplomatic activity involving US, Ukrainian and European officials, who have been working to narrow differences over competing proposals for a potential peace framework. The Russia-Ukraine conflict , now in its third year, has escalated pressure on all sides as Russia continues battlefield advances and Ukraine faces mounting political strains.

The assessment will be done on a case-to-case basis and the details of the study are expected within 45 days. Mint had earlier reported that the power ministry has asked renewable energy implementation agencies to cancel projects for which PSAs and PPAs have not been signed. The ministry of new and renewable energy had on 4 November said that any cancellation would take place in a phased manner only after all viable options for executing power sale and purchase pacts are fully explored. The ministry of new and renewable energy had earlier this month said that PSAs and PPAs have not been signed for nearly 43.94 GW of awarded capacity. The issue is significant, as prolonged delays risk slowing India’s plan to add 50 GW of renewable capacity each year to reach 500GW by 2030 and advance toward its net-zero target by 2070. Power developers sign PPAs with procurers or the renewable energy implementation agencies (REIA), who further sign PSAs with power distribution companies (discoms). Many discoms have chosen to wait for tariffs to go lower, rather than sign PSAs, holding up the whole process.

The 24-hour average AQI remained at 382, placing the city in the ‘very poor’ category for the 11th consecutive day. According to the CPCB data, the average AQI stood at 391 on Sunday, 370 on Saturday, 374 on Friday, 391 on Thursday, 392 on Wednesday, 374 on Tuesday and 351 on Monday. The CPCB's Sameer app, which provides real-time air quality readings from all monitoring stations in Delhi, indicated that 15 out of 38 active stations recorded ‘severe’ air quality on Monday. These included locations such as ITO, Punjabi Bagh, Patparganj, Ashok Vihar, Sonia Vihar, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Narela and Bawana, among others, where AQI levels exceeded 400. According to CPCB standards, AQI levels are classified as follows: 0–50 – good, 51–100 – satisfactory, 101–200 – moderate, 201–300 – poor, 301–400 – very poor, and 401–500 – severe. Meanwhile, the Decision Support System (DSS) of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, estimated that vehicular emissions contributed 21.6% to Delhi’s pollution on Monday, making it the highest pollutant source, while stubble burning accounted for 1.8%. For Tuesday, these contributions are projected at 21% and 1.6%, respectively. Satellite imagery detected three farm fires in Punjab, one in Haryana and 522 in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday. Meanwhile, the minimum temperature was recorded at 9.3 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal, while the maximum settled at 26.1 degrees Celsius, 0.6 degrees above normal, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). For Tuesday, the IMD has forecast moderate fog, with maximum and minimum temperatures expected to hover around 24°C and 9°C, respectively.

Madison police issued an alert Sunday after Geyser, now 23, was last seen around 8 p.m. Saturday with an adult acquaintance. She was located early Monday at a truck stop in Posen, Illinois, about 25 miles south of Chicago. Posen police said Geyser was found with a 42-year-old man who was arrested on charges of criminal trespassing and obstructing identification. He has since been released. Geyser was moved to the group home earlier this year after a judge granted her conditional release from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute. She had been committed there since 2018 after pleading guilty to attempted first-degree intentional homicide under a deal that allowed her to avoid prison. Prosecutors had strongly opposed her release, arguing Geyser remained a risk. “She couldn’t be trusted,” they told the court at the time. According to Madison police, authorities weren’t informed she was missing until nearly 12 hours after she left the group home. The Department of Corrections received an alert Saturday night that Geyser’s ankle monitor had malfunctioned. About two hours later, staff at the group home confirmed she was gone and had removed the device. The agency issued an apprehension request just after midnight, but Madison police said they didn’t learn of her disappearance until the following morning when the group home called. The DOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. State health officials had attempted to block her release in March, raising concerns about her behavior and reading material. They told the judge Geyser had read Rent Boy, a novel involving murder and organ trafficking, without discussing it with her therapy team. They also alleged she had communicated with a man who", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/slender-man-stabbing-attacker-morgan-geyser-caught-in-illinois-after-fleeing-wisconsin-group-home-11763996593617.html", "timestamp": 1764044947.1369674}

In a statement on X, the NWS posted: “Bottom Line, Up Front: The central US could see cooler than normal temperatures Thanksgiving week while areas of the west and Florida could see above normal temperatures.”  The agency added that below-normal temperatures are likely across the Central and Northern US, including the Pacific Northwest, Great Plains, northern Texas and parts of the Mid-Atlantic, beginning November 25 and increasing in intensity from November 26–30. A cross-country storm could disrupt the Thanksgiving travel plans of millions, AccuWeather meteorologists warned. As the storm sweeps east, it will bring heavy rain, thunderstorms, snow and strong winds across the central, southern and eastern US. The American Automobile Association (AAA) expects a record 82 million people to travel 50 miles or more this Thanksgiving — raising the stakes for a potentially chaotic week on the roads and at major airports. “Are you one of the 80+ million planning to travel for Thanksgiving this year?” NWS urged. “Be sure to add ‘check the weather forecast at weather.gov’ to your to-do list!”  One of the biggest impacts will come from an atmospheric river hitting the Pacific Northwest, bringing heavy rain, flooding, mountain snow and gusty winds from Tuesday into Thanksgiving Day , as per AccuWeather. “The heavy rain from the atmospheric river will likely slow travel on Interstate 5 leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday,” said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

From ‘AI-generated’ becoming part of our modern lexicon to ChatGPT, Face ID and Turnitin being just some examples of AI-powered technologies used practically everyday, AI is well and truly here – but what exactly is AI and how can you use it to work smarter? Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

From the AI boom to the 2024 Budget, employees in 2025 will need to be more strategic than they’ve ever been to get, and stay ahead, in their respective industries. According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025. With the growth of generative AI (thanks in part to the launch of ChatGPT) in the workplace in 2024, the increasing need for cybersecurity professionals and general digital literacy, tech continues to be one of 2025’s top sectors according to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Future of Jobs 2025 report. An estimated 60% of employers expect that increasing digital access will transform their businesses by 2030.

This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764044975.2269866}
