The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers. But the rise of IIT Bombay was also inseparable from the city that housed it, a city whose own history of names reflects centuries of shifting rule, culture, and political imagination.

The restriction on recruitment under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Reservation of Seats in Education Institutions and Appointments of Posts and Services under the State) Act, 2022, will remain until further orders. However, the HC bench allowed the government to continue recruitment processes already notified before November 19, 2025, even if they follow the increased reservation percentages. The court also clarified that all appointments made through these ongoing recruitments will be subject to the final outcome of the petitions challenging the law. The division bench of Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C M Poonacha issued the interim order on November 27 while hearing two PILs filed by Mahendra Kumar Mitra of Raichur and Mahesh of Bengaluru . The petitions question the constitutional validity of the 2022 Act, particularly the hike in SC/ST reservation, from 15 per cent to 17 per cent for SCs and from 3 per cent to 7 per cent for STs. Other Backward Classes (OBCs) reservation continues to remain at 32 per cent, which takes over all reservations in the state to 56 per cent. The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters. The government had earlier argued that halting ongoing recruitments would disrupt administrative functioning due to manpower shortages.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students.

Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

Sangma announced the release of the second and final instalment of the Umbrella Post Matric Scholarship , amounting to ₹130 crore, for nearly 70,000 students for the 2024-25 academic year on Friday. The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government. He announced that reforms to address long-standing issues faced by ad hoc and SSA teachers are nearing completion and could be implemented in the next financial year. The program also included participation from thousands of students virtually joining from 200 locations across the state.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021. Underlining the relevance of a single higher education regulator, the NEP-2020 document says, “The regulatory system needs a complete overhaul to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.” It adds that the new system should ensure the distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting are ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/winter-session-parliament-to-take-up-bill-replacing-ugc-aicte-ncte-with-single-regulator-10381204/", "timestamp": 1764761167.3906097}

At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates. The SLST-2 examination was conducted by the state SSC in September, 2025 in the wake of the Supreme Court previously scrapping the entire 2016 teachers recruitment panel on grounds of large scale corruption. Following the publication of the written test results and follow-up interview calls for shortlisted candidates for recruitment to classes 11-12 in state-run and -aided schools earlier this month, large scale protests were held by fresh candidates who took to the streets alleging the SSC’s granting of ‘experience marks’ to the now out-of-job untainted 2016 candidates was “unfair” and thwarted their qualification chances for the next stage. The SSC is yet to publish the results for the tests of teachers’ recruitment to classes 9-10, where it is likely to follow the same marking pattern. While passing Thursday’s order, Justice Sinha further directed that, in the meantime, it will be open for the petitioners to approach the apex court for further necessary relief, in accordance", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/calcutta-high-court-defers-decision-awarding-marks-teaching-experience-in-slst-2025-await-supreme-court-ruling-wbtet-10378774/", "timestamp": 1764761170.9291549}

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category. It sought a direction to the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education and School Federation of India Games to schedule the annual sports calendar (including all zonal, inter-zonal, state, and national tournaments, trials and coaching camps) for all outdoor sports in the capital during safer and less susceptible months with verifiably better ambient air quality. The petitioners said at the time of filing the plea, the city was under the Grade Response Action Plan-III (GRAP-III) emergency plan and risked escalation to GRAP-IV.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

The new goal is to create interfaces and modalities that make it easier for users to create a habit of logging their meals or workouts, along with having an ever-present AI assistant that can guide people in areas like nutrition and exercise. Khosla-backed health startup Healthify on Tuesday launched a new version of its health assistant Ria, which you can converse with live, via voice, and by using the camera for getting input about your food. The startup is using OpenAI’s tech to power this conversational mode. With this release, Ria supports more than 50 languages, including 14 Indian languages. The company said that it can also support mixed language input like Hinglish or Spanglish. While the company is largely utilizing OpenAI’s models for this release, it said that in the future it could use other models if needed. Through the new version of Ria, users can ask for their health overview for specified time frames like day, week, or month, or an overall summary. The app can pull data from different sources like fitness trackers, sleep trackers, or glucose monitors to give users insights about exercise, sleep, readiness, and glucose spikes, and give suggestions. Just like Google Gemini’s Live Conversation mode, you can point the camera to ask about different food items and their nutritional value, then log them. Healthify also showed off a demo of using Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to converse with Ria in real time and use the device’s camera to log food. The startup believes its users will feel more comfortable chatting in real time with an assistant. Plus, they can do multiple things in one session, such as getting insights, generating an exercise plan, or logging their goals. If you forget to log your food for the day, you can describe your meals in one go instead of typing them out, and the assistant will log them for you.

The unsurprising theme is AI for the enterprise, although this year it’s all about upgrades that give its customers greater control to customize AI agents — including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the announcements that got our attention. TechCrunch will continue to update this article through the end of AWS re:Invent, so be sure to check back. AWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%. AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform . One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.

Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services. The idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware. If that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, both companies say . In this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool. Interestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers to run OpenAI workloads.

Just like many of Bending Spoons’ previous acquisitions, including Evernote, Meetup, Vimeo, and AOL, Eventbrite has a strong brand, but the company’s business has stopped growing, according to audited financials. The events marketplace and ticketing company was co-founded in 2006 by the husband-and-wife team Julia and Kevin Hartz, and Renaud Visage. During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised approximately $330 million in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management. Unlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at $11 billion . Besides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as “venture zombie” companies. These firms include Constellation Software, Curious , Tiny , SaaS.group , Arising Ventures , and Calm Capital . Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys “great companies” at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins . Audited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite’s trailing 12 months’ revenue of $295 million. Despite this seemingly low revenue multiple, Eventbrite stockholders will receive $4.50 in cash per share, an 81% premium over the previous day’s $2.48 closing price.

That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface. Google calls this conversational feature AI Mode . It launched to U.S. users this May , and to global users this August, allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT. However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual. But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead. Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.

Each of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now. Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time. Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.” As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently. “You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday. “It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said. Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention.

He wasn’t joking . This time, we’ve got Nicholas Kelez , a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech.

An tares says it is targeting commercial, defense, and space-based applications with its R1 microreactor, which will produce between 100 kilowatts and 1 megawatt of electricity. The design uses TRISO fuel, which in Antares case is spheres of carbon- and ceramic-coated uranium embedded in graphite. The startup is one of several companies that have benefited recently from renewed interest in nuclear power over the last six months. Last week, Amazon-backed X-energy said it had raised a $700 million Series D round , which came on the heels of an upsized $700 million Series C that closed in February. The company is also designing a reactor around TRISO fuel. Deep Fission, which had struggled to raise money as recently as April, went public in a $30 million reverse merger in September. Aalo Atomics raised $100 million in August to build a demonstration data center powered by a microreactor, and in June, Nvidia contributed to a $650 million round for TerraPower, a small modular reactor startup also backed by Bill Gates. Big nuclear plants have been given a second chance, too.

Over a decade later, I found myself in a disturbingly similar situation. I watched Grimes perform on Sunday before yet another drug-addled man. But this time, her DJ set was part of a public livestream for Bryan Johnson, an investor and entrepreneur who had taken a hefty 5.24 gram dose of psilocybin mushrooms to see if psychedelics could aid him in his quest for immortality. Bryan Johnson — who made his millions selling his finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He publicly documents each step of his process on social media, including getting plasma transfusions from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and injecting Botox into his genitals.

Players with a Netflix subscription can now download the game, which features mobile-friendly controls, including touch-screen shooting and navigation. It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available. Originally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.  The inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has faced challenges in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when estimates revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year. Red Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise. The launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of games on smart TVs in October.

According to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia , ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday. However, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%. The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session. Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year. In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app. Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase.

The first version of AWS Nova was announced last year at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service. “The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.” The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding. Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images.

Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected.

The initial rollout of these features is in partnership with the popular video game Marvel Rivals, which now has a dedicated store page within the game’s official Discord server. Marvel Rivals is a smart choice for this launch, as it garnered 10 million players within 72 hours of its release last year, generated over $100 million in its first month, and has built a community of more than 4 million members on Discord. Players can now browse and purchase in-game items directly from the Marvel Rivals server, which includes items such as bundles, costumes, emotes, and emojis. Additionally, users can create wishlists that friends can view and purchase as gifts.

While YouTube has offered a YouTube Music recap for the past few years, the platform announced on Tuesday that it’s now launching a separate experience for videos watched on the main service. YouTube Recap features up to 12 personalized cards that highlight a user’s top channels, interests, the evolution of their viewing habits, and personality-type assignment based on their watching preferences. For instance, the “Skill Builder” personality type goes to users who are drawn to content that helps develop skills, while “Sunshiners” gravitate toward content that spreads positivity. “Trailblazers” watch content that’s original and challenges the norm. Other personality types include the “Wonder Seeker,” the “Connector,” and the “Dreamer,” among others. Users will also be able to see their top artists and songs of the year, but they can get deeper insights in the YouTube Music app with their annual YouTube Music Recap, which started rolling out last week. Recap is available starting today for YouTube users in North America, with a global rollout coming this week. Users can find their Recap directly on the YouTube homepage or under the “You” tab. Recaps are accessible on mobile devices and desktop. YouTube says the new feature was requested by users and that it conducted over 50 different concept tests before landing on the final product. Alongside the launch of Recap, YouTube also released trend charts showcasing the top creators, podcasts, and songs of the year. MrBeast took the No. 1 spot for top creator for the sixth year in a row. The top podcast spot went to “The Joe Rogan Experience,” while Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga took the No. 1 spot for top song with “Die with a Smile.” YouTube Recap arrives the same day as Apple Music’s Replay and Amazon Music’s 2025 Delivered .

Here's what we want to know.", "content": "A cybersecurity incident at analytics provider Mixpanel announced just hours before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend could set a new standard for how not to announce a data breach. To recap: In a bare bones blog post last Wednesday, Mixpanel chief executive Jen Taylor announced that the company had detected an unspecified security incident on November 8 that affected some of its customers, but didn’t say how they were affected, nor how many, only that Mixpanel had taken a range of security actions to “eradicate unauthorized access.” Mixpanel’s CEO, Jen Taylor, did not respond to multiple emails from TechCrunch, which included over a dozen questions about the company’s data breach. We asked Taylor if the company had received any communication from the hackers, such as a demand for money, along with other specific questions about the breach, including whether Mixpanel employee accounts were protected with multi-factor authentication . One of its affected customers is OpenAI, which published its own blog post two days later, confirming what Mixpanel had failed to explicitly say in its own post, that customer data had been taken from Mixpanel’s systems. OpenAI said it was affected by the breach because it relied on software provided by Mixpanel to help understand how OpenAI users interact with certain parts of its website, such as its developer documentation . OpenAI users affected by the Mixpanel breach are likely to be developers whose own apps or websites rely on OpenAI’s products to work. OpenAI said its stolen data included the user’s provided name, email addresses, their approximate location (such as city and state) based on their IP address, and some identifiable device data, such as the operating system and browser version. Some of this information is the same kind of data that Mixpanel collects from people’s devices as they use apps and browse websites. For its part, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix told TechCrunch that the breached data taken from Mixpanel ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/a-data-breach-at-analytics-giant-mixpanel-leaves-a-lot-of-open-questions/", "timestamp": 1764761465.0904837}

Last year’s event was largely focused on their AI efforts , including new foundation models, services tackling AI hallucinations , and new security measures . And this year is likely to follow suit, based on what Amazon has announced so far and the lineup of speakers and programming that you can explore in more detail below. The event formally kicks off this morning, December 2, at 8 a.m. PT.

The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart. Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company. Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99. Orders below $15 will include a small-basket fee of $1.99. Customers in Seattle and Philadelphia can now check the Amazon app and homepage and look for the “30-Minute Delivery” option in the navigation bar to see if it’s available in their area. After placing an order, customers can track their deliveries and tip drivers through the app. “Amazon is utilizing specialized smaller facilities designed for efficient order fulfillment, strategically placed close to where Seattle- and Philadelphia-area customers live and work,” Amazon explained in a blog post . “This approach prioritizes the safety of employees picking and packing orders, reduces the distance delivery partners need to travel, and enables faster delivery times.” The move follows Amazon’s launch of a 15-minute delivery service in the United Arab Emirates in October. The company said at the time that some customers received their orders in as little as six minutes. The launch of the new service marks Amazon’s latest effort to enter the fast delivery market in the United States. In 2014, the e-commerce giant introduced a “Prime Now” service that offered one-hour deliveries, but the company discontinued it in 2021.

But it sure is nice to get more for that penny, especially when you’re leveling up for a new mattress and bedding. Investing in a new mattress, pillow, or even just a quilt and sheets isn’t cheap—at least, not for the stuff you want to be buying. The good news? Tuft & Needle, a maker of mattresses, pillows, sheets and more, has coupon codes ready for you to snag so that you can get new bedding without paying top dollar for it. In this economy, that’s a relief to hear. Here’s what you can score with these Tuft & Needle discount codes right now. If you’re looking for bedding deals rather than a full-on mattress, Tuft & Needle’s bundle offer has you covered. You can get 15% off Tuft & Needle’s cotton and linen blend quilt ($220) that comes in a couple lovely colors (I’m partial to the earth red cayenne color) when you pair it with a white noise machine ($60) in your cart. Tuft & Needle has the Snooz sound machine available on its site, which is one of the many sound machines we like . One of the most subtle ways to get a more restful sleep is often a great pillow , and we love the supportive pillow options from Tuft & Needle. The Tuft & Needle Zip Comfort Pillow is an adjustable pillow that allows you to choose between soft, medium, and firm feels by zipping or unzipping the two zippers along the side to adjust to your comfort level. If you’re looking for something more traditional, the Original Foam Pillow stays cool throughout the night and conforms to your head and neck for a better night’s sleep.And my favorite, the Body Pillow , which is ideal for side sleepers with cradling support throughout the body.

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug. The five-and-a-half-hour livestream, which has been viewed more than 1.1 million times, also featured Johnson’s 20-year-old son Talmage, whose blood he has injected in his efforts to stay young, journalist Ashlee Vance, a DJ set from Grimes, and Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff. YouTuber MrBeast, while pictured on a cartoonish poster advertising the event, did not show up, which most extremely high people would probably count as a blessing.

Not only would the streamer be adding Mad Men —a show that HBO execs infamously passed on back when Matthew Weiner was a writer on The Sopranos —but it would be presenting the period drama’s episodes in a new 4K remastering. This would, according to the press release , give “audiences and longtime Mad Men fans the opportunity to enjoy the series’ authentically crafted elements with crisp detail and enhanced visual clarity.” As it turned out, there was perhaps too much clarity. Not long after the series went live on HBO Max, a screencap began floating around social media from a scene in the Season One episode “Red in the Face,” where Roger Sterling is vomiting in front of a group of horrified Sterling Cooper clients. When it aired—and in the version still available on AMC+—seven men are onscreen, all of them wearing period-appropriate suits and ties. The HBO Max version, on the other hand, features two men who appear very out of place in 1960: crew members lurking in the background, feeding a hose to create the illusion that actor John Slattery is puking: As of this morning, some episodes were also mislabeled, so you had to click on the episode labeled “Babylon” to see Roger’s stomach-churning display. It’s the kind of moment for which Mad Men ’s own “Not great, Bob!” meme was invented. This is, unfortunately, not the first time this has happened when a classic series has changed platforms and/or formats. Most shows that originated in the 20th century were filmed in standard definition, in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio.

If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes. The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations.

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it.

The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support.

Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change.

Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR. Meanwhile, Best Buy is offering a bundle with the game The Walking Dead: Sinners & Saints for the same price of $249. That's a $20 game. But it also comes with a $50 Best Buy e-gift card.

Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them.

Norway, however, is bucking the trend—thanks to a tax incentive system that will soon be rolled back.", "content": "The slump does not stop. Tesla sales in Europe slumped again in November 2025, confirming a negative trend that has been going on for more than a year. Data reported by Reuters shows monthly registrations of Tesla automobiles—an accurate way of measuring sales—halved compared to the same month in 2024 in the continent's main markets: down 58 percent in France, minus 59 percent in Sweden, and  down 49 percent in Denmark. In Germany, where the Elon Musk -controlled automaker has its only European plant, on the outskirts of Berlin, recorded just 750 vehicles sold in October, less than half the number sold a year earlier. The big exception to this downward trend is in Norway, where registrations of Tesla cars nearly tripled, to 6,215 units. The numbers for the first 10 months of 2025 expose a structural crisis. Tesla lost about 30 percent of European sales compared to the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association , the body that groups the industry's manufacturers on the Continent. Tesla's market share in the electric car segment fell from 12.6 percent in May 2024 to 7.2 percent in May 2025, according to analysis by Schmidt Automotive. Volkswagen took the lead among electric vehicle manufacturers by selling 133,465 units in the first six months of the year versus Tesla's 108,878, and Chinese manufacturer BYD sold more than twice as many cars as its US rival in October. The reasons for the decline are many. Musk's political stances have alienated a significant portion of his European customer base, particularly in Germany where the entrepreneur has publicly supported Alternative für Deutschland, Germany's far-right party known as AfD. Musk's virtual participation in an AfD election rally in January 2025, during which he called on Germans to overcome guilt over their Nazi past, triggered a wave of boycotts.

Both the regular frame design and the mat design are discounted to $139, though that's a larger discount for the Carver Mat since it usually retails for more. The Carver Mat is prettier with its mat-style frame, and both Carver designs sit in landscape mode only but can show portrait-oriented photos side-by-side. You can also get the holiday exclusive Stone version of the Carver , with a more textured frame, on sale for $149.

Check out our guides to the best backpacking tents and best car camping tents for more details. Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. It's not without its quirks ( read the pitching tips ), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat. It's well ventilated for a single-walled tent, with the ability to raise up the front door when weather is nice. I also like that it only needs one trekking pole (or one pole if you don't hike with trekking poles). You'd be hard-pressed to find a tent even half this nice at this price.

The first significant snowfall of the year just hit much of the country, from Philly to Boston to Kansas City . But not only will grilling season be back very soon, but the holidays are also actually a great time to cook outdoors , since smoking a big piece of meat leaves your oven free for sides. Which is why we're scoping some sales on our favorite grills this Cyber Monday. Most of the products on our list of the best grills are currently marked with some type of discount, though many of them have been priced that way for a while. Among the ones actually discounted, you find the T raeger Woodridge Pro that we reviewed very positively below $1,000 on Amazon , which is $200 off the price we normally see it at. Amazon has a ton of other big Traeger discounts , too, including $100 off the budget Pro Series 22 and $130 off the larger Pro 34 , which has 800-plus inches of cooking area. Traeger Amazon Home Depot You'll see a lot of sales marked for Weber products like the classic Original Kettle , but it's actually been selling for $142 for a long time, according to our tracking. You can probably wait for spring on that one. However, Recteq is another brand offering the biggest discounts we've seen recently. The Flagship 1600 is a smoker and grill with massive grate space (1600 square inches, as the name implies) and has impressive specs, including the ability to go low and slow for 40 hours nonstop with a full hopper. It also has wifi connectivity and can get up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit for searing steaks and burgers. The Cyber Monday price is $1,250 , the lowest we've tracked, and it's often sold for its full $1,600 list price. The more modestly priced kettle-shaped Recteq RT-B380 is also the cheapest we've seen it at $425.

(I know because I've been looking for days, with the assistance of my Pokémon-collecting friend whom I appreciate very much for his help.) Any such discounts are few and far between, and sell out almost immediately thanks to our old friends, the scalpers (shakes fist). Check your local card shops for cards that aren't priced scarily high over MSRP. But if you're shopping for a Pokémon fan, there are still some Cyber Monday discounts worth perusing that'll make great gifts, and I've rounded them up below. We haven't hand-tested everything in this list, but we know WIRED readers are searching for Pokémon gifts. For additional discounts on hand-tested gear, check our list of the very best Cyber Monday deals . Jazwares Amazon Backpack clips and bag charms aren't going away anytime soon. This little Pikachu Squishmallow can be clipped onto either, and might I say that it'd look mighty fine attached to a stocking on the morning of a certain holiday? I can attest to the clip's durability—I have a similar plush charm from the brand that I've toted to music festivals across the country. It's still going strong despite putting it through situations no keychain should be forced to endure. Lite Brite Amazon This Lite Brite comes with six Pokémon-themed templates and 1,000 pegs for endless creativity. ColourPop Amazon Reviewer Louryn Strampe has loved ColourPop since 2014, and this themed lip balm automatically adjusts to a rosy pink shade that'll suit any skin color.

Aside from potentially dissuading porch pirates and would-be burglars, security cameras are a good way to check in on your kids and pets, and add motion lighting to outside areas. Many of our favorite indoor security cameras , outdoor security cameras , and video doorbells are on sale. If you seek a wider selection of discounts, check out our Very Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup. Arlo Amazon Best Buy Arlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and direct Wi-Fi connection, and the Pro 5S is my pick of the best outdoor security cameras . The Arlo app is swift to load, offers rich notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. TP-Link Amazon B&H TP-Link As my top pick of the best indoor security cameras , the Tapo C120 has everything. It records video at up to 2K resolution, supports two-way audio (with a slight lag), and supports up to 512-GB microSD cards for local recording. There's impressive color night vision, on-device smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) without a subscription, and it even has an IP66 rating, which means you can also use it outdoors (provided you can run the power cable). We like this camera at its usual price (it hovers around $35), so this is a deal worth bagging. Nest Amazon Walmart Google Best Buy Doorbells don’t get smarter than this, and the Nest Doorbell tops our best video doorbells guide.

Sony's console comes with one controller, but since Sony's Dual Sense Controller ($55) is also on sale right now, I'd snag another one. There are discounts on quite a few PS bundles, too.

Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more. Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

{"id": "dd61204a634eb1ef4aaab2bc705ee533", "title": "Quote of the day by Barack Obama", "summary": "", "content": "\"We are the change that we seek.\" This quote is often attributed to a speech he delivered in Chicago on February 5, 2008, pivots from passive hope to active responsibility. Obama argued we cannot wait for others or perfect moments; ordinary citizens hold the transformative power. Change originates within, through collective action, not external saviors. Before politics, Obama worked as a community organizer in Chicago's South Side, helping residents fight joblessness and poverty. He knocked on doors, listened to struggles, and mobilized neighbors toward tangible improvements. Born 1961 in Hawaii to a Kenyan father and American mother, Obama rose from relative obscurity to become America's first Black president. He served two terms (2009-2017), navigating financial collapse, two wars, and healthcare transformation. His memoir and oratory shaped modern political discourse profoundly. Affordable Care Act expanded health coverage to 20 million uninsured Americans. Economic stimulus pulled the nation from recession. He authorized operation that killed Osama bin Laden. Paris Climate Agreement commitment demonstrated environmental leadership. First African American presidency itself redefined American possibility and inspired global movements toward equity and representation. Today's fractured landscape tempts withdrawal and despair. Yet oligarchic capture, climate crisis, and polarization demand precisely what Obama urged: collective mobilization from ordinary people. Populism rises when citizens feel unheard; his message reasserts that engagement, though unglamorous, remains democracy's engine.

{"id": "2026c2d6ab3b80bfc3f07c7a1a4fb564", "title": "5 exercises that can relieve joint pain", "summary": "", "content": "Movement feeds cartilage with nutrients and keeps tendons and ligaments flexible. It also calms pain signals and improves balance. The goal is less stiffness and better function, not perfection. Small daily sessions work. Warm up first. If pain spikes, cut the range, not the habit.​ Gently move joints through comfortable arcs. Example: shoulder circles, knee bends and straightens, ankle pumps, wrist open and close. Do 8 to 10 slow reps. This keeps mobility, reduces morning stiffness, and prepares muscles for strength work. Easy to do daily at home.​ Sit with legs straight. Tighten the front thigh muscle. Hold 5 to 10 seconds. Relax. Do 10 reps each leg, twice daily. This supports the kneecap and lowers pain without joint motion. Helpful for knee osteoarthritis. Build holds over weeks.​ Lie on your back, knees bent, feet hip width. Squeeze glutes and lift hips until the body is a straight line. Hold 2 seconds. Lower slowly. Do 8 to 12 reps. Strong hips unload the knee and support walking and stairs.​ Stand facing a wall. One leg back for calf stretch 20 seconds. Switch sides. For hamstrings, place heel on a step. Hinge forward with a straight back 20 seconds. Never bounce. Flexible calves and hamstrings reduce knee and back strain.​ Choose walking, cycling, or water exercise for 20 to 30 minutes most days. You should be able to talk while moving. Cardio lowers stiffness, improves mood, and helps weight control which eases joint load. Start with 10 minutes and build up.​ ​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/5-exercises-that-can-relieve-joint-pain/slideshow/125741389.cms", "timestamp": 1764761513.437914}

Vicky Kaushal , known for his intense physical roles, has surprised fans by revealing a gentler, grounded side of his fitness journey. People are paying attention to his change in lifestyle not because it's loud, but because it's honest. Vicky now begins his day before sunrise , not with cardio bursts or weightlifting , but with twenty minutes of seated meditation. The calm on his face in a recent photo says more than any gym flex he isn’t training just the body anymore; he’s training the mind to stay centered. His workouts have taken a fresh direction . He now does mobility flows , stability drills, and low-impact strength routines in addition to just lifting heavy. His trainer notes that this shift has made him more agile and more connected to his body than ever. What stands out is how he has made routine the hero of his lifestyle . The intensity of his sessions now depends on how his body feels that day. What doesn’t change is his presence—he shows up, with focus, every single time. A Diet That Reflects Mindful Living Vicky's meals have changed in the same way. Lunch plates often have simple home-cooked sabzi , dal, and rice, along with hydration rituals that he never misses. He avoids complicated food charts and sticks to what keeps his energy stable and his digestion happy. Instead of late-night screens and chaotic schedules, he has carved space for recovery. Light stretching, soft music, and reading have replaced the rush. He sleeps better now, and he is also clearer on set. Viewers often admire the bodies actors build, but this time they admire the balance he has found. The comments on his latest lifestyle post reflect something new people resonate with routines that feel doable and sustainable , not extreme. Vicky's change in lifestyle shows that being healthy doesn't always mean working harder or lifting more.

Which is healthier for you?", "summary": "", "content": "A traditional matcha latte does not contain coffee; it is made by combining ground green tea powder, water, and milk. A coffee latte is made with espresso and milk. This compares a 240 millilitres cup of matcha latte and coffee latte for calories, carbohydrates, protein, fat, and caffeine Coffee latte with milk only is usually around 68 to 130 kilocalories per 240 millilitres. Matcha latte ranges widely from about 110 to 240 kilocalories depending on milk and sweetener. Unsweetened options are leaner.​ Coffee latte with no sugar has about 10 to 22 grams of carbohydrates. Matcha latte often lands around 12 to 36 grams when sweetened. Unsweetened versions will be lower. Oat milk raises carbohydrates more than dairy.​ Dairy coffee latte gives roughly 4 to 10 grams of protein per cup. Dairy matcha latte is similar when milk amounts match. Plant milks without protein fortification will be lower.​ With dairy milk, fat is driven by the milk type. A 240 millilitres latte can have about 3.5 to 6 grams fat with dairy. Plant milks vary. Coconut milk raises fat. Skim milk keeps it very low.​ Matcha latte caffeine depends on powder used. A serving with 2 to 4 grams matcha can be about 40 to 80 milligrams or higher. Coffee latte from brewed coffee is usually about 80 to 100 milligrams in 240 millilitres.​ Matcha has catechins like epigallocatechin gallate which support antioxidant defences. Coffee has chlorogenic acids which also support heart and metabolic health markers. Both can be beneficial when sugar is limited.​ If you want less caffeine, pick a light matcha dose or decaf coffee. For weight goals, choose unsweetened milk, go small, and skip syrups. For antioxidants with steadier feel, matcha is gentle. For a stronger kick, coffee delivers.​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate. We also raise our EBITDA margin by 150-10bps on the margin beat.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency. HDFCLI is being very selective in tier-2/3 cities and is focusing only on top quartile of customers, based on various filters. Outlook HDFC Life (HDFCLI) has successfully worked its way to improve bancassurance as well as agency while focusing on SURU markets (semi-urban and rural) in FY24. This has led to 13% YoY growth in tier 2/3 locations while overall NoP has grown 11% YoY in FY24.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The Court ordered the State to provide free medical treatment to Sunali due to her pregnancy. The case has been scheduled for further examination on 12 December.

This programme aims to streamline property transactions, curb unauthorized constructions, and support urban planning as the population grows.", "content": "This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Even as India’s rural land-mapping has progressed substantially, most urban areas lack reliable, up-to-date maps and clear ownership data. This gap leads to land disputes, inefficient property transactions, poor municipal tax collection and delays in infrastructure planning. With over 600 million people expected to live in Indian cities by 2031, the central government implemented the NAKSHA (National Geospatial Knowledge-based Land Survey of Urban Habitations) programme to modernize and digitize India’s urban land records, which remain outdated, incomplete and often inaccurate. Once the pilot-phase survey of 157 urban local bodies, which started in February, is completed, the next phase will cover 1,000 cities, with all urban local bodies set to be surveyed within the next five years, Manoj Joshi, secretary in the Department of Land Resources, said on Wednesday. Mint explains the central government’s rationale behind implementing Naksha. What is the Naksha Programme and what does it aim to achieve? The Naksha programme leverages advanced technologies such as drone surveys, Global Navigation Satellite System mapping and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools to build precise digital land records. Using cutting-edge aerial and field survey techniques, Naksha is building a comprehensive, GIS-integrated database of urban land plots. It aims to create and update urban land records to ensure accurate and reliable documentation of land ownership. Under this initiative, citizens will receive a government-backed UrPro (Urban Property Ownership Record) Card, a digital proof of ownership that simplifies property transactions. With Naksha, people no longer need to rely on piles of paper or intermediaries to validate ownership. Why is the central government implementing Naksha specifically in urban areas?

His remarks come amid political backlash over a recent directive mandating smartphone manufacturers to pre-install the app on all new and existing devices. The controversy began after a 28 November government order required all mobile phone makers to preload the state-run Sanchar Saathi safety app on every handset sold in India. The directive also mandated pushing the app to existing devices via software updates and ensuring that it is “readily visible and accessible to end users” upon first use. Opposition leaders and digital rights advocates criticised the mandate as a potential surveillance tool, claiming the app could monitor calls and messages. Some smartphone manufacturers — including Apple, according to industry sources — reportedly expressed reservations and sought discussions with the Centre, arguing that the order was impractical in its current form. Jyotiraditya Scindia categorically rejected the allegations during Question Hour in the Lok Sabha. “Sanchar Saathi app se na snooping sambhav hai, na snooping hoga,” he said, stressing that the app is designed solely for citizen protection. The Union minister added that the government’s objective is to empower users, not intrude on their privacy: “The government want to give power in the hands of the people to help them protect themselves.” Amid the escalating row, Scindia softened the Centre’s stance on compulsory installation, clarifying on Tuesday that users are not obliged to keep the app. “If you want to delete it, then delete it,” he told reporters outside Parliament. He emphasised that the app remains inactive unless the user chooses to register, countering claims of covert surveillance.

Earlier in September 2025, former JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna has approached the Karnataka High Court appealing against his conviction in a rape case. A special court that convicted Prajwal Revanna last month had sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life and imposed fines, in one of the four sexual abuse and rape cases against him. The Special Court for MPs/MLAs, Judge Santosh Gajanan Bhat, who sentenced the convicted politician under various sections of the IPC on August 2, had imposed a total fine of ₹ 11.50 lakh on him, and had said ₹ 11.25 lakh from this fine amount will be paid to the victim. Revanna, who was arrested in May last year after returning from Germany, is contesting the verdict on several grounds, including what he claims are contradictions in the survivor's testimony and inconsistencies in the evidence produced by the prosecution. The case in which Prajwalb Revanna has been sentenced pertains to the one involving 48-year-old woman who was working as a help at the family's Gannikada farmhouse in Hassan district's Holenarasipura. She was allegedly raped twice -- at Hassan farm house and Bengaluru residence-- in 2021 and the act was recorded by the accused on his mobile phone. The allegations against the 34-year-old former Indian MP first came to light in 2023 after hundreds of explicit videos featuring him started circulating on social media, causing outrage across the country. Revanna had denied the charges. Prajwal Revanna is a grandson of former Indian Prime Minister, H D Deve Gowda , whose Janata Dal (Secular) party is allied with current Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP.

The Tennessee 7th Congressional District result is underway, as the special election has become unexpectedly competitive, with Democrats throwing a strong challenge to the Republican stronghold. Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate, faced massive competition from his Democratic opponent, Aftyn Behn, in the election, which is being viewed across the country as an early indicator of voter sentiment as the US approaches the 2026 midterm polls. Early indicators cited by The New York Times show Democratic candidate Aftyn Behn leading the table with 52.5% votes as thousands of voters went out to cast their ballots in an election that many view could flip the deep red state in favour of the Democrats. Polls closed in the evening on Tuesday, 2 December, for the special election, which took place after Republican Rep Mark Green resigned this summer. The Tennessee election results today are expected to be declared soon. The Tennessee 7th Congressional District election saw a surprise surge of spending in recent weeks, flooding the airwaves and filling residents' mailboxes with campaign flyers. Republican candidate Matt Van Epps was backed by a funding of $1 million from MAGA Inc in its first spending in a campaign since last year's presidential race. The Trump-supporting super PAC's willingness to spend that money is a reflection of this contest's outsize importance.

Is India impacted, and what happens next?", "content": "The Donald Trump administration has imposed an immediate pause on all immigration applications filed by nationals of 19 countries previously placed under a US travel ban, triggering widespread cancellations of green card interviews and naturalisation ceremonies. The move, confirmed by senior officials and reported by The New York Times on Tuesday, marks one of the broadest immigration slowdowns in recent years and deepens the administration’s post-attack security crackdown. The suspension comes days after two National Guard members were shot near the White House in Washington, an incident authorities have linked to Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan man who obtained asylum in April. In response, the administration announced sweeping new vetting measures and signalled that further restrictions could follow. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) spokesperson Matthew Tragesser defended the decision. “The Trump administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” NYT quoted Tragesser. “We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake.” The pause applies only to people from the 19 nations previously included in the June travel ban, which reportedly covers Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Haiti, Somalia, Venezuela and several other low-income or conflict-affected countries. India is not on the travel-ban list and is therefore not impacted by this application pause. Indian applicants for US green cards, H-1B visa adjustments, American citizenship, and other immigration benefits should not experience cancellations tied to this specific policy change.

Polling ends at 7 pm CT (8:00 pm ET) on 2 December (local time). Gates of all polling centres will be closing by 7 pm. However, those who have reached the queue on or before 7 pm will be permitted to cast their votes. There are around 466,000 registered voters who will be casting their votes in the election. Some of the major cities that fall under the 7th Congressional district are Clarksville, Franklin and some ares of Nashville. The nominee for the Republican Party is Matt Vap Eps, who hopes to capitalise on the voter base of Mark Green. On the other hand, competing from the Democratic Party is Aftyn Behn. Voters can locate their polling stations from a website called GoVoteTN . Once you enter your address on this website, it will show you the nearest polling station. Mail-in ballots are accepted in Tennessee, but they have to sent in by election day, i.e., Tuesday. If they do not reach the election offices by end of polling on Tuesday, these votes would not be considered eligible. Although the seat was vacated by a Republican, experts are predicting a tight race this time around. Emerson College conducted a poll to check which candidate is the most favoured, and Republican Matt Vap Epps edged out his opponent by 2 percentage points. The poll also found that 5 per cent of voters are undecided, and their votes could swing the election in favour of either candidate. If the Republican Party loses, it will be an embarrassment for them since Tennessee is traditionally a red state.

The board of India's stock market regulator will take up the most sweeping revision of regulations in decades spanning mutual funds, stock brokers and its own officials later this month, two people aware of the meeting's agenda said. The board will discuss bringing in new rules, updating outdated rules, and removing overlapping ones. In October, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) proposed to cap brokerage and transaction costs that mutual funds charge beyond annual fees collected under their total expense ratio (TER). Sebi also proposed to scrap the additional five basis points charged over the exit load and a more comprehensive disclosure of the TER, which is used to cover management and operating costs. “Mutual fund regulations and stock broker norms will definitely be part of the Sebi agenda,\" one of the two people cited above said on the condition of anonymity. The regulator's board will meet on 17 December. A Sebi spokesperson did not respond to Mint's queries. The proposed overhaul of mutual fund regulations aims to improve transparency in costs and charges levied by mutual funds; however, the regulator's October suggestions drew criticism from asset management companies (AMC), who claim lower brokerage will squeeze income, affect research work, and lead to loss of block deals from brokers. Meanwhile, mutual fund distributors worry that AMCs will pass on some of the pain, shrinking their own income. \"If the recommendations on brokerage costs are accepted as it is, then it would have an impact on AMCs. But we are expecting Sebi to come mid-way,\" an AMC official said on the condition of anonymity.

Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District — a long-standing Republican stronghold — faces an unexpectedly competitive special election tonight, in a race viewed nationally as an early indicator of voter sentiment heading into the 2026 midterms. Although Republican nominee Matt Van Epps remains the evidently favourite, Democratic challenger Aftyn Behn has benefited from a year-long pattern of Democratic overperformance in special elections, raising the prospect of a significantly tighter contest than Republicans are accustomed to. The political backdrop has grown increasingly unfavourable for US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party this autumn. A declining presidential approval rating, widening Democratic leads in national generic ballot polls, and sweeping gubernatorial losses in Virginia and New Jersey have heightened GOP anxieties. Tonight’s contest adds to that pressure. The 7th District — spanning parts of Nashville, the entirety of Clarksville, and stretches of exurban and rural Middle Tennessee — has voted reliably Republican for years. Trump won it by 22 points in 2024 and 15 points in 2020. However, Democrats have been outperforming expectations in every special House election of 2025.

The moves—announced through multiple notifications over the past month—ease compliance pressures and mark a shift towards modernising India's technical rulebook, as the country expands its digital and urban infrastructure at an unprecedented pace. Fifteen QCOs were withdrawn in mid-November and another seven on Monday, many of which covered petrochemical intermediates critical for downstream industries, including plastics and polymers and textiles and apparel. The government's quality control orders mandate compliance with specific Indian Standards for certain products. Manufacturers and importers are required to obtain a Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) licence and use the BIS mark before selling the products in India. This is meant to ensure that the product is safe, consistent, and reliable for industrial use, as well as public health. As per the 1 December order, the withdrawn chemical QCOs include those for p-xylene, toluene, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, vinyl acetate monomer, ethylene dichloride and vinyl chloride monomer, which had made BIS certification mandatory since 2021. These chemicals are used to make polyester, polyethylene terephthalate packaging used in the food and beverages industry, paints and coatings, adhesives, acrylics, and pipes. An industry executive said certification for these globally-traded chemicals had proved difficult to secure after the QCO rollout and risked disrupting supply chains in polyester, plastics, adhesives and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) manufacturing. The withdrawal eases compliance for several user sectors. p-xylene is produced domestically mainly by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), though India also imports it from Kuwait, ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-pulls-back-7-more-qcos-taking-the-total-to-22-upgrades-norms-for-telecom-fibre-and-lift-safety-11764666756488.html", "timestamp": 1764761564.0716128}

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025?

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764761595.0497906}

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs.
