The move came after a marginal improvement in Delhi’s air quality, though the AQI has continued to oscillate between the “poor” and “very poor” categories. Parents and students said the reopening has brought back routine but not relief. Many expressed unease about children commuting and sitting in classrooms amid what they describe as “visible pollution”. “The AQI may have improved on paper, but the air still smells toxic. My son starts coughing the moment he steps out. I’m not fully convinced schools should have reopened so quickly,” said Mamta Agrawal, a parent from Noida. Others felt academic continuity needed priority. “Children can’t keep shifting between online and offline modes. My daughter’s focus breaks every time this happens,” said Yogendra Yadav, a parent from East Delhi . Teachers voiced concerns about classroom ventilation and preparedness. “Not all schools have air purifiers, and younger students often either forget masks or are not comfortable using them. We worry about prolonged exposure,” said Sumit Sharma, a government school teacher in North Delhi. “It’s definitely challenging for us as teachers. Online classes demand that we constantly work to keep students focused on a screen, and that itself is tiring. Now that offline classes are resuming, we have to divide our attention between students sitting in front of us and those who may still be joining remotely. Managing both formats together affects the pace of teaching, and it becomes difficult to ensure every child is engaged and learning equally,” said the Delhi government school teacher.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits. Goa marks the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in early December, a major religious observance that can lead to localised school holidays.

During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

The unsurprising theme is AI for the enterprise, although this year it’s all about upgrades that give its customers greater control to customize AI agents — including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the announcements that got our attention. TechCrunch will continue to update this article through the end of AWS re:Invent, so be sure to check back.

The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%. AWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform . One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.

Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services. The idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can’t wind up in a competitor’s or foreign adversary’s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware. If that product name sounds familiar, it should. That’s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, both companies say . In this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia’s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon’s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS’ homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock — the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool. Interestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn’t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds.

That means that users who are provided with the now common AI-generated snapshot of key information on a topic or question above their search results can choose to go deeper by asking follow-up questions in a conversational interface. Google calls this conversational feature AI Mode . It launched to U.S. users this May , and to global users this August, allowing for back-and-forth chats with Google’s Gemini AI, in an experience similar to ChatGPT. However, accessing the experience so far has required you to think ahead about what type of question you were preparing to search for. If it were a more traditional search query, or one where you could expect to get a quick answer, you’d likely stick with typing into the search box as usual. But if you expected to ask more questions or explore a topic in more detail, you’d have to click over to the AI Mode tab to start chatting with the AI instead. Google now wants to test whether or not it makes sense to differentiate the two experiences. After all, the process of information seeking can often lead to a desire to learn more. You may have thought you were starting a simple query, only to find yourself delving deeper into the topic.

Each of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now. Perhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called “Kiro autonomous agent” can work on its own for days at a time. Kiro is a software coding agent based on AWS’s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company’s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called “spec-driven development.” As Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently. “You simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,” AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday. “It actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,” he said. Amazon says Kiro maintains “persistent context across sessions.” In other words, it doesn’t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do.  It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention.

This is the final StrictlyVC event of 2025 , and truly, the lineup is ridiculous. The series has traveled around the globe under the auspices of TechCrunch. Steve Case rented a theater in Washington, D.C.; we talked to Greece’s prime minister in Athens; and Kirsten Green hosted us at the Presidio in San Francisco. The concept is always the same, though: bring together people who are working on genuinely important developments in a smaller setting, before everyone else figures out they’re important. One of our favorite moments was when, in 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed. He wasn’t joking . This time, we’ve got Nicholas Kelez , a particle accelerator physicist who spent 20 years at the Department of Energy building things that shouldn’t be possible. Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make. (More galling to some: Americans invented the technology, then sold it to Europe.) Kelez is building the next generation in America using particle accelerator tech. It’s as nerdy as it sounds but also exceedingly important in this moment. There is also growing competition chasing after the same prize . Then there’s Mina Fahmi , who’s made a ring that captures your whispered thoughts and turns them into text . Before you roll your eyes, know that he and co-founder Kirak Hong spent years at Meta working on this stuff after their company was acquired.

The round, which was led by Shine Capital with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and others, consists of $71 million in equity and $25 million in debt. An tares says it is targeting commercial, defense, and space-based applications with its R1 microreactor, which will produce between 100 kilowatts and 1 megawatt of electricity. The design uses TRISO fuel, which in Antares case is spheres of carbon- and ceramic-coated uranium embedded in graphite. The startup is one of several companies that have benefited recently from renewed interest in nuclear power over the last six months. Last week, Amazon-backed X-energy said it had raised a $700 million Series D round , which came on the heels of an upsized $700 million Series C that closed in February. The company is also designing a reactor around TRISO fuel. Deep Fission, which had struggled to raise money as recently as April, went public in a $30 million reverse merger in September. Aalo Atomics raised $100 million in August to build a demonstration data center powered by a microreactor, and in June, Nvidia contributed to a $650 million round for TerraPower, a small modular reactor startup also backed by Bill Gates. Big nuclear plants have been given a second chance, too. Earlier this month, Microsoft partner Constellation Energy received a $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island by 2028. That project is expected to cost $1.6 billion to refurbish the reactor that was idled in 2019. In October, Google said it would work with NextEra Energy to reopen a nuclear power plant in Iowa that was damaged during a torrential downpour in 2020.

Amid the crowd on that sunny afternoon, a drug-addled man continuously tried to climb a young, flimsy tree for a better view. He failed again and again — it was simply impossible for such a dainty plant to hold his weight — yet I watched in fascination and horror as this stranger fixated on a task that would only succeed if he could defy the very laws of physics. Over a decade later, I found myself in a disturbingly similar situation. I watched Grimes perform on Sunday before yet another drug-addled man. But this time, her DJ set was part of a public livestream for Bryan Johnson, an investor and entrepreneur who had taken a hefty 5.24 gram dose of psilocybin mushrooms to see if psychedelics could aid him in his quest for immortality. Bryan Johnson — who made his millions selling his finance startup Braintree — wants to live forever. He publicly documents each step of his process on social media, including getting plasma transfusions from his son, taking over 100 pills per day, and injecting Botox into his genitals. All the while, Johnson’s outlandish campaign to cheat death also functions as an advertisement for Kernel, his neurotechnology company, and Blueprint, his business that sells supplements, nut butters, and olive oil. Johnson promoted his shrooms trip as a livestream extravaganza, complete with hokey graphics resembling a Windows XP desktop. Before his trip, Johnson and his Blueprint co-founder, Kate Tolo, joked they could make this stream like the Super Bowl and sell commercials. What was once a rite of passage for a certain ilk of college kids — listening to music and getting too high — was being turned into a very public, yet remarkably uncool, experiment on stretching the bounds of humanity.

The rollout of the new Android 16 features, which are first coming to Pixel devices, marks a new chapter in how Android updates are delivered, as the company is moving from a single yearly update to more frequent releases. Android 16 is adding AI-powered notification summaries that condense long messages and group chats into quick, glanceable overviews. A new “Notification organizer” will automatically group and silence lower-priority notifications, such as promotions, news, and social alerts. The update also brings more ways to customize devices, with users getting access to custom icon shapes, themed icons, and the option to automatically darken light apps, even those that don’t have their own native dark theme. Additionally, there’s a new Parental Controls option within Android Settings that allows parents to set screen time limits, create downtime schedules, control app usage, and more for their children. These updates are starting to roll out with Android 16 on eligible Pixel devices starting Tuesday. Google is also releasing several new Android features that aren’t specific to Android 16. A new beta feature called “Call Reason” allows users to flag calls to saved contacts as “urgent.” Recipients will see this on their incoming call screen and know it’s time-sensitive. If they miss the call, the “urgent” note will stay in their call history. Google is also launching “Expressive Captions” that display the full emotion of speech with tags like [sad] or [joyful], whether it’s a video message or a post on social media. The company says this will allow users to glean the full context of what’s being said when the sound is off. The tech giant is making it easier to spot and exit unwanted group chats.

Players with a Netflix subscription can now download the game, which features mobile-friendly controls, including touch-screen shooting and navigation. It’s important to note that the game does not feature a multiplayer mode and players must be connected to the internet to play; offline gameplay is not available. Originally released by Rockstar Games in 2010, Red Dead Redemption is set in the year 1911 during the Wild West era. Players assume the role of John Marston, a former outlaw searching for his kidnapped family. The mobile version includes the stand-alone expansion pack, “Undead Nightmare,” which follows Marston as he faces a zombie outbreak.  The inclusion of Red Dead Redemption in Netflix’s gaming lineup is a significant addition to its gaming strategy, especially considering that Netflix has faced challenges in previous years with fewer than 1% of its subscriber base engaging with the available games. The company’s investment in the space finally showed signs of growth in 2024, when estimates revealed that Netflix Games downloads increased 180% year-over-year. Red Dead Redemption is one of Rockstar’s most popular franchises, second only to the iconic Grand Theft Auto series. The game has attracted a dedicated base, and some players have been speculating that a prequel might be announced soon. The newly launched mobile game could potentially generate renewed interest in the franchise. The launch comes on the heels of Netflix’s introduction of games on smart TVs in October. Subscribers can use their phones as controllers to play a collection of party titles, including Boggle Party, LEGO Party!, and Pictionary.

According to a new analysis by mobile app insights provider Apptopia , ChatGPT referrals to retailer mobile apps increased 28% year-over-year over the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend, running from Thanksgiving Day on Thursday through Sunday. However, the use of ChatGPT may not be benefiting smaller retailers as much as it’s helping to further entrench the e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart. This year, Amazon’s share of ChatGPT referrals grew to 54%, up from 40.5% in 2024. Walmart’s share, meanwhile, increased from 2.7% last year to now 14.9%. The data was collected by Apptopia’s U.S. panel, which is based on observed consumer activity on mobile devices. As it’s not first-party data, its figures are only estimates. For this analysis, the firm defined a referral session as a retail mobile app session that directly followed (within 30 seconds) a ChatGPT session. Despite the big jump from 2024, consumers’ use of AI chatbots to find e-commerce deals is still a small sliver of the overall referral market, Apptopia noted. Last year, ChatGPT’s referrals to e-commerce apps were only 0.64% of all ChatGPT sessions on Black Friday, and that figure only grew to 0.82% this year. In this case, a referral session was anytime ChatGPT either gave the searcher a shopping idea or the user clicked a link directly from their chat session that brought them to the retail app. Apptopia isn’t the only firm digging into how AI is impacting e-commerce during the busy holiday shopping season. Adobe also reported this week that AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday, and those who landed on a retail site from an AI chatbot were 38% more likely to make a purchase.

The cloud provider launched Nova 2, a fleet of four new AI models to its Nova model family, during AWS CEO Matt Garman’s AWS re:Invent keynote on Tuesday. The first version of AWS Nova was announced last year at the company’s annual tech conference. At the time, the company released four text-generating models and one image-generating model. This year, AWS is giving the models an upgrade and launching an accompanying service. “The momentum has been really fantastic,” Garman said during his Tuesday keynote. “Nova has been, has grown to be used by tens of thousands of customers today, everyone from marketing giants to tech leaders like Infosys or Blue Origin or Robinhood to innovative startups like NinjaTech AI and today, we’re making Nova even better.” The four new models include Nova 2 Lite, a more cost-effective reasoning model. Reasoning AI models “think” before they respond and can process text, images, and videos to generate text that’s meant for everyday tasks. Nova 2 Pro is a reasoning agent that can process text, images, videos and speech that is designed for “highly complex tasks” like coding. Nova 2 Sonic is a new speech-to-speech model to be used for conversational AI. Nova 2 Omni is a multimodal reasoning and generation model that can process images, text, video and speech input, and produce both text and images. Alongside the model upgrades, AWS also announced a new service called Nova Forge which allows AWS cloud customers to build their own frontier version of AWS Nova models called Novellas for $100,000 a year , according to CNBC reporting.

People feared that ads had arrived, even for paid customers. OpenAI, however, clarified that the app suggestion was not an advertisement, but instead a poor attempt to integrate an app discovery feature within conversations. In a post on X , which has since been viewed nearly 462,000 times, AI startup Hyperbolic’s co-founder, Yuchen Jin, shared a screenshot where ChatGPT seemingly suggested connecting the Peloton app in an unrelated conversation. Worse still, Jin noted he was a paid subscriber to ChatGPT’s $200 per month Pro Plan. At that price point, ads would not be expected. The post, which was reshared and saved hundreds of times across X, received quite a bit of attention, as it seemed to indicate OpenAI was testing the insertion of ads into its paid product. Users complained that paying customers, especially, shouldn’t have to see app suggestions like this. One person also pointed out that they couldn’t get ChatGPT to stop recommending Spotify to them, even though they were an Apple Music subscriber. Hey, Kol.

If Discord becomes a public company, it will face financial scrutiny, so these additions also present a new monetization opportunity for both Discord and game developers. By enabling developers to sell digital goods directly on Discord, the platform helps them reach a wider audience beyond their own communities, potentially boosting revenue. The initial rollout of these features is in partnership with the popular video game Marvel Rivals, which now has a dedicated store page within the game’s official Discord server. Marvel Rivals is a smart choice for this launch, as it garnered 10 million players within 72 hours of its release last year, generated over $100 million in its first month, and has built a community of more than 4 million members on Discord. Players can now browse and purchase in-game items directly from the Marvel Rivals server, which includes items such as bundles, costumes, emotes, and emojis. Additionally, users can create wishlists that friends can view and purchase as gifts. With the holiday season approaching, this feature is particularly timely, as it simplifies gift-giving for those looking to buy for gamer friends or family members. Plus, the ability to gift in-game items through DMs allows users to send gifts to friends even if they don’t play Marvel Rivals themselves.

We asked Taylor if the company had received any communication from the hackers, such as a demand for money, along with other specific questions about the breach, including whether Mixpanel employee accounts were protected with multi-factor authentication . One of its affected customers is OpenAI, which published its own blog post two days later, confirming what Mixpanel had failed to explicitly say in its own post, that customer data had been taken from Mixpanel’s systems. OpenAI said it was affected by the breach because it relied on software provided by Mixpanel to help understand how OpenAI users interact with certain parts of its website, such as its developer documentation . OpenAI users affected by the Mixpanel breach are likely to be developers whose own apps or websites rely on OpenAI’s products to work. OpenAI said its stolen data included the user’s provided name, email addresses, their approximate location (such as city and state) based on their IP address, and some identifiable device data, such as the operating system and browser version.

The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart. Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company. Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99. Orders below $15 will include a small-basket fee of $1.99. Customers in Seattle and Philadelphia can now check the Amazon app and homepage and look for the “30-Minute Delivery” option in the navigation bar to see if it’s available in their area. After placing an order, customers can track their deliveries and tip drivers through the app. “Amazon is utilizing specialized smaller facilities designed for efficient order fulfillment, strategically placed close to where Seattle- and Philadelphia-area customers live and work,” Amazon explained in a blog post . “This approach prioritizes the safety of employees picking and packing orders, reduces the distance delivery partners need to travel, and enables faster delivery times.” The move follows Amazon’s launch of a 15-minute delivery service in the United Arab Emirates in October. The company said at the time that some customers received their orders in as little as six minutes. The launch of the new service marks Amazon’s latest effort to enter the fast delivery market in the United States. In 2014, the e-commerce giant introduced a “Prime Now” service that offered one-hour deliveries, but the company discontinued it in 2021.

Simular is an interesting agentic startup because unlike others, it isn’t trying to control the browser but the PC itself. (Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.) “We can literally move the mouse on the screen and do the click. So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. On Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program Microsoft announced in mid November. (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. Another reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time. Agentic tasks can require completing thousands to millions of discrete steps. Not only can a hallucination at any single step invalidate all of the agent’s work, but hallucinations become statistically ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/02/simular-releases-mac-os-ai-agent-raises-21-5m-from-felicis-with-windows-coming-soon/", "timestamp": 1764727684.6578052}

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies . Simply put, the Sarmat is a doomsday weapon designed for use in an all-out nuclear war between Russia and the United States.

It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug. The five-and-a-half-hour livestream, which has been viewed more than 1.1 million times, also featured Johnson’s 20-year-old son Talmage, whose blood he has injected in his efforts to stay young, journalist Ashlee Vance, a DJ set from Grimes, and Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff. YouTuber MrBeast, while pictured on a cartoonish poster advertising the event, did not show up, which most extremely high people would probably count as a blessing.

Not only would the streamer be adding Mad Men —a show that HBO execs infamously passed on back when Matthew Weiner was a writer on The Sopranos —but it would be presenting the period drama’s episodes in a new 4K remastering. This would, according to the press release , give “audiences and longtime Mad Men fans the opportunity to enjoy the series’ authentically crafted elements with crisp detail and enhanced visual clarity.” As it turned out, there was perhaps too much clarity. Not long after the series went live on HBO Max, a screencap began floating around social media from a scene in the Season One episode “Red in the Face,” where Roger Sterling is vomiting in front of a group of horrified Sterling Cooper clients. When it aired—and in the version still available on AMC+—seven men are onscreen, all of them wearing period-appropriate suits and ties. The HBO Max version, on the other hand, features two men who appear very out of place in 1960: crew members lurking in the background, feeding a hose to create the illusion that actor John Slattery is puking: As of this morning, some episodes were also mislabeled, so you had to click on the episode labeled “Babylon” to see Roger’s stomach-churning display. It’s the kind of moment for which Mad Men ’s own “Not great, Bob!” meme was invented. This is, unfortunately, not the first time this has happened when a classic series has changed platforms and/or formats. Most shows that originated in the 20th century were filmed in standard definition, in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio.

The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to autom", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/", "timestamp": 1764727686.4187613}

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says. One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit , which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform’s rules.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data. The stakes are high for AWS to get this right. While Amazon’s cloud unit dominated the smartphone era, smaller rivals like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have grown at higher rates since the arrival of ChatGPT.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Melinda French Gates, welcome to The Big Interview . Thank you so much for being here. MELINDA FRENCH GATES: Thanks for having me, Katie. So we always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. It's a warmup. Get your brain working, get your muscles working. Are you ready? I am ready.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine , Gavin Kliger , Marko Elez , Akash Bobba , and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment. The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers , consolidating data across agencies , and importing private sector practices —remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles. “That’s absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-doge-doing-now/", "timestamp": 1764727686.9682693}

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change. Update: The $500 discount has sold out, however, you can still buy the Core Ultra 7 model for $650.

These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies. We haven't tested any of the below items—I might for my Gifts for Plant Lovers guide—but here are some other sales on interesting Vego items that might be worth checking out: • Raised Garden Bed Kit for $153 ($27 off) : OK, I might actually buy this myself.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers.

It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now.

Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room. Sony Amazon B&H An upgraded pick for the discerning ear, the Sony Bravia Theater System 6 is marked down by 25% on Amazon for Cyber Monday . This 5.1 surround system is helmed by an impressive soundbar in a surprisingly compact package, assisted by a chunky subwoofer and two surround speakers.

For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR.

Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth.

Norway, however, is bucking the trend—thanks to a tax incentive system that will soon be rolled back.", "content": "The slump does not stop. Tesla sales in Europe slumped again in November 2025, confirming a negative trend that has been going on for more than a year. Data reported by Reuters shows monthly registrations of Tesla automobiles—an accurate way of measuring sales—halved compared to the same month in 2024 in the continent's main markets: down 58 percent in France, minus 59 percent in Sweden, and  down 49 percent in Denmark. In Germany, where the Elon Musk -controlled automaker has its only European plant, on the outskirts of Berlin, recorded just 750 vehicles sold in October, less than half the number sold a year earlier. The big exception to this downward trend is in Norway, where registrations of Tesla cars nearly tripled, to 6,215 units. The numbers for the first 10 months of 2025 expose a structural crisis. Tesla lost about 30 percent of European sales compared to the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association , the body that groups the industry's manufacturers on the Continent.

Volkswagen took the lead among electric vehicle manufacturers by selling 133,465 units in the first six months of the year versus Tesla's 108,878, and Chinese manufacturer BYD sold more than twice as many cars as its US rival in October. The reasons for the decline are many. Musk's political stances have alienated a significant portion of his European customer base, particularly in Germany where the entrepreneur has publicly supported Alternative für Deutschland, Germany's far-right party known as AfD.

Another method is by using an alternate email account (perhaps your spouse's or roommate's?) and alternate payment information as a new customer. If you do use a burner email (you did not hear this from me), check in on your favorite app's terms of service to make sure you're not in violation by re-enrolling with different emails.

The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media , a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here . The findings bring up questions about who exactly has access to footage collected by Flock surveillance cameras and where people reviewing the footage may be based. Flock has become a pervasive technology in the US, with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use every day to investigate things like carjackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock’s business—creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors US residents’ movements—means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs. Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by.

Cyber Monday iPad deals abound, but no, you don't really need to buy that discounted iPad Pro that still costs nearly $1,000.

Apple Amazon Amazon Walmart Apple The iPad A16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) arrived early this year and is the only device in Apple's lineup that doesn't support Apple Intelligence. Maybe that's a good thing, considering that many of those artificial intelligence features aren't very useful right now. However, early rumors suggest that Apple is readying a 12th-gen iPad in the first few months of 2026, and expect to see Apple Intelligence support. It's otherwise expected to be a processor bump, so don't expect much else. If you just want a simple, big-screen tablet to catch up on shows, do some work, and even play games, the iPad A16 fits the bill. It's powerful enough for most apps and games, and the 11-inch screen size is not too big and not too small. This iPad recently got a whole lot more versatile with the iPadOS 26 update , which adds windowing features, turning the iPad experience into a Mac. You can resize windows, flick them to the sides for split-screen, and iPadOS 26.1 brings back Slide Over, so you still have some options on how you want to multitask. Connect it with a Bluetooth keyboard , and you can easily spend hours on this slate typing up emails or doing some other kind of light work.

You get all the accoutrements you'd want in a phone, from wireless charging and a reliable dual-camera system to solid day-long battery life and excellent performance for the money.

CurrentBody CurrentBody While we haven’t tested the Green Tea Serum or Hydrogel Face Mask (both included in this bundle), this offer is too good to pass up. The standout here is the LED Series 2, which alone retails for $470 (and is not on sale), making this deal $48 less than the mask alone. In other words, it’s a steal even if you don’t plan to use the accompanying products. The LED Series 2 is the best red light therapy mask on the market. Crafted from medical-grade silicone, it hugs your face with 236 bulbs, ensuring direct contact. It delivers three wavelengths—red (633 nanometers), near-infrared (830 nanometers), and deep near-infrared (1072 nanometers)—to target skin rejuvenation at multiple depths.

Let's move on.", "content": "My little theory is that the concept of “imprinting” in psychology can just as easily be applied to programming: Much as a baby goose decides that the first moving life-form it encounters is its parent, embryonic programmers form ineradicable attachments to the patterns and quiddities of their first formative language. For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described. My dislike for it was immediate. To arrive at a language late is to see it without the forgiving haze of sentimentality that comes with imprinting—the fond willingness to overlook a flaw as a quirk. What I saw wasn’t a bejeweled tool but a poor little thing that hadn’t quite gotten the news that the world of programming had moved on. Ruby was created in 1995 by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro Matsumoto, affectionately called “Matz.” Aside from creating the only major programming language to have originated outside the West, this Osaka-born practicing Mormon is also known for being exceptionally nice, so much so that the Ruby community adopted the motto MINASWAN, for “Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.” Befitting this, as well as its pretty name, Ruby is easy on the eyes. Its syntax is simple, free of semicolons or brackets. More so even than Python —a language known for its readability—Ruby reads almost like plain English. Programming languages are generally divided into two camps: statically typed a", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/ruby-is-not-a-serious-programming-language/", "timestamp": 1764727693.1588755}

There are countless metrics to factor in, and a nearly unlimited number of mice with unique approaches in defining what's best. Quite honestly, it’s a market rife with opportunities for analysis paralysis to take hold. That’s why I take the time to test countless gaming mice—to tell you what works and what doesn’t. I can’t say precisely which mouse will work for you—that’s dependent not only on technical specs but on your preferences, needs, and hand size—but hopefully I can provide some insights into the top options out there, what's the best for specific types of gamers, and why I’ve picked them.

What Makes a Good Gaming Mouse? Here are a few features that really separate a gaming mouse from a regular came-with-my-PC kind of mouse: Extra-sensitive optical sensors: Gaming mice should have more sensitive optical sensors that can detect smaller movements more quickly than a standard mouse. More buttons: At a minimum, a good gaming mouse should have a clickable scroll wheel, a button for adjusting sensitivity, and two buttons where your thumb rests. Those extra thumb buttons can be lifesavers in competitive games. Better buttons: They should also have higher-quality buttons, and more of them, than a standard office mouse. The left and right buttons should have individual switches inside, tensioned to register rapid clicks and reinforced to withstand more frequent clicks than a normal mouse. Top-of-the-line gaming mice often feature proprietary mechanical switches inside that give them a more tactile feel when you click.

The Tennessee 7th Congressional District results will be declared shortly as polling has already closed. The Tennessee 7th Congressional District result is underway as the special election became unexpectedly competitive when Democrats threw a strong challenge to the Republican stronghold. Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate, faced a massive competition from his Democrat opponent Aftyn Behn, in the election that is being viewed across the country as an early indicator of voter sentiment as the US approaches the 2026 midterm polls. Early indicators cited by The New York Times show Democrat candidate Aftyn Behn leading the table with 52.5% votes as thousands of voters went out to cast the ballot in an election that many view could flip the deep red state in favour of the Democrats. Polls closed in the evening for the special election, which took place after Republican Rep. Mark Green resigned this summer, and the Tennessee election results today are expected to be declared soon. The Tennessee 7th Congressional District election saw a surprise surge of spending in recent weeks, flooding the airwaves and filling residents' mailboxes with campaign flyers. Republican candidate Matt Van Epps was backed by a funding of $1 million from MAGA Inc. in its first spending in a campaign since last year's presidential race. The Trump-supporting super PAC's willingness to spend that money is the reflection of this contest's outsize importance. The special election in Tennessee 7th District saw House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP chair Joe Gruters rally supporters on Monday. Even President Donald Trump addressed the crowd by phone and held a tele-rally for Van Epps later, highlighting the importance of the election in Tennessee — a key stronghokd for the Republicans.

Is India affected?", "summary": "The US has paused immigration applications from 19 travel-ban nations, freezing green card and citizenship processing. Is India impacted, and what happens next?", "content": "The Donald Trump administration has imposed an immediate pause on all immigration applications filed by nationals of 19 countries previously placed under a US travel ban, triggering widespread cancellations of green card interviews and naturalisation ceremonies. The move, confirmed by senior officials and reported by The New York Times on Tuesday, marks one of the broadest immigration slowdowns in recent years and deepens the administration’s post-attack security crackdown. The suspension comes days after two National Guard members were shot near the White House in Washington, an incident authorities have linked to Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan man who obtained asylum in April. In response, the administration announced sweeping new vetting measures and signalled that further restrictions could follow. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) spokesperson Matthew Tragesser defended the decision. “The Trump administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” NYT quoted Tragesser. “We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake.” The pause applies only to people from the 19 nations previously included in the June travel ban, which reportedly covers Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Haiti, Somalia, Venezuela and several other low-income or conflict-affected countries. India is not on the travel-ban list and is therefore not impacted by this application pause.

Polling ends at 7 pm CT (8:00 pm ET) on 2 December (local time). Gates of all polling centres will be closing by 7 pm. However, those who have reached the queue on or before 7 pm will be permitted to cast their votes. There are around 466,000 registered voters who will be casting their votes in the election. Some of the major cities that fall under the 7th Congressional district are Clarksville, Franklin and some ares of Nashville. The nominee for the Republican Party is Matt Vap Eps, who hopes to capitalise on the voter base of Mark Green. On the other hand, competing from the Democratic Party is Aftyn Behn. Voters can locate their polling stations from a website called GoVoteTN . Once you enter your address on this website, it will show you the nearest polling station. Mail-in ballots are accepted in Tennessee, but they have to sent in by election day, i.e., Tuesday. If they do not reach the election offices by end of polling on Tuesday, these votes would not be considered eligible. Although the seat was vacated by a Republican, experts are predicting a tight race this time around. Emerson College conducted a poll to check which candidate is the most favoured, and Republican Matt Vap Epps edged out his opponent by 2 percentage points. The poll also found that 5 per cent of voters are undecided, and their votes could swing the election in favour of either candidate. If the Republican Party loses, it will be an embarrassment for them since Tennessee is traditionally a red state.

The board of India's stock market regulator will take up the most sweeping revision of regulations in decades spanning mutual funds, stock brokers and its own officials later this month, two people aware of the meeting's agenda said. The board will discuss bringing in new rules, updating outdated rules, and removing overlapping ones. In October, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) proposed to cap brokerage and transaction costs that mutual funds charge beyond annual fees collected under their total expense ratio (TER). Sebi also proposed to scrap the additional five basis points charged over the exit load and a more comprehensive disclosure of the TER, which is used to cover management and operating costs. “Mutual fund regulations and stock broker norms will definitely be part of the Sebi agenda,\" one of the two people cited above said on the condition of anonymity. The regulator's board will meet on 17 December. A Sebi spokesperson did not respond to Mint's queries. The proposed overhaul of mutual fund regulations aims to improve transparency in costs and charges levied by mutual funds; however, the regulator's October suggestions drew criticism from asset management companies (AMC), who claim lower brokerage will squeeze income, affect research work, and lead to loss of block deals from brokers. Meanwhile, mutual fund distributors worry that AMCs will pass on some of the pain, shrinking their own income. \"If the recommendations on brokerage costs are accepted as it is, then it would have an impact on AMCs. But we are expecting Sebi to come mid-way,\" an AMC official said on the condition of anonymity.

Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District — a long-standing Republican stronghold — faces an unexpectedly competitive special election tonight, in a race viewed nationally as an early indicator of voter sentiment heading into the 2026 midterms. Although Republican nominee Matt Van Epps remains the evidently favourite, Democratic challenger Aftyn Behn has benefited from a year-long pattern of Democratic overperformance in special elections, raising the prospect of a significantly tighter contest than Republicans are accustomed to. The political backdrop has grown increasingly unfavourable for US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party this autumn. A declining presidential approval rating, widening Democratic leads in national generic ballot polls, and sweeping gubernatorial losses in Virginia and New Jersey have heightened GOP anxieties. Tonight’s contest adds to that pressure. The 7th District — spanning parts of Nashville, the entirety of Clarksville, and stretches of exurban and rural Middle Tennessee — has voted reliably Republican for years. Trump won it by 22 points in 2024 and 15 points in 2020. However, Democrats have been outperforming expectations in every special House election of 2025. In the four previous contests, they improved their margins by 16 to 22 percentage points compared with the 2024 US presidential results.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told Russian media that after a nearly five-hour meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Moscow and Washington were “neither further nor closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine. There is a lot of work to be done.” Yuri Ushakov added that while the meeting was “extremely useful, constructive , and informed”, no agreement had been reached on fundamental questions. “Some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the wording we’ve been offered isn’t acceptable, so the work will continue.” He said the Russian side had received four new documents from the US, in addition to the original peace plan, but that major divergences remained. “We did not discuss … specific American proposals, but discussed the essence of what is embedded in these American documents. We could agree with some things … and the president also did not hide our critical and even negative attitude towards a number of proposals.” Putin’s warning that Russia is prepared for confrontation with Europe overshadowed the diplomatic push. “If Europe — all of a sudden — wants to start a war and if it does start a war, then, very rapidly, there might be a situation where we have no one to negotiate with,” a Kremlin aide quoted him as saying.

Residents are balking as private power company officials overseeing the generation, transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico insist that additional funding is needed to modernize a crumbling grid that Hurricane Maria razed in 2017.

Trump’s extraordinary move undermines decades of U.S. efforts to combat transnational drug networks, potentially damages Washington’s credibility in Latin America, and signals to corrupt actors that political connections can outweigh criminal accountability. Trump signed the pardon for Hernandez on Monday night, a White House official said. The Federal Bureau of Prisons released him from prison in Hazelton, West Virginia, on Monday. While some conservatives in the U.S., including Trump ally Roger Stone, had pushed for Hernandez's release, it was not clear what, or who, prompted Trump to issue the surprise pardon. The U.S. president has cited the dangers of illicit drug flows from Latin America as justification for a series of deadly U.S. attacks on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, and a military buildup near Venezuela. Democrats and legal scholars have criticized the attacks and questioned their legal justification, noting that they have killed at least 80 people. During the Biden administration, the U.S. Justice Department asserted that Hernandez, who was president from 2014 to 2022, had abused his power by accepting millions of dollars in bribes from traffickers to protect their U.S.-bound cocaine shipments and to fuel his rise in Honduran politics. A Manhattan jury found Hernandez guilty in March 2024.

Thus far, 83 people have been killed in 22 strikes on alleged drug boats, which Washington has labelled as a campaign to prevent the illegal flow of drugs into the US. Trump's assurance on Tuesday that military action on land would start soon echoes his words from Thursday, when told service members during a Thanksgiving call that strikes on Venezuelan territory would begin \"very soon\". The US President's comment on Tuesday on launching military operations in Venezuela take on further importance, given his recent order declaring the South American country's airspace as “closed\". The US President's comment also comes at a time when Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing intense scrutiny for allegedly ordering a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat that left 11 dead.

The Trump administration has been weighing options to combat what it has portrayed as Maduro's role in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans. The socialist Venezuelan president has denied having any links to the illegal drug trade. Asked during a news conference about Trump's threats to remove Maduro by force, Leo said: \"It is better to search for ways of dialogue, or perhaps pressure, including economic pressure\". The pope, speaking as he flew home from a visit to Turkey and Lebanon, his first overseas trip, added that Washington should search for other ways to achieve change \"if that is what they want to do in the United States\". Reuters reported last month that options under U.S. consideration include an attempt to overthrow the Venezuelan leader, and that the U.S. military is poised for a new phase of operations after a massive military buildup in the Caribbean and nearly three months of strikes on suspected drug trafficking boats off Venezuela's coast. Leo, answering a journalist's question, also said the signals coming from the Trump administration about its policy toward Venezuela were unclear. \"On one hand, it seems there was a call between the two presidents,\" said the pope, referring to a phone call that Trump had with Maduro last month. \"On the other hand, there is the danger, there is the possibility there will be some activity, some (military) operation.\" \"The voices that come from the United States, they change with a certain frequency,\" added Leo.

The development comes days after US President Donald Trump , in his address to the nation following the attack, labelled the shooting a \"terrorist attack\", before announcing that all immigration requests pertaining to Afghan nationals including visas, green cards, citizenship, and work permits would be suspended immediately. In the aftermath of the attack, the Trump administration also announced \"full scale, rigorous reexamination\" of green card applications and other immigration benefits for people from 19 countries previously designated as “high-risk”, with full restrictions on Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and partial restrictions on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

Temperatures in New York hovered around 40F (4C) by midday, with more than a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) of rain expected in the coming hours, according to the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, the central Hudson River Valley and a large swath of New England braced for six to 10 inches of snow, with up to a foot possible in some locations. Periods of rain and heavy snow are forecast to strike some major highways across the region, creating trouble for air travelers in larger cities. Heading into Tuesday afternoon in New York, 3,184 flights were delayed around the US, with another 146 canceled, according to FlightAware. Winter weather advisories and storm warnings late Tuesday morning stretched from North Carolina to Maine’s border with New Brunswick, as the system is forecast to barrel north along the coast. A yellow snowfall warning — indicating a moderate impact — has been issued across much of Nova Scotia, as well as southern Ontario, by Environment and Climate Change Canada. “All the big cities are missing it today,” Bob Oravec, a senior branch forecaster at the US Weather Prediction Center, said of the storm’s biggest effects. “It is moving pretty quick. Even though it will snow hard today, it won’t be a storm that lasts forever.” In New York City, the rain is forecast to taper off late Tuesday, and Wednesday will be sunny with a high of 41F (5C) expected before a blast of colder air arrives later in the week. Thursday night’s low is expected to dip to 20F. Boston will likely see snow overnight, turning to slush early Wednesday morning as gusty winds sweep the city.

As the first Cabinet member to speak, Hegseth reaffirmed the Pentagon’s commitment to striking alleged narco-boats. \"As I've said and will say again, we've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean,\" Hegseth said. \"Because they have been poisoning the American people. And Joe Biden tried to approach it with kid gloves.\" The Defense Secretary highlighted the broader goals of the strikes : stopping the flow of drugs and eliminating threats. \"We're stopping the drugs, we're striking the boats, we're defeating narco-terrorists,\" Hegseth added. Hegseth defended the second strike by citing the “fog of war”, emphasizing the uncertainty and confusion inherent in combat operations. Hegseth stated: -He did not see survivors in the water at the time of the second strike. -The vessel was already on fire, which influenced the decision. -He did not remain for the remainder of the mission after the first strike. -The admiral in charge had “complete authority” to order the follow-up strike and, in his view, “made the right call.” The comments come amid scrutiny over Pentagon operations in the Caribbean. A report said a follow-up strike in September that killed survivors of an earlier attack. Hegseth’s remarks signal continued aggressive action against alleged narco-terrorist activities at sea.

India's retail inflation rate, based on the consumer price index, has eased from 10.87% in October 2024 to 0.25% in October 2025. The rate is now below the central bank’s target band of 2-6%. And crude oil prices, which have a trickle effect on overall inflation, have eased in recent months. The price of India’s crude basket so far this fiscal year has averaged a little over $67 a barrel, benign compared with $78.56 of FY25 and $82.58 of FY24. “We are hopeful of a rate cut by the RBI. This is the right time,” said Goenka, vice-chairman of the RPG Group, adding that the price situation was favourable. “Crude oil prices have also been stable. We believe it's a good time for a 25 basis-point-rate cut to further spur economic growth.\" So far this calendar year, the RBI has lowered its repo rate by 100 bps to 5.5%. The policy rate was left unchanged at its last monetary policy review in October. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to announce its next move on 5 December. Asked about the moderation seen in goods and services tax (GST) collections growth in November and also in India's October factory output, Goenka said, despite these signals, the outlook for the December quarter and for FY26 remained optimistic. “We are still optimistic about the rest of the year… We are seeing good demand,” said Goenka, referring to the 7.9% growth seen in household spending in the September quarter. “I think the measures taken by the government have been very strong, both the income tax relief in the Union budget and the recent GST reforms in addition to various other reforms that have happened all through the year,” Goenka said.

The visit marks the latest effort by Trump to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. Trump has previously sought to mediate peace, including a summit with Putin in Alaska in August and meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but so far, no agreement has been reached. A leaked US draft of 28 peace proposals last week raised concerns among Ukrainian and European officials. Critics argued that the proposals largely aligned with Moscow’s key demands, including restrictions on Ukraine’s military and Russia’s control of a fifth of Ukrainian territory. European powers subsequently offered their own counter-proposals. Zelensky emphasized Ukraine’s commitment on social media: “Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security. This is exactly the level of commitment that must be compelled from the Russian side.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed, as per Reuters, that Putin would meet Witkoff and Kushner, but refrained from commenting on Russia’s \"red lines,\" noting that megaphone diplomacy is unhelpful. The envoys were accompanied only by an interpreter. Putin has indicated he is open to discussions but warned that if Ukraine rejects an agreement, Russian forces could advance further. He described the discussions as a preliminary review of proposals rather than a formal agreement. According to Reuters, a convoy transporting Witkoff and Kushner arrived in central Moscow from Vnukovo airport.

He said, “We reject the ridiculous statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, which is yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.” Connecting the timeline of events, Jaiswal clarified that India received Pakistan's request through diplomatic channels well in advance and responded within hours. He stated, “The request for overflight clearance for Pakistani aircraft carrying humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka was received by the High Commission of India in Islamabad at around 1300 hrs on December 01, 2025.” Jaiswal emphasised that New Delhi acted with urgency because the situation in Sri Lanka demanded immediate assistance. He said, “Given the urgency of humanitarian assistance, the Government of India processed the request expeditiously the same day and granted the overflight permission as per the itinerary proposed at 1730 hrs on December 01, 2025.” Even as India detailed the prompt approval issued on Monday, Pakistan continued to accuse New Delhi of creating hurdles. The Pakistan Foreign Office claimed on X that \"India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka,\" alleging that an aircraft had been waiting \"for over 60 hours now\" for airspace access.

His comments come as European countries push for conditions that ensure Ukraine’s sovereignty and future security, while Moscow insists on guarantees that align with its strategic interests. The remarks further strain already tense ties between Moscow and European capitals, where leaders worry that any deal tilted toward Russia could encourage future aggression. European leaders have been pressing for a peace deal that preserves Ukraine’s territorial integrity and restricts Russian advances.

Giving Tuesday 2025 is today, 2 December, marking a day for people across the United States and the world to give back to their communities, support local organisations, and help those in need. The Giving Tuesday movement was started in 2012 as a simple idea: a day to encourage people to do good. It has since exploded into a global phenomenon, unleashing the power of radical generosity. The movement has raised billions of dollars for non-profit organisations globally since its inception. In the US alone, participants donated an estimated $3.6 billion in 2024, supporting causes ranging from at-risk youth and the environment to animal shelters and food insecurity. While financial donations are always essential for non-profits to sustain their vital work, there are many meaningful ways to participate in Giving Tuesday that don't involve sending cash. Generosity comes in many forms—of time, skills, goods, and voice. Many organisations, such as women's shelters, community fridges, children's hospitals, and animal shelters, are always accepting tangible, essential items. This can be a great opportunity to declutter before the end of the year and donate gently used clothes, blankets, or books. One of the most valuable gifts you can give is your time and expertise. Look for a social cause or organisation that matters to you and reach out to them directly. Join volunteer programmes at local hospitals, animal shelters, food banks, or community cleanup initiatives. Share Professional Skills (Pro Bono) : Leverage your expertise in fields such as marketing, accounting, programming, law, or healthcare. Offering these services pro bono allows non-profits to receive high-level support without draining their limited budgets.

The products of the brand reportedly come with the care instructions: \"Please give it to your beloved woman, she knows everything.\" The care tag is written in both Chinese and English. However, it doesn't provide any washing instructions. According to multiple reports, the tag comes with two QR codes linking to the social media accounts of the brand. South Morning China Post reported that the incident came to light from a coat made by Jiangsu-based Gu Zhuo Kang Zheng Garment Company. The same company owns brands like Labour Union, as per a report by Lizhi News. Meanwhile, the incident has created a storm on the internet after someone posted the tag online. It has now gone viral. The incident has gained mixed reactions from netizens. One of them was quoted saying by the South Morning China Post: “How come you let your beloved women do the chores for you? This is apparent exploitation. Why not print the complete washing method and add a sentence ‘please finish reading this and learn how to wash clothes for the sake of your beloved person’.” “Which brand is this? Sisters, we should boycott it,” another was quoted. “I do not think there is any problem with the tag. I do not understand how this could cause a confrontation between men and women,” someone else also said. Yet another added, “It is not necessary for girls to be so sensitive.” Meanwhile, the company's spokeswoman, known as Sister Yang, has issued a statement of apology. Yang reportedly stated that they did not intend to discriminate against women. “It is our inappropriate expression, as well as the wrong spelling of some English words, that led to the public’s misunderstanding that we look down on women and we aim to provoke the opposition of the two sexes.

The complex, now nearing completion, was previously referred to as the Executive Enclave under the Central Vista Redevelopment project.

The 'Seva Teerth' will be a workplace designed to reflect the spirit of service and where national priorities take shape, officials said, adding that India's public institutions were undergoing a quiet but profound shift, PTI reported. The idea of governance is moving from 'satta' (power) to 'seva' (service) and from authority to responsibility, they said, adding that the change was not just administrative, but cultural and moral. Raj Bhawans, the residences of governors of states, too, are being renamed as 'Lok Bhawans'. Officials said under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the spaces of governance have been reshaped to reflect 'kartavya' (duty) and transparency, PTI reported.  “Every name, every building and every symbol now points to a simple idea. Government exists to serve,” they said. Recently, the government renamed Rajpath, the tree-lined avenue from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, as Kartavya Path. The prime minister's official residence was renamed Lok Kalyan Marg in 2016, a name that conveys welfare, not exclusivity and a reminder of the work that lies ahead for every elected government. The Central Secretariat is named Kartavya Bhavan, a vast administrative hub built around the idea that public service is a commitment. “These changes mark a deeper ideological transition.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable.
