With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations, offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54% drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30% decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction. Germany has crossed 4 lakh international students in the 2024/25 winter semester, supported by dual-citizenship reforms.

We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

IIE, a not-for-profit headquartered in New York, Monday released a fall 2025 snapshot survey on international student enrolment at 825 higher education institutions in the US. Around 57 per cent of these institutions reported a decrease in new international student enrolments for the 2025-26 academic year, while 14 per cent reported stable numbers, and 29 per cent indicated an increase.

In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763633752.1731455}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763633766.6900413}

The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date. Immigration officials note that not all visa holders are expected to apply immediately for the additional five hours, as some may wait until their next visa renewal or may be nearing the end of their studies. The government has also extended in-study work rights to all tertiary students participating in approved exchange or Study Abroad programmes, including one-semester courses — a change designed to make New Zealand’s universities and colleges more appealing to international learners.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends. For those few who are genuinely interested in Chemistry as a career option and want to build, innovate, and explore, the decision between BTech in Chemical Engineering or BTech in Chemical Science and Technology becomes one of the most defining choices.

Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa.

A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive. UPSC reports from 2010 to 2021 show consistently low participation of women and transgender individuals in the Civil Services Examination, with 2021 being the most recent data available. According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam. On the other hand, in the same year, 19 transgender candidates applied to sit for the UPSC exam, but just four appeared, and none made it to the final list. While the above represents just one exam cycle, a more comprehensive view emerges when we analyse UPSC CSE annual report data across 2010-2021. The data indicate a consistent upward trajectory in the proportion of women appearing for the UPSC Civil Services Examination. However, despite this progress, the overall trajectory has remained below the 40 per cent mark, underscoring the persistent gender gap in participation. This rise, especially pronounced in the latter half of the decade, reflects a growing interest among women in civil services.

Each winner will receive Rs 31.5 lakh to further develop their innovations. WaterSense, developed by Polish PhD candidate Filip Budny from the Warsaw University of Technology, won in the Sustainability category. The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible. James Dyson, founder of Dyson, said, “The James Dyson Award supports young inventors who think differently and tackle real-world problems head-on. Filip and Alessandra exemplify that spirit, offering practical and ingenious solutions to health and environmental challenges.” This year’s competition — the 20th edition of the global student design award — received over 2,100 entries from 28 countries and regions.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Nearly half of them believe their roles AI can make a switch in their jobs within the next three to five years. According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations. Among those worried that artificial intelligence could replace their roles, at least 40% are actively considering an exit.

The memo comes after Monarch Tractor was already cutting some positions over the last few weeks at its California corporate facilities and remote teams in India and Singapore, according to multiple former employees who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity. Monarch Tractor was founded in 2018 by a team that included a former top executive at Tesla’s first gigafactory and Carlo Mondavi, a scion of the famous winemaking family. The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms. While Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company announced a restructuring in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech. At least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, according to a lawsuit first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.) Monarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, earlier this year . “The new busines", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/monarch-tractor-preps-for-layoffs-and-warns-employees-it-may-shut-down/", "timestamp": 1763633925.4272716}

And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to. Nvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations. The revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive. Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs. “This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said. Blackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company.

An “infamous mystery hacker” known as the Puppet Master is wreaking havoc on the internet, breaking into the so-called cyber-brains of several humans as well as “every terminal on the network.” As it turns out, the Puppet Master is a creation of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In other words, the Puppet Master is what we would call today a government-backed hacker, or advanced persistent threat ( APT ). In this case, however, the “phantom” hacker goes rogue and is wanted for “stock manipulation, spying, political engineering, terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.” That is the basic premise of the Japanese anime cult classic “ Ghost in the Shell ,” which marked its 30th anniversary this week since its debut, and was based on the chapters titled “Bye Bye Clay” and “Ghost Coast” from the first volume of the eponymous manga, released in May 1989. To say that the story of the Puppet Master was ahead of its time may be an understatement. The World Wide Web, essentially what flourished from the internet as we know it today, was invented in 1989, the same year that the first volume of “Ghost in the Shell’s” manga — including the story of the Puppet Master — hit newsstands in Japan. (The World Wide Web publicly launched in 1991.) In the manga, when the Puppet Master gets caught, an official from Public Security Section 6, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explains that they had been after the hacker “for a long time,” and they “profiled his behavioral tendencies and code/tech patterns.” “As a result, we were finally able to create a special anti-puppeteer attack barrier,” the official says in the manga. At the risk of extrapolating too much from a couple of sentences, the reality is that what the official is describing is basically what cybersecurity companies, such as antivirus firms, do everyday to stop malware. Not only do they create so-called signatures based on the malware’s code, but also based on its behavior and prope", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/how-the-classic-anime-ghost-in-the-shell-predicted-the-future-of-cybersecurity-30-years-ago/", "timestamp": 1763633926.3134036}

Sardain claims that Cavela solves this problem through its AI agents, software tools that perform tasks autonomously and, in this case, act as a personal procurement team. These agents can find potential suppliers in over 40 countries and negotiate product specifications and pricing. On Wednesday, Cavela announced that it raised $6.6 million in seed funding co-led by XYZ Venture Capital and Susa Ventures, with participation from Crossover Capital. Finding suppliers and negotiating pricing with them is an inherently arcane, time-consuming process, and, according to Sardain, it was impossible to automate without generative AI. “Making products involves a lot of text data, image data, diagrams, sketches, photos. This is the kind of data that didn’t play nice with technology up until AI,” Sardain said. The latest LLM and image models allow brands to upload their complete product information, including specifications, blueprints, and all other details about the item they want produced, directly into Cavela’s AI agent. Based on those particulars, the agent identifies dozens of potential manufacturers and then instantly contacts those factories via WhatsApp, email, or text to understand production capacity and lead times and to collect pricing quotes. Sardain claims the entire process is seamless, sparing brands from sending hundreds of messages back and forth. “They log in a couple of days later, and there are quotes in their i", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/cavela-lands-6-6m-to-help-brands-beat-pre-tariff-manufacturing-costs/", "timestamp": 1763633926.8388698}

Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new. “Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same. “Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said. Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.” Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox. “So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox.

To further that effort, the company recently raised $298 million in a Series B round led by Redpoint Ventures at a valuation of $2.5 billion. The funding round also saw participation from a16z; Aglaé Ventures; Alumni Ventures; NBA athletes Allen Crabbe, Blake Griffin, and Taylor Griffin; Battery Ventures; Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’ investment firm, NFDG; and Roku founder Anthony Wood. The round brings the company’s total capital raised to $350 million. Alongside the funding, Function unveiled Medical Intelligence Lab, an effort to build a “medical intelligence” generative AI model that can be used to provide personalized health insights based on users’ data, content, and research. The company said the model is trained by doctors. For its customers, the company is offering an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on their health data and can tap their previous lab results, doctor’s notes, and scans to provide tailored guidance. “It is not good enough to be in a world where AI exists and not be applying it to your health,” Jonathan Swerdlin, CEO and co-founder of Function, told TechCrunch. “You should be able to manage your biology. The objective of Function Health is to apply the best available technology to human health.” Swerdlin noted the platform meets HIPAA standards, fully encrypts user data, and never sells personal information. “Your data and your identity are never for sale.

The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix. The company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September.

It previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024 , led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. But Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission. Those types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement.

Across North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less. Data centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, “areas where a lot of data center development is occurring,” Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News. The report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is “contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.” That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap. At the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.) This year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn’t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state’s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can’t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than “peaker” power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up. Still, Texas isn’t entirely in the clear. Most of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That’s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work.

However, Kiki’s model violated local short-term rental laws, leading to its shutdown this past June. The New York Mayor’s Office of Special Enforcement (OSE) announced on Wednesday that Kiki has agreed to pay more than $152,000 to settle charges. Backed by Blackbird, the Airbnb competitor aimed to simplify the subletting process and boldly promised a solution that would let users sublet their spaces for up to six months. The platform used a matching system similar to those of dating apps, connecting listers and renters based on their preferences. However, the startup found itself on the wrong side of NYC’s short-term rental laws. Specifically, Local Law 18, which was enacted in 2022. This legislation imposes strict guidelines on short-term rentals, allowing them only if the host is registered with the OSE as a short-term rental host and meets additional criteria, such as staying in the same unit as the guests. When the law was first introduced, many Airbnb hosts found the regulations too difficult to manage, leading to a dramatic 85% drop in short-term rentals, according to Inside Airbnb, an organization that monitors the platform’s data. Additionally, under the law, booking services must use OSE’s verification system to confirm that hosts are either registered or exempt. Unverified transactions face a penalty of $1,500 or three times the revenue earned, whichever is lower. According to the OSE, Kiki failed to submit quarterly reports of short-term rental transactions for eligible listings and didn’t verify nearly 400 short-term rental transactions. “This settlement sends a clear message: If you are a company that facilitates short-term rentals, ignoring city laws will be an expensive proposition,” Christian Klossner, executive director of the OSE, said in a statement. “Kiki", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/subletting-startup-kiki-paid-over-152k-to-settle-charges-after-violating-nyc-short-term-rental-laws/", "timestamp": 1763633928.6544552}

The moderation changes are rolling out with the latest version of the Bluesky app (v. 1.110), which also includes a dark-mode app icon and a redesigned feature for controlling who can reply to your post. The company says the moderation updates are a result of Bluesky’s rapid growth and the need for “clear standards and expectations for how people treat each other” on the platform. “On Bluesky, people are meeting and falling in love, being discovered as artists, and having debates on niche topics in cozy corners.

Consumers have become accustomed to these kinds of text-based AI summaries, since they likely see them when their phone summarizes texts, or when they see a (perhaps unwanted) AI summary at the top of their Google results. But these video summaries veer into newer territory, which may appear more obtrusive in the viewing experience than text summaries — or, maybe they’ll be embraced by people who don’t remember what happened on “Bosch.” Prime Video’s competitors are also exploring how they can integrate generative AI into their products. YouTube TV, for example, uses a “Key Plays” feature to help viewers catch up on sports games if they start watching while the game is in progress. While it’s a bit imperfect (its algorithm seems to only be able to identify key offensive plays in baseball), the feature helped YouTube TV win its first Technical Emmy Award .

The company will also release tools that show how songs are connected and what inspired them. The second set of tools is showcased in a new, interactive feature called SongDNA, which shows which songs are being sampled in a given track, who has covered the tune, and what other projects the song’s collaborators may have been involved in. TechCrunch reported in October that Spotify was developing the SongDNA feature as a way to help users discover music through a song’s credits, after references to the feature were spotted in the app’s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong. With SongDNA, Spotify users could explore the other projects that the artists, musicians, and others who worked on a track are involved with. Previously, the Song Credits feature had only featured the topline performance, songwriting, and production credits. References to the sampled music, meanwhile, come from the online community-built database WhoSampled, which Spotify has acquired. Notably, the streaming service TIDAL also offers interactive credits that let users explore music through the contributors behind the songs. Spotify has also planned a feature called “About the song,” which will allow listeners to explore swipeable cards in the “Now Playing” view. Those cards will offer details like what inspired the song, the stories behind the music, the cultural impact, and more. These stories are sourced from third-party resources, which will be linked in the cards. This type of background information about music is something Spotify has offered in previous years, when it partnered with lyrics site Genius on a feature that offered details on certain tracks’ backstories . However, that feature was limited to those stories Genius had in its database. The upcoming feature will link out to various places on the web", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/spotifys-new-features-let-listeners-explore-the-people-and-stories-behind-their-favorite-music/", "timestamp": 1763633929.6030316}

In the short term, it's cheaper and easier to just leave those boxes running in a forgotten closet. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.” Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. The study found that the UK (followed closely by the US) faces the biggest relative risk of the group from widespread use of outmoded, ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/cisco-aging-technical-infrastructure/", "timestamp": 1763633930.397301}

Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation. These groups are lobbying instead for a light-touch set of federal laws to guide AI progress. “If the president wants to win the AI race, the American people need to know that AI is safe and trustworthy,\" says Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-prepares-executive-order-challenging-state-ai-laws/", "timestamp": 1763633931.2812998}

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said. The CEO’s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments. But the increase was not enough to fully make up for the recent sell-off. Nvidia has enjoyed three years of booming success since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and caused a massive surge in demand for the company’s GPUs, which are used to train and operate generative AI systems. Nvidia dominates the global market for GPUs, and its latest releases have become highly sought after, with demand far exceeding supply. On Wednesday, Nvidia executives reiterated that it has about $500 billion in unfilled orders. The company has used its newfound wealth to buy back its own shares and invest billions of dollars in AI companies, including top users and customers of its chips such as ChatGPT developer OpenAI, data center operator CoreWeave , and Elon Musk’s xAI , which develops the chatbot Grok.

Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years.

The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice.

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763633932.8286974}

I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again.

You likely don’t need the multi-thousand-hertz refresh rates or the intense level of customization most of these keyboards offer, but it never hurts to have something that can outperform you. Unlike a top-of-the-line sports car, having a keyboard that’s faster than you won’t ever send you careening off the side of the road. It just means you’ll lose the excuse of “Sorry, my keyboard didn’t pick up that keypress” when you peek just a bit too far into a sniper lane and get domed. More than anything else, the main appeal of Hall effect keyboards is just how much they can do, from adjustable actuation points, rapid trigger, accidental keypress protection, and multiple inputs per key. Almost every major keyboard player now sells a Hall effect keyboard, so which model should you buy? I've been testing and deconstructing keyboards for years—mechanical, Hall effect, ergonomic, you name it—these are my favorites.

The Hall effect is a reaction between magnets and electricity. When a magnet moves closer to an electrical current in a conductor, it moves the electrons, and with this, the distance between the magnet and the conductor can be measured and reported back to your computer. The magnet sits in the switch's stem, and the Hall effect sensor is on the printed circuit board of the keyboard. Your computer can interpret this information to register a keypress once the key is at a certain distance.

The conspiracy theories benefited him; they were one of the factors buoying him to office. It’s only been in the last few weeks—spurred by the release of new Epstein documents and the public defection of GOP lawamkers—that the complex web of misinformation has spun out of Trump’s control . It all began with QAnon. It is hard to overstate just how fringe QAnon was when Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene began posting about it in November 2017, when she posted a video praising Q as a “patriot.” The movement was led by “Q,” someone who claimed to be a government insider and who posted what they claimed was top secret intel in posts, known as “drops,” on the anonymous message board 4chan. Q laid out a wild and untrue conspiracy theory that a cabal of Democrat and Hollywood elites were behind a supposed global sex trafficking ring. Already, Jeffrey Epstein was among the key characters in the QAnon universe. Epstein was first mentioned just two weeks after QAnon began in late October 2017 and was referenced dozens of times in the almost 5,000 posts Q wrote over the following three years. Like all good conspiracy theories, this one contained a kernel of truth: The fact that Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution solicitation charges meant QAnon supporters felt emboldened to believe every wild allegation that Q put forward . I became aware of QAnon in early 2018 but didn’t write about it until September of that year . At the time Greene started promoting it, years before she was elected to Congress, the conspiracy was in its infancy with just a handful of dedicated followers. Trump was quickly cast as the hero of this narrative, working against the “deep state” to expose these demons and bring about “the storm,” which would see the cabal unmasked and everyone from Epstein to the Cl", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-donald-trump-lost-control-of-the-epstein-spin-cycle/", "timestamp": 1763633933.3242552}

Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States. Then, the user must enter a FIFA portal, which will indicate the steps to follow in order to proceed with the visa application.

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108. Oddly, photo-based translations work with 113 languages. Lastly, real-time call translation has suppo", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/vasco-translator-q1/", "timestamp": 1763633933.9191153}

In the first nine months of 2025, Porsche's operating profit plummeted by 99 percent compared to the same stint the year before. Yep, 99 percent. Profit has tanked for the auto brand with a track record of making billions. The reasons for Porsche's misfortune are no secret. There's the hugely expensive product strategy shift that saw the dramatic scaling back of EV plans. There was Porsche scrapping projects to build its own EV batteries in-house and instead developing new combustion and hybrid models. Plus, the double hit of US tariffs and a slump in the Chinese market have left the German automaker reeling. However, whether or not the EU decides to rewrite its EV transition timetable , the future for autos, sooner or later, will not be combustion but electric. So this means that European car companies playing the long game must still show their prowess in electrification. Which brings us to today's reveal of the final production Cayenne Electric and Cayenne Turbo Electric. The Cayenne is Porsche's first fully electric SUV. Costing $109,000 for the Cayenne, and $163,000 for the turbo version (£83,200 and £130,900 respectively in the UK), Porsche will be hoping that this, its first ever fully electric SUV, will present better long-term value for money than its formidable Taycan has, which saw unlucky owners lose half the value of the car in its first six months, pushing some into negative equity on the vehicles. This new electric SUV is the most powerful production Porsche of all time, and the specs are fittingly mighty. The Cayenne Turbo shifts from 0 to 62 mph in 2.5 seconds, from 0 to 124 mph in 7.4 seconds, and goes on to a top speed of 162 mph. A new drive system develops up to 850 kW (1,156 PS) and up to 1,500 Nm of torque when the cars' Launch Control is activated.

However, for those coming from previous generation ESWAP pads , it's unlikely to seem quite so revolutionary—in fact, it's essentially the same, bar the addition of Hall effect tech. Out of the box, the X2 H.E. looks suitably impressive, a monolith of black broken up only by the copper tones of the D-pad and triggers, subtly matched by the lettering on the face buttons and dragon \"2\" of the logo. The LED color bar of the H.E.A.R.T. is gone, making this look and feel far more mature, although the mix of matte black for fixed features and glossy removable modules does make for a degree of visual inconsistency. In the hand, it's definitely better suited to those with larger grips, thanks to a chunky overall size of 160 x 120 x 60 mm and the unusual height of the default thumbstick modules.

The 32-year-old Michigan engineer, who did not want to use his real name due to privacy concerns, first watched porn at the impressionable age of 12, but never realized he had a problem until just after his father’s funeral three years ago. “I didn't shed a single tear,” he says. “I didn't know how to react happily or sadly to anything.” That’s when his porn consumption spiraled—combined with stress, anxiety, and depression—and he locked himself in his room “all day.” The only thing that seemed palpable, he recalls, “was that rush of dopamine” delivered by an intense session of hardcore porn viewing. But for Jamie, who is Christian, those fleeting moments of porn-fueled transcendance were followed by far deeper lows, including suicidal ideations. This past March, Jamie says his partner angrily confronted him over his compulsive porn consumption, accusing him of lying and committing adultery. Jamie’s “entire world came down.” He admitted he felt that he was addicted, begged for her forgiveness, temporarily moved back in with his mother, and renounced porn. That’s when he found Relay , an app created by a pair of Mormon college students that claims it can help people “take back control from porn, one day at a time.” Jamie promised his partner he would never watch porn again—and she gave him one chance. The app provides a comprehensive plan to stop watching porn, with videos by therapists, daily journal prompts, live group sharing sessions, and a function to address serious urges. Users even keep track of each other’s porn-free streaks, with a “Live Milestone” ticker.

Bland “ brain rot ” and AI -looking memes are out; Big Chungus is in. As with anything on the internet, the origin of the Great Meme Reset is hard to place.

The post said nothing of a January 1 launch date, or a return to the memes of the last decade, but the idea was planted. Now hundreds of posts are discussing the reboot—and a return to the internet’s “dank” era. Which implies, of course, that memes lack dankness these days. If anything, Gen Z– and Gen Alpha–fueled internet culture has prided itself on somewhat meaningless content like “ 6 7 ” and absurdist, seemingly AI-generated “ Italian brain rots ,” but after nearly a year of memes with little humanity or depth, a backlash has begun. “Because of just how unrecognizable memes have become,” TikTok creator Noah Glenn Carter ( @noahglenncarter ) said in a recent video, “everyone has come to an agreement that on January 1, 2026, we are going to completely reset all memes and go back to the originals.” When I reach Carter via email, the creator seems pretty convinced the reset idea could take off, and he plans to make more videos promoting it. “The memes we have now are called ‘brain rot’ for a reason,” Carter says. “The ones 10+ [years older], most of the time, had a story behind them. Or they at least made sense.

You can create folders within your launch grid. There are a few settings you can tweak, such as whether the launcher should take over the full screen or open in a window. You can also configure the appearance, decide whether the app should open when your Mac does, and set a keyboard shortcut for opening the launcher. Customize the look. As I said, it’s not a perfect replacement, but take some time setting up folders and tweaking the settings and I think you'll find it works well. And you can't complain about the price.

A new investigation reveals the impact of using spying to solve a problem.", "content": "It was in physical education class when Laila Gutierrez swapped out self-harm for a new vice. The freshman from Phoenix had long struggled with depression and would cut her arms to feel something. Anything. The first drag from a friend’s vape several years ago offered the shy teenager a new way to escape. This article was copublished with The 74 , a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here . She quit cutting but got hooked on nicotine. Her sadness got harder to carry after her uncle died, and she felt she couldn’t turn to her grieving parents for comfort. Bumming fruity vapes at school became part of her routine. “I would ask my friends who had them, ‘I’m going through a lot, can I use it?’” Gutierrez, now 18, told The 74. “Or ‘I failed my test and I feel like smoking would be better than cutting my wrists.’” It worked until she got caught. Like students across the country, Gutierrez got dragged into a nicotine-fueled war between vape manufacturers—including a company that leveraged online advertisements on the websites of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to hook kids on e-cigarettes —and educators, who’ve turned to digital surveillance tools and discipline to crack down on the youngest users. Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour. An in-depth investigation by The 74 reveals how nicotine-addicted teens, who often begin vaping under social pressure or, like Gutierrez, to cope with hardship, are routinely kicked out of school instead of receiving meaningful services that could steer them away from tobacco and help them break free of their vape pens. Candid interviews with a dozen high schoolers and recent graduates from across the country reveal how vaping has become ubiquitous in schools. The battery-powered nicotine sticks are more than an addiction: They define students’ social status, friend groups, and coping strategies years before they’re 21 an", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/vaping-surveillance-school-bathrooms/", "timestamp": 1763633935.111476}

The world, and especially Hallmark movies, is full of holiday disaster stories: burnt turkeys, failed desserts, steamed hams . But I'm not bragging when I say that the first Thanksgiving dinner I prepared for my extended family—a little early, this year—was an unmitigated success. My aunt couldn't stop talking about the black pepper in the biscuits and the sage on the carrots. My uncle went in for the turkey and the apple-sausage stuffing. My father didn't speak at all, unless prompted. He just ate and ate. This was a compliment. But of course, I had cheated. I had ordered my Thanksgiving in the mail—one of the new breed of Thanksgiving meal kits. The meal was genuinely home-cooked, of course, prepared mostly from scratch. But the entire seven-platter feast—its ingredients and recipes—had arrived two days before, in a box large enough to house a primal cut of beef. It was Thanksgiving in a box: a $200 “Chef's Table Thanksgiving” meal kit available from sister meal delivery plans Sunbasket and Gobble . The spread from Sunbasket was vast and generous. The table contained a nearly 3-pound roast of turkey, mounds of mashed potato, pebbled cranberry compote, roasted carrots dressed in miso-sage butter, brussels sprouts dappled with pecorino romano and pancetta, an endless platter of fennel-apple-sausage-stuffing, Gruyère black-pepper biscuits caked more than an inch tall, a tureen of deep brown turkey gravy, a ginger apple crisp waiting in the wings.

The screen is slightly lower resolution, and the pass-through isn't quite as sharp, but otherwise the Quest 3S plays the same games and experiences as the more expensive Quest 3 . Both headsets suffer from limited battery life, so don't expect more than a couple of hours of play at a time.

Not only are these an innovative way to get chronic snoozers out of bed, but they can be great for those who are hard of hearing, utilizing different frequencies and pitches as well as movement through vibration. I’m a very heavy sleeper, so I tried one of these nontraditional extreme alarm clocks every day for a full week (at least). I chose the extreme alarms that were the most rated or reviewed online, found most often on online retailers like Amazon and in the app store, and tried to get a versatile range of options that focused on different areas, whether it be sound or activity.

Agent 365 is not a platform for making enterprise AI tools; it’s a way to manage them, as if they were human employees . Companies using generative AI agents in their digital workplace can use Agent 365 to organize their growing sprawl of bots, keep tabs on how they’re performing, and tweak their settings. The tool is rolling out today in Microsoft’s early access program. Essentially, Microsoft created a trackable workspace for agents . “Tools that you use to manage people, devices, and applications today, you'd want to extend them to run agents as well in the future,” says Charles Lamanna, a president of business and industry for Microsoft’s Copilot , its AI chatbot. Lamanna envisions a future where companies have many more agents performing labor than humans. For example, if a company has 100,000 employees, he sees them as using “half a million to a million agents,” ranging in tasks from simple email organization to running the “whole procurement process” for a business. He claims Microsoft internally uses millions of agents. This army of bots, with permission to take actions inside a company’s software and automate aspects of an employee’s workflow, could quickly grow unwieldy to track. A lack of clear oversight could also open businesses up to security breaches . Agent 365 is a way to manage all your bots, whether those agents were built with Microsoft’s tools or through a third-party platform. Agent 365’s core feature is a registry of an organization’s active agents all in one place, featuring specific identification numbers for each and details about how they are being used by employees. It’s also where you can change the settings for agents and what aspects of a business’s software each one has permission to access.

As talk of an AI bubble grows, the company is keen to stress that its latest release is more than just a clever model and chatbot—it’s a way of improving Google’s existing products, including its lucrative search business, starting today. “We are the engine room of Google, and we're plugging in AI everywhere now,” Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind, an AI-focused subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told WIRED in an interview ahead of the announcement. Hassabis admits that the AI market appears inflated, with a number of unproven startups receiving multibillion-dollar valuations. Google and other AI firms are also investing billions in building out new data centers to train and run AI models, sparking fears of a potential crash. But even if the AI bubble bursts, Hassabis thinks Google is insulated. The company is already using AI to enhance products like Google Maps, Gmail, and Search. “In the downside scenario, we will lean more on that,” Hassabis says. “In the upside scenario, I think we've got the broadest portfolio and the most pioneering research.” Google is also using AI to build popular new tools like NotebookLM , which can auto-generate podcasts from written materials, and AI Studio which can prototype applications with AI.

Whether you're scouting terrain, watching birds in your backyard, stargazing, or getting season tickets at Fenway, binoculars bring the world closer.

Binoculars are usually listed with two number specifications; for example, our top pick, the Nikon Monarch M5 are 8x42 binoculars. Here's what that means: The number 8 refers to the magnification power . Objects seen through these binoculars will be eight times bigger than when you look with your naked eye. Newcomers should stick with 6X or 8X. They have enough power that you'll see things clearly, but they don't magnify so much that you'll struggle to find what you want to see or have trouble following fast-moving objects (though all binoculars take some practice). The 42 refers to the size of the front lens in millimeters . The larger the front lens (also called the objective lens), the more light reaches your eye. That means the image will be bigger, brighter, and clearer. A pair of 8x42 binoculars should be significantly brighter and offer a better viewing experience than a pair of 8x32 binoculars, even though both provide the same magnification. But the larger you get, the more glass they will use—so they'll weigh more. The weight difference between an 8x32 pair and a 10x42 pair is significant if you're wearing them all day.

I'd get done with a hard day of being an 8-year-old and come home to crack open a cardboard door to eat some powdery chocolate the way a sitcom dad makes a beeline for his post-work or lawn-mower beer.

Advent calendars are cooler now than they ever were when I was a kid, and the contents aren't limited to novelty Santa-shaped chocolates anymore. I painstakingly tore into several cardboard doors to get to the bottom of the best Advent calendars. My favorites are below. Even if you start cracking into your calendar after December 1, don’t worry; a lot of Advent calendars are just 12 days. Plus, who needs rules? Just double up on treats if you start late!

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate. We also raise our EBITDA margin by 150-10bps on the margin beat.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers.

That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

This summons comes after disclosures made by Mohammed Salim Sohail Shaikh, also known as Lavish, a drug supplier who was recently deported from Dubai. Lavish is linked to the massive mephedrone seizure in Sangli in March 2024, which involved a total value of ₹ 252 crore. Mohammed Salim Sohail Shaikh, also known as Lavish, is a prime suspect in the ₹ 252-crore mephedrone (MD) drug trafficking case uncovered by Mumbai Police's Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC) in March 2024. Originally from Dongri in south Mumbai, Sheikh had been living in Dubai for the past three years.  According to an Indian Express report, Lavish is said to have been a close associate of drug lord Salim Dola, overseeing the production of mephedrone in at least seven states across India. Dola was the primary suspect associated with the Dawood Ibrahim gang that operated the drug network. Together with the recently deported accused, Dola allegedly controlled the entire operation from Dubai, aided by his son, Taher; his nephew, Mustafa Kubbawala; his close aide, Salim Shaikh, also known as Lavish; and several others who remain at large, some of whom are still believed to be in the UAE.  He recruited people for the syndicate to distribute and deliver mephedrone, a potent synthetic stimulant, throughout the country, an official said, as reported by Deccan Chronicle. Earlier this year, the police successfully facilitated the deportation of Taher and his nephew, Kubbawala. The police are also tracking Salim Dola, who is believed to be hiding in Turkey, having relocated there from the UAE after the deportation of his relatives between June and July of this year, IE reported. Mohammed Salim Mohammed Suhail Shaikh has confessed to Mumbai Police that he organised rave parties across India and abroad for film and fashion celebrities as well as gangsters.

The manager, who worked at a Nifty50 firm before being let go during a restructuring exercise, said the layoff came at the worst possible time: mere weeks after he exhausted his savings on a new home. Now, the property is rented out to cover EMIs while his financial buffer rapidly disappears. “My savings are depleting really fast… I have a runway of just two months,” he wrote, adding that despite paid LinkedIn and Naukri subscriptions, his job search has yielded almost nothing. “In seven months, I have only received a few calls from consultants and just two interviews.” Even industry connections, he said, have offered little help. “At this level, options are few. I’m okay with lower pay, but I’m not even getting calls. It’s all crashing down,” he wrote. The personal toll is equally heavy: “I have a family and everyone is so stressed.” His post resonated widely, with several commenters describing a similar slowdown in hiring for mid-career roles—particularly middle management positions that are being squeezed between entry-level talent and senior leadership. One user described being in the “same boat,” blaming automated resume filtering for rejections: “Recruiters ghosting, no calls. AI filters don’t care who you are. I only got callbacks after tailoring my resume using tools.” Another advised leaning on family assets in the interim: “If money is a challenge, liquidate ancestral land or gold. That’s what they’re meant for.” A third commenter called the current IT job market “brutal” and warned that volatility may persist. “One should always have multiple income sources,” he wrote, adding that he supplements his own income by trading Nifty options. “Multiple income streams are crucial today.” Stay updated with the l", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/its-all-crashing-down-iit-graduate-laid-off-from-70-lakh-nifty50-role-jobless-for-7-months-11763629520364.html", "timestamp": 1763633985.3206086}

For the first time in 100 years of Hindustan Times' history, the leading newspaper dedicated its entire front page to a single individual – a young man named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad who entered the Tamil film industry to change Indian cinema forever. It was “a tribute reserved for someone whose influence transcends cinema and becomes cultural mythology,” they said. Produced in collaboration with Amazon Prime Video , Hindustan Times turned its famous front page into “Rajinikanth Times,” a full-fledged tribute honouring the superstar's 50-year cinematic reign. The HT masthead was updated to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Thalaivar. The front page was transformed into a visual homage to Rajinikanth's five-decade journey, from Apoorva Raagangal (1975) to Jailer (2023). The newspaper also replaced its familiar seriousness of the broadsheet with a bold homage to the man whose on-screen swagger has shaped pop culture for fifty years. “50 years didn't make him a legend; he made the last 50 years legendary,” read the homage on the front page. “For a man who transcended language, geography, and generations, this front page feels less like newsprint and more like a milestone,” HT said about the tribute. The media house said that ‘Rajinikanth Times’ is more than a tribute to the actor's semicentennial — “It's history printed in ink. It’s proof that in a country where stars come and go, Rajinikanth remains eternal.” OTTplay was also a central component of Hindustan Times' initiative. The digital arm of the media house utilises an AI-powered discovery engine to offer over 30 OTT services through a single subscription, creating a virtual shrine for fans of Thalaivar.

The Independent Singapore reports that Ainie Haziqah, managing partner of Nurainie Haziqah & Co., shared the story on Threads. Her frank post, written in a mix of Malay and English, struck a real chord with users online. In her post, Haziqah said a lawyer at her firm came to her to resign because she needed to take care of her child, and thus could not handle the demanding schedule of her current job. Haziqah described the lawyer as someone she personally liked, professionally admired, and found “very teachable.” Instead of immediately accepting her resignation, Haziqah took time to consider if an alternative arrangement would work. After some deliberations, she proposed a flexible plan that would accommodate both the lawyer's family needs and her firm responsibilities. The solution enabled him to work full-time from home, attend office only for monthly meetings, and continue handling court cases as usual. “After a few weeks, she said yes. And Alhamdulillah, the arrangements went on for about 4-5 months, if I’m not mistaken. We worked together so naturally, it felt like the best way,” the post read.

A growing number are now considering relocating back to India. A recent discussion on Reddit highlighted this trend. A Non-Resident Indian (NRI) on an H1B visa — a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to temporarily employ foreign workers — with savings of ₹ 6 crore ($800,000), said he was contemplating a return to India. The user, aged 44, has been living in the US with his 42-year-old wife and their daughter, who will complete high school in about four years. He said the family planned to move back to India once her education is finished. In the post, he explained that although they hail from the national capital, they wish to settle in the southern part of the country due to its greenery, pleasant weather and slower pace of life. However, they are unsure whether they should be concerned about potential language barriers. “At present, our net worth in the US is around $800,000, which is roughly equivalent to ₹ 6 crore.

In an exclusive interview with the BBC , Sundar Pichai was asked if AI could pose a threat to all jobs, including his own job as a CEO. Pichai responded with a subtle smile. “I think what a CEO does is maybe one of the easier things, maybe for an AI to do one day,” he said. He recalled his statement from many years ago and said, \"AI is the most profound technology humanity has ever worked on, and it has potential for extraordinary benefits.\" Pichai said, \"We will have to work through societal disruptions.\" Pichai opined that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others—ramifications that mean “people will need to adapt.” The Google CEO said AI will end up creating new opportunities. \"As an example, like YouTubers, anybody will be able to create the content...It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt...,\" he said.

Pichai’s comments came as other tech CEOs predicted the coming of a new era of chief executive automations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously said AI will someday do his job better than him. He had said, “I will be nothing but enthusiastic the day that happens.” Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO of buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna, also said in a post on X earlier this year that “AI is capable of doing all our jobs, my own included.”  The two CEOs join another 49 percent o", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/googles-sundar-pichai-fears-ai-could-replace-ceos-one-day-maybe-one-of-the-easier-things-11763621576209.html", "timestamp": 1763633985.863231}

Normal match, normal chat, normal ‘where are you from’ energy. We talked for a day,” he said. But then, the next morning came a call from the mother of Umang's Bumble match. “Next morning, her MOM calls me. Yes. Her mother.” “She says, ‘Beta, I heard you do writing and marketing humare office ka page sambhal loge?’,” Umang, quoting his date's mother, shared. The netizens have called it the “chat of a lifetime”. The LinkedIn user thought he had misheard, but no. “She continued: ‘Beta, you seem sincere and unmarried, we can negotiate both things’,” he said. Umang joked, “I didn’t know whether this was a job interview, a marriage proposal, or a brand partnership.” Still trying to make sense of the conversation with the mother, the girl from Bumble texted Umang: “Sorry, my mom is extra. Ignore her.” However, the hilarious exchange did not end there. Her mom texted Umang again, asking, “Beta, do you take advance payment?” Since the Bumble date was still relatively new, Umang's own mother suggested that he politely talk to his date's mother, as she might be a good client. “My own mom saw the Truecaller name and said, ‘Talk nicely. Could be a good client’,” Umang shared. Confused about the situation, Umang said, “Now I don’t know who I’m dating. The daughter? The mother? Or the brand?” In a final update, Umang shared: “Guys, just to update you all, I got the client and date.” Social media users found the exchange very funny; however, they said that Umang was very lucky to have such odds. “First time in history: Aunty skipped ‘What are your plans with my daughter?’ and went straight to ‘What are your deliverables this quarter?’,” a user joked.

The move comes after the US Congress passed an Act to make all Epstein files public on Tuesday. As a result, the files related to all the cases involving the deceased sex offender will be released by the Department of Justice . The release of the files has been sought eagerly by both Trump’s political opponents as well as some members of the Republican Party, who have pressed for greater transparency in the matter. The documents may shed more light on Epstein’s activities. The late financier used to socialise with Trump and other notable figures before a 2008 conviction on charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution, Reuters reported. According to the BBC, the already-released files connected to Epstein include the names of prominent individuals such as Andrew, the Duke of Mountbatten Windsor, brother of King Charles, former US President Bill Clinton , and the late pop icon Michael Jackson. On 12 November, emails connected to the estate of Epstein were released. They featured the names of Larry Summers, the Treasury Secretary under President Clinton, and Steve Bannon, President Trump’s former aide. Other names that have emerged from the Epstein files include Michael Wolff, a senior journalist and author of several notable books; Kathryn Ruemmler, White House counsel under President Barack Obama; billionaire investor Peter Thiel; linguist and activist Noam Chomsky; publicist Peggy Siegel, and others. None of these individuals has been accused of any wrongdoing. All of them have said that their contacts with Epstein were non-controversial in nature.

In a post on Reddit , the techie shared an unfiltered account of his academic struggles, low confidence and the slow, often difficult path that eventually led to a breakthrough opportunity. The user wrote that he had scored 17 out of 360 in JEE Mains and secured 73% in Class 12, a phase he described as a sharp decline from being academically strong in school. “Tier-3 college, low confidence, no real personality,” he wrote, adding that college at least gave him “really good friends”. The pandemic, however, made things harder. He said Covid led to a long period of isolation — one that forced him to rebuild himself quietly and steadily. Despite limited expectations, he was placed at a service-based company with a salary of ₹ 7.4 lakh per annum. Over time, he switched to a startup where he earned ₹ 13.5 lakh a year. The turning point, he said, came unexpectedly. “One day, an Amazon recruiter reached out and I made it. ₹ 60 lakh a year.” But he emphasised that the salary jump is only part of the story. He described the personal changes that accompanied his career growth — developing confidence, improving his fitness and building a sense of identity he previously lacked. “Now I am someone with an athletic body, good humour, and a presence I never had before… I have not finally found myself, but I have found some of me. And that feels good.” Reddit users responded with encouragement and appreciation, calling the post relatable and motivating. Several highlighted the honesty in sharing both failures and self-doubt — aspects rarely visible behind high-paying tech jobs. A user asked, “Congratulations OP.

In a video, now viral on social media, Anwarul Haq, the former “Prime Minister” of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, is heard saying that terror groups linked to Pakistan carried out attacks “from the Red Fort to the forests of Kashmir”. Haq, who lost the no-confidence motion in the regional assembly, however, did not clearly mention whether he was referring to the November 10 car bomb attack in Delhi near Lal Quila , which left about 10 dead, including Dr Umar Nabi, a Kashmiri who was driving the car. “I earlier said that if you keep bleeding Balochistan, we'll hit India from Red Fort to the forests of Kashmir. By the grace of Allah, we've done it and they're still unable to count bodies,” Anwarul Haq is heard saying during a speech in the PoK Assembly. Clearly, Haq was referring to the Pahalgam attack in the Baisaran meadows of South Kashmir, where the attackers were from Pakistan. The attacker in the Delhi Red Fort was not from Pakistan, and the government has not officially established or suspected a role of Pakistan in the attack. Investigators, however, said that the Red Fort attack was a part of a larger “white-collar terror module” linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terror group based in Pakistan and founded by Masood Azhar, a UN-designated terrorist. Haq's statement comes amid Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif 's warning that Islamabad cannot ignore the possibility of an \"all-out war\" with India and that the country needs to be on \"full alert\". He said India cannot be trusted, adding that the country has been put on maximum alert for \"any border incursion\". “We cannot ignore (India) in any way...

Her revelation, coming days after she called a 3 a.m. staff meeting to prepare for a parliamentary session, has triggered fresh concerns about the country’s long-standing struggle with overwork. Appearing before a legislative committee, Takaichi said: “I sleep about two hours now, four hours at the longest. I feel it’s bad for my skin.” Her comments immediately set off criticism from opposition lawmakers and workers’ unions, who argued that Japan’s leader should be setting an example in promoting healthier work-life boundaries — not reinforcing extreme work habits. Japan’s overwork crisis is well documented. The country even has a dedicated term for deaths caused by excessive work: karōshi. The government is now reportedly considering raising the cap on overtime hours to boost economic growth, further fuelling concern among labour groups. According to the labour ministry, nearly 1 in 5 white-collar workers is at risk of overwork-related illnesses, including strokes, cardiac issues and severe mental stress. Alongside long hours, international workers in Japan often struggle with another aspect of the country’s workplace culture: hyper-polite, indirect communication. A viral Reddit post described it as “feedback so subtle it feels like a puzzle,” with employees rarely told directly whether their performance is good or poor. “No one ever says ‘good job’ or ‘you made a mistake’. It’s always: ‘Maybe next time, try a different way.’ It’s exhausting trying to read between the lines,” the user wrote. This style — rooted in tatemae, or maintaining social harmony — can leave newcomers feeling confused and anxious about their standing at work.

Porwal wrote that she was on a Rapido ride on Sunday night at around 9 pm when she initiated a conversation with her driver — a chat that ultimately dispelled the misconception that “people don’t want to work hard anymore.” Describing the driver as “cheerful and an extroverted personality”, she said they were having a casual conversation about life when she asked him about his full-time occupation: “Bhaiya, aap full-time ye karte ho?” The man smiled and explained that he works as a Swiggy delivery partner in the morning, drives for Rapido in the evening, and on weekends runs a local street food stall (pani puri vendor) with his brother. “I was stunned,” Porwal wrote. He told her, “Bas ma’am, thoda mehnat zyada hai, par ghar khushi se chal raha hai.” (“Ma’am, it’s just a little more hard work, but my household is running happily.”) Porwal said she was taken aback by his workload.

India launched ‘ Operation Sindoor ’—precision strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir—on May 7, in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack of 22 April 2025, in which 26 civilians, mostly tourists, were killed after terrorists opened fire at visitors in Baisaran meadow , a popular tourist spot near Pahalgam in Jammu & Kashmir’s Anantnag district. The USCC claim contradicts India’s stand on the conflict. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said India had showcased its capabilities during “Operation Sindoor” and brought Pakistan to its knees within a few hours. “While characterisation of this conflict as a ‘proxy war’ may overstate China’s role as an instigator, Beijing opportunistically leveraged the conflict to test and advertise the sophistication of its weapons, useful in the contexts of its ongoing border tensions with India and its expanding defence industry goals,” the report reads.

This year has been no different, with AQI readings once again forcing schools to shut and families to make difficult choices. Amid this, a thought-provoking LinkedIn post by Delhi-based Akshay Verma, Co-founder of FITPASS, has struck a chord with thousands of parents. In his post, Verma writes about how even his 3-year-old son now has to learn an unexpected new concept: AQI. “One week he’s learning how to hold a pencil… next week he’s learning why he can’t go to school because the air is ‘too poisonous’,” he writes, highlighting the surreal reality of parenting in the capital — where school closures have become as unpredictable as the smog itself. Verma points out how Delhi’s stop-start academic routine is increasingly dominated by sudden shutdowns. “Summer break, Diwali break — and now an annual ‘pollution break’ nobody wants to call by its real name,” he says. For a child who still thinks “clouds live inside cartoons,” he adds, trying to explain toxic air is both heartbreaking and absurd. Against this backdrop, Verma proposes a simple but radical rethink: Instead of the long summer break, he suggests a long winter break — from Diwali to January — when Delhi’s air quality consistently dips to its worst levels. Since heat can be managed but toxic air cannot, Verma argues that schools could operate smoothly through the summer and pause during the months when pollution routinely shuts the city down anyway. Doctors, he notes, are already advising families who can afford it to relocate to cleaner cities for 6 to 8 weeks during peak pollution. But for most households — including millions of working-class families — that isn’t an option. “They are forced to breathe whatever the city decides,” Verma writes.

Over the next 10 days, developments in the stratosphere are expected to reshape global weather patterns and may pave the way for a colder, snowier December across sections of the Northern Hemisphere. Several parts of the United States, currently enduring record-breaking heat just days before Thanksgiving, could soon see a dramatic reversal. Scientists say this could be one of the earliest significant disruptions to the polar vortex since satellites began monitoring it. Think of the stratospheric polar vortex as a fast-moving ring of wind that keeps the frigid Arctic air contained at the top of the world. When that ring weakens, icy air can plunge into regions such as the Lower 48, Europe and Asia. At present, temperatures high in the stratosphere — above the layer where everyday weather forms — are rising sharply during a phenomenon known as a sudden stratospheric warming event. Despite the name, the effect at the surface is often the opposite. Speaking with CNN, Amy H. Butler, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the warming aloft is weakening the polar vortex, and its winds could even reverse. Researchers still do not fully understand why these episodes occur, but they know the consequences can be severe: they often precede the strongest “polar vortex” cold outbreaks in the United States. Over the next fortnight, the impacts may begin to appear across North America , Europe and Asia as the disturbed vortex shifts southwards like a spinning top losing balance. Judah Cohen, a research scientist at MIT, notes that an event of this strength is highly unusual for November. Although a major winter outbreak is not guaranteed, forecasters are watching for below-average temperatures to develop in the world’s mid-latitudes over the next month.

The House Oversight Committee released more than 23,000 pages of records obtained from Epstein's estate last week. The release was extraordinary. Epstein had died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Those messages were scrutinised for new revelations about Epstein’s relationship with Trump. The records show Epstein relished talking about their one-time friendship as Trump rose to power.

Kuznietsov was detained on a European arrest warrant on Aug. 21 at a campground near the Adriatic coastal city of Rimini, where he was vacationing with his family. German prosecutors say that Kuznietsov organized and carried out the detonation of at least four bombs between 14 and 27 kilograms (around 31 to 62 pounds) at a depth of 70 to 80 meters (230 feet to 263 feet) in the Baltic Sea near the Danish island of Bornholm on Sept. 26, 2022, according to extradition documents. Kuznietsov has denied involvement in the explosions, saying he was in Ukraine where he was serving as an army captain at the time of the blasts. Poland has blocked the extradition to Germany of another suspect. Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news. Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart. Simply put, how international experience can benefit your career is by opening doors that domestic education often can’t.

Whether you’re heading to Europe, Asia, or anywhere in between, living and learning in a new culture offers you the chance to build skills that last a lifetime. So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success.
