The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

Singh commended UPSC’s ‘Pratibha Setu’ portal , which seeks to create new opportunities for candidates who have cleared the civil services examination stages but did not make it to the final selection, by connecting them with private sector and institutional openings. He termed the move “an innovative bridge between talent and opportunity,” ensuring that India’s intellectual potential is not lost but leveraged for national development. The minister also emphasised UPSC’s larger role beyond recruitment, framing and updating service rules, reviewing administrative practices, and setting ethical standards for public service.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

Awarded only after a meticulous review process, it certifies that an institution demonstrates exceptional quality across pedagogy, curriculum innovation, learning experience, and career impact. Additionally, the Ranchi-based Institute received recognition with the 4 Palmes of Excellence in the Eduniversal Best Business Schools Ranking 2025. The Eduniversal ranking system, which spans 154 countries and evaluates over 1,000 business schools, considers global influence, internationalisation, academic reputation, and the strength of institutional partnerships. The 4 Palmes of Excellence, awarded by the Eduniversal International Scientific Committee and endorsed through global peer voting by Deans, identify institutions with a strong and growing international impact. As IIM Ranchi continues to expand its global partnerships and deepen its engagement with international peers, the Institute remains steadfast in its mission to develop responsible, future-ready leaders. These recognitions reinforce its standing as one of the most respected and influential management institutions in the world today, and they signal the Institute’s determination to keep advancing the frontiers of management education.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021. Underlining the relevance of a single higher education regulator, the NEP-2020 document says, “The regulatory system needs a complete overhaul to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.” It adds that the new system should ensure the distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting are ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/winter-session-parliament-to-take-up-bill-replacing-ugc-aicte-ncte-with-single-regulator-10381204/", "timestamp": 1764304320.0243971}

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates.

The SSC is yet to publish the results for the tests of teachers’ recruitment to classes 9-10, where it is likely to follow the same marking pattern.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category. It sought a direction to the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education and School Federation of India Games to schedule the annual sports calendar (including all zonal, inter-zonal, state, and national tournaments, trials and coaching camps) for all outdoor sports in the capital during safer and less susceptible months with verifiably better ambient air quality. The petitioners said at the time of filing the plea, the city was under the Grade Response Action Plan-III (GRAP-III) emergency plan and risked escalation to GRAP-IV.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors.

He said 199 headmasters have honed their strategic and managerial skills at IIM Ahmedabad , and 144 primary teachers have completed an immersive training in Finland so far. He said these teachers, selected on merit, are expected to act as ‘master trainers,’ cascading their acquired knowledge and skills to their peers upon their return, thereby creating a multiplier effect throughout the state’s educational system. “This is not just a training programme. It’s a mission to transform Punjab’s future. By exposing our teachers to the finest educational ecosystems in the world, from Finland’s collaborative learning models to IIM Ahmedabad’s strategic leadership frameworks, we are ensuring that our students receive an education that is future-ready, holistic and on par with global standards.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764304335.6124947}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race.

Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion. European and East Asian universities are also in negotiations,” he said. As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.)

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have.

Dennis Green-Lieber, founder of AI-powered customer intelligence platform Propane , has had a front-row seat to that shift over the last 15 years. His take? The region’s social safety net gives founders room to take real swings without putting their personal lives on the line, and they’re accelerating faster than Silicon Valley as a result.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained.

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse.

Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup’s total funding to approximately $10 million. Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics. The company rebranded from Deft to Onton earlier this year, citing confusion around the original name and difficulty securing a premium domain. Zach Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. He added that the startup has observed that the average time a consumer takes to make a purchase decision has increased. For its core technology, the company uses what’s called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup’s model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description. “Let’s say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly.

Now, the human safety operator is gone.", "content": "A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless. The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen , Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving syste", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/25/uber-and-werides-robotaxi-service-in-abu-dhabi-is-officially-driverless/", "timestamp": 1764304621.9687114}

In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion , up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024. Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses. Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious , a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant. “Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch. Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny , SaaS.group , Arising Ventures , and Calm Capital , according to Dumont. “Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said. In 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment. Since then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel. “It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it.

Whether you’re stuck at home for the holidays and itching for something to play, or you just want to make sure you don’t let any hidden gems slip under your radar, here are five games from this year’s slate you should not miss. Courtesy of Yacht; Telefantasy Studios; Noble Robot If you’re in the mood for something a little out there, start with Blippo+ . First released in May on the handheld Playdate console, the game arrived on PC and Switch in September. At first blush, it’s a game about channel surfing. You browse different broadcasts, each of which feature bizarre, retro, live-action transmissions about a minute or so long, from nightly news and soap operas to quiz shows and fuzzy softcore. Every channel runs according to a schedule, which means you’ll need to decide which broadcasts to watch as they run live, and which to try again the next night. The more you watch, the easier it becomes to piece together the overall strange, sci-fi story of Blippo+ , which plays out across these endearingly weird channels. Think ‘80s TV show Max Headroom , but with those vibes sprinkled into everything—including the retro soundtrack by Jona Bechtolt of Yacht and the composer Rob Kieswetter. Blippo+ is one of the year’s most original games, so much so that it almost defies explanation. The less you know, the better. Best to embrace its absurdity by diving directly in.

The best smart glasses can entertain, guide us with directions, help us document our lives, and even teach us about the world around us, but the category is incredibly varied, and not all smart glasses have the same features. A computer you wear on your face has obvious potential, not least because it leaves your hands free. As yet another wave of smart glasses arrives , we got sneak-peek demos of several and tested just about everything on the market.

Not every pair of smart glasses is the same, as they can support wildly different functionality. Many can accommodate optical prescriptions, though they may require an additional tiny pair of lenses you wear inside the smart glasses. Some have diopter dials so you can adjust the focus separately for each eye. Some smart glasses are as simple as electrochromic (automatically darkening) sunglasses . They may not have other tech in them, but you may see them marketed as “smart glasses.” The most basic type of smart glasses you'll find are ones that act like portable screens. These often have displays or projectors to create a screen only the wearer can see, a series of floating windows, or a kind of heads-up display (HUD) layered on top of reality.

Previously, people outside of a server owner’s network could access the owner’s media library through Plex for free. Under the new rules announced in March, a server owner needs to have a Plex Pass subscription, which starts at $7 per month, to grant users remote access to their server. Alternatively, someone can remotely access another person’s Plex server by buying their own Plex Pass or a Remote Watch Pass , which is a subscription with fewer features than a Plex Pass and that Plex started selling in April for a $2 per month starting price. Plex’s new rules took effect on April 29. According to a recent Plex forums post by a Plex employee that How-To Geek spotted today, the changes are rolling out this week, with a subscription being required for people using Plex’s Roku OS app for remote access. The Plex employee added: This requirement change for remote streaming will come to all other Plex TV apps (Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, etc.) and any third-party clients using the API to offer remote streaming in 2026. Plex started as a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project in 2009 before evolving into a media server company and, more recently, a streaming service provider . Its new remote access rules will be a test for the company, which has been challenging long-time users with numerous changes over the past year, including a Plex Pass price hike, a foray into renting out officially licensed movies , and the introduction of social features and a mobile app redesign . Plex has previously emphasized its need to keep up with “rising costs,” which include providing support for many devices and codecs. It has also said it needs money to implement new features, including an integration with Common Sense Media , a new “bespoke server management app” for managing server users, and “an open and documented API for server integrations,”", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/plex-cracking-down-free-remote-streaming-access/", "timestamp": 1764304625.4954143}

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night. If you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, your hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfort trifecta. Many of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including director Martin Cizmar and reviewer Julia Forbes , a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a mattress and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each model to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one. We as a team have collectively spent years testing hundreds of mattresses. Of those hundreds of options, we whittled it down to our 10 that we wholeheartedly can say are the best mattresses for side sleepers. Be sure to check out our other sleep guides, including Best Mattresses , Best Organic Mattresses , and the Best Body Pillows for Side Sleepers . Updated November 2025: We’ve selected the Saatva Rx as our top pick for sleepers with joint pain, and deemed Bear Elite Hybrid to be our firm mattress pick for side sleepers.

Are the branches strong enough to hold that lopsided homemade macaroni ornament you’ve hung on your tree since 2004? We got tired of guessing, so we did a little experiment. We brought 10 of the most popular artificial trees from three top brands (Balsam Hill, King of Christmas, and National Tree Company) and hauled them to a photo studio in Kansas. There, 10 volunteer assemblers spent a morning unboxing, building, and fluffing every tree, and three professional interior designers scored them. The judges didn’t know the brands. They didn’t know the prices. They didn’t even speak to the assemblers about how the construction of each tree went. They evaluated each tree based solely on how it looked and felt. After our day of testing, we allowed every assembler the chance to take their tree home and set it up for their family. Most did and shared their notes. We’ve added their feedback on how the assembly process went at home, plus photos of the fully decorated trees. For more holiday hosting help from WIRED, check out our Dedicated Server package.

Rather than needing to copy and paste passwords from your password manager to other apps (which puts your password on the clipboard at least for a moment), 1Password is integrated with many apps and can autofill. This is more noticeable on iOS, where inter-app communication is more restricted. You can get savings on the company’s suite of products with our 1Password coupons and deals.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications.

This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro.

Sony's top-of-the-line mirrorless camera, the A7R V, is on sale at the lowest price we've ever seen. If you've been thinking of updating, now is the time to buy. The A7R V isn't our top-pick mirrorless camera, but that's mainly because at full price it's expensive relative to the rest of the market. At this price, though, it's a steal, maybe even one of the absolute best Black Friday deals , and while there is no truly best camera for everyone, the A7R V is unquestionably the highest-resolution camera you can buy. And I know, megapixels aren't everything, but I have never taken an image with this camera and thought, darn, that's just too many megapixels. Sony Amazon Adorama B&H Photo The massive 61-megapixel, full-frame sensor in the A7R V is the largest sensor you can get without moving up to a bigger, bulkier medium-format camera. If you want to go totally nuts, get this, landscape photographers: The A7R V can combine 16 shots into a single 240-MP image. It only works with static subjects, but if you ever worried if your images are hi-res enough to cover the side of a building in Times Square, well, you can rest easy with the A7R V. Yes, the megapixel race is silly and mostly over, but I will say that I've shot quite a bit with the A7R C—which uses the same sensor—and images from this 60-MP sensor are noticeable sharper, and the dynamic range is visibly better than what I get from the A7R II (which has a 40-MP sensor). This is obviously the case onscreen, when pixel peeping, but I also notice the difference when I print images. That the A7R V is $900 off does make you wonder if perhaps the A7R VI is on the horizon? Anything is possible, but I kind of doubt it's coming imminently. The A7C R, which as noted above, is nearly identical in features, is still not on sale.

Lobbyists are pitching a subscription service instead.", "content": "Right to repair provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act , which would secure funding for the US military in 2026, are likely to be struck from the final language of the bill despite enjoying broad bipartisan support, sources familiar with ongoing negotiations tell WIRED. They say that provisions in the act enabling servicemembers to repair their own equipment are likely to be removed entirely, and replaced with a data-as-a-service subscription plan that benefits defense contractors. The right to repair has become a thorny issue in the military. If a drone, fighter jet, or even a stove on a Navy vessel fails, US servicemembers in the field can't always fix it themselves. In many cases, they need to call a qualified repair person, approved by the manufacturer, and bring them out to the site to fix the problem. The military would love to sidestep that hassle by giving personnel the tools and materials to make their own repairs in the field, and has repeatedly called for Congress to enable it to do so. However, some in Washington have been trying to neuter proposed right-to-repair provisions—a move that has been advocated for by defense contractor groups who sell the military the stuff they want to fix as well as the means to fix it, and stand to lose if the military is empowered to perform its own repairs. Differing versions of the NDAA have passed the Senate and the House and the process is now in a conferencing phase, where lawmakers meet to combine the versions into one bill. The final language is expected to come through by next week; after votes in both houses of Congress, it will then go to president Donald Trump’s desk to be signed into law.

In attendance was Sherjil Ozair, a late addition who had previously held senior research roles at DeepMind and Tesla . The following day, Bajaj and Ozair were on their way to making a deal, public records show. Bajaj didn’t mention it at the dinner, but earlier this year he had begun working with Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos on a new AI venture called Project Prometheus. Backed by $6.2 billion in funding, including from Bezos, Project Prometheus is working on AI systems that can support the manufacturing of computers, cars, and even spacecraft, according to two people familiar with the startup who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The project has brought on over 100 employees, including Ozair and a handful of colleagues who previously worked at his agentic AI startup General Agents, which has now been acquired by Project Prometheus. Last week, The New York Times revealed the first details about Prometheus, including that Bezos and Bajaj will serve as co-CEOs. But its acquisition of General Agents hasn’t been previously reported. Corporate filings in Delaware obtained by WIRED show that Bajaj, who previously cofounded Alphabet’s health sciences company Verily , formed an entity to acquire General Agents the morning after the San Francisco dinner. It merged with Ozair’s startup four days later. Terms of the deal could not be learned. The records list General Agents’ new address as the San Francisco headquarters of Foresite Labs, a Bajaj-led biotech incubator.

Four members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice tell WIRED that they began asking workers to sign the letter last month. After reaching their initial goal, the group published on Wednesday the job titles of the Amazon employees who signed and disclosed that more than 2,400 supporters from other organizations, including Google and Apple, have also joined in. Backers inside Amazon include high-ranking engineers, senior product leaders, marketing managers, and warehouse staff spanning many divisions of the company. A senior engineering manager with over 20 years at Amazon says they signed because they believe a manufactured “race” to build the best AI has empowered executives to trample workers and the environment. “The current generation of AI has become almost like a drug that companies like Amazon obsess over, use as a cover to lay people off, and use the savings to pay for data centers for AI products no one is paying for,” says the employee, who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from their bosses.

Now newly released satellite images of the targeted KK Park scam center reveal that only buildings in one limited section of the compound were destroyed during the initial raids. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.” High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place. However, the images show the destruction is, so-far, confined to the Eastern side of the gigantic compound—with hundreds of buildings across the vast compound being left untouched. Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. They also raise concerns about the welfare of thousands of people forced to run scams in KK Park. “The junta is making it sound as though they’re taking down the entire compound, and the imagery that we have seen so far is only limited to one section,” says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization. “It’s important to keep monitoring this to verify what they’re actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they’re actually cracking down on the real problem.” The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings.

That's right, Apple's biggest and baddest headphones are marked down to just $400 at both Best Bu y and Amazon . Apple Amazon Apple Even for the steep price tag, the audio quality on the AirPods Max is nothing short of incredible. When WIRED writer Parker Hall reviewed them initially , he called them “the best-sounding wireless headphones [he's] ever heard, and by a significant margin.” Even when stacked up against the big hitters from Bose and Sony, they have an impressively open soundstage, letting details shine in every genre, from highly-produced pop to soft jazz. The active noise canceling is extremely potent as well, with a pass-through mode that's sharp and clear. As long as you're in the Apple ecosystem, these have an impressive level of features and excellent coordination between devices. Like most AirPods, simply hold them near your iPhone or iPad and they'll connect right away, no extensive pairing or app installations. Because they're always running in a low-power state, you can remove them from their little case or put them on your head, and they'll connect to the closest iOS device and start playing.

If you’re a hot sleeper, a cooling mattress may be for you. Waking up sweaty and hot can be caused by several factors, like sleeping conditions, stress, excessive blankets, the wrong pajamas, and even eating spicy foods before bed. Hot nights can also equate to sleepless nights. According to a study from the Journal of Physiological Anthropology , heat exposure increases wakefulness and decreases time spent in deep sleep and REM sleep. A cooling mattress is built specifically to help regulate your body temperature by being made of materials that optimize airflow and draw heat away from your body as you sleep. I (and some of my sweatiest colleagues) tested a myriad of cooling mattresses for at least a week each in our homes—to determine which worked best to beat the heat.

Experts say this could lead to the fast approval of new types of forever chemicals—with limited oversight.", "content": "In recent months, the Trump administration has opened a deregulatory floodgate in the name of building more data centers . Among other things, this has involved ordering rollbacks of clean water regulations and opening up public lands to coal mining. Now, it’s turning its eye to chemical regulation with a new policy that could, experts say, potentially fast-track the approval of new chemicals for use in the US—including new types of forever chemicals—with limited oversight. In September, the EPA announced it would be prioritizing the regulatory review of new chemicals used in data centers or related projects. The announcement is part of a sweeping set of overhauls pushed by the Trump administration following several executive orders related to AI and a White House AI Action Plan, both rolled out in July. The Action Plan was formed after soliciting more than 10,000 public comments, which included hundreds from industry interests. These actions, the White House has said, will usher in a “golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance.” “I think they want to impose as few restrictions as possible on chemicals,” says Greg Schweer, who served as the EPA chief of the new chemicals management branch between 2008 and 2020. “In previous administrations, political people stayed out of [chemical regulation]—they tried to let science win. Here, the industry has a willing set of ears that wants to listen to their opinions.” September’s announcement was part of a larger push to expedite new chemical reviews at the EPA. The new chemical review process underwent a significant reform in 2016; in the decade since, a backlog of chemical reviews has piled up at the agency, garnering complaints from industry and bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. Clearing out that backlog has been a priority of Trump’s second-term EPA.

Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars. Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough) .

Carrying several types of phones, tablets, keyboards, and other tech gear, OnePlus uses an Android-based operating system, is universally unblocked and works with all US carriers. We know how important your tech purchases are (duh, we’re WIRED) and we have a OnePlus promo code to help you save. OnePlus Black Friday sales promise hundreds of dollars and huge savings on some of our favorite WIRED-tested tech. This means slashed prices, like the OnePlus 13 for $700 ($200 off), the OnePlus Watch 3 for $250 ($100 off), and the OnePlus 12 for $900. On November 13, the anticipated OnePlus 15 is launching, with new buzz-worthy features and improvements on the already-polished tech from techy fan favorite, OnePlus. It’s true what they say: the early bird gets the worm. When you subscribe today for OnePlus newsletters and information about the latest drops, you can get $50 off or a chance to win the OnePlus Pad 3 for free. And, if you decide on the OnePlus 13 instead, you can get a Black Eclipse12 GB RAM with 256 GB ROM for $900, and get a free gift with purchase. As mentioned, we at WIRED love OnePlus because of the affordable price point while maintaining solid quality. The newest iteration of the OnePlus 12 impressed us. One of the biggest drawbacks in previous models was the camera quality, but OnePlus has done a lot of work to improve it in the past few years and it’s now on level with competitors like Samsung. Our senior reviews editor and tech overlord Julian Chokkattu called the newest iteration a “Very Good Phone” (high praise from him). It also charges with blazing speed. We also made a bold statement about the OnePlus Pad , whose existence we (perhaps polarizing) said “proves that Android tablets don’t have to suck”—and still think it’s a worthy iPad alternative, especially at a fair price point in the $4", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/oneplus-promo-code/", "timestamp": 1764304633.1046538}

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate. We also raise our EBITDA margin by 150-10bps on the margin beat.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

Outlook HDFC Life (HDFCLI) has successfully worked its way to improve bancassurance as well as agency while focusing on SURU markets (semi-urban and rural) in FY24. This has led to 13% YoY growth in tier 2/3 locations while overall NoP has grown 11% YoY in FY24.

This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

A post on social media has gone viral after a Delhi-based user pointed out that a flight ticket from the national capital to Leh was cheaper than taking a cab from Gurugram to Greater Noida. Sharing screenshots to prove his point, the user — Aaraynsh — showed that a SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Leh was priced at ₹ 1,540, while an Uber ride for the cross-city commute quoted a fare of ₹ 1,952.61. “Today, flying from Delhi to Ladakh is cheaper than taking a cab from Gurgaon to Greater Noida,” he wrote on X (formerly Twitter), sparking a sharp discussion online. While many users expressed frustration over the increasingly steep cab fares in NCR — especially during peak hours — some pointed out that it is currently the off-season for Ladakh, which could be why the airfare appeared unusually low. A user joked, “Because Delhi to leh - 2 hours, Gurgaon to GN - 3.5 hours.” “Sometime Delhi to Leh is ₹ 15,000 ticket. Abhi may be less as Leh has sub zero temperatures in winter and no water. So no one goes there in winter,” another user wrote. The third user questioned, “Imagine planes are more affordable than cabs. Is this progress or a joke?” Several factors contribute to the fare surge, especially in metro cities like Delhi-NCR: From memes to genuine concerns about affordability, the conversation continues to highlight a growing sentiment among commuters: road travel in NCR is increasingly expensive — sometimes more expensive than hopping on a plane.

The project defies basic architectural norms and reflects Trump’s preference for oversized, attention-grabbing designs. His demand for a 90,000-square-foot addition has put him at odds with architect James McCrery II, who has urged restraint, warning that the new structure could overshadow the 55,000-square-foot White House. He stressed the core rule of architecture: an addition should never dwarf the main building. Despite the disagreements, characterised by a White House official as “constructive dialogue\" between Trump and McCrery, the administration remains excited to execute what it believes will be the “greatest addition to the White House since the Oval Office,” the official told WaPo . The Trump administration has not publicly provided key details about the structure, such as its planned height. The 90,000-square-foot structure is also expected to host a suite of offices previously located in the East Wing. The ballroom plan represents one of the largest changes to the White House in its 233-year history. Trump's singular belief in himself as a tastemaker and obsessive attention to details have led to him micromanaging the project, holding frequent meetings about its design and materials, multiple administration officials confirmed. A model of the ballroom has also become a regular fixture in the Oval Office . The project's pace, secrecy and shifting specifications have drawn criticism, especially from Democrats, some architects and historical preservation groups, as it has yet to undergo any formal public review. As of Tuesday, plans for the addition had not been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, a 12-member board charged by Congress with overseeing federal construction projects and now led by Trump allies.

This guidance follows the Trump administration's decision to suspend refugee resettlement from Afghanistan and to restrict the entry of Afghan nationals during its first year in office. Blaming the incident on the Joe Biden administration, the statement read, “This (vetting) includes an assessment of where they are coming from and why.

Later, an AI agent corrected the email, admitting it disclosed confidential discussions by mistake. In a post on the social media platform X, Vembu wrote, “I got an email from a startup founder, asking if we could acquire them, mentioning some other company interested in acquiring them and the price they were offering.” He added, \"Then I received an email from their \"browser AI agent\" correcting the earlier mail saying “I am sorry I disclosed confidential information about other discussions, it was my fault as the AI agent.”   Vembu experienced one of the several incidents that have reportedly been caused by the use of AI. With the widespread use of AI across industries and everyday applications, several users have often flagged different types of errors. These include factual incorrectness, sharing more information than what is actually asked for, biased outputs, misreading context, inconsistent results and many more. These concerns highlight that, although AI tools have become increasingly common, they still require human oversight to ensure reliability. Several social media users have reacted to Vembu's post, with most of them raising concerns over errors generated by AI tools. One of the users wrote, “This is exactly why AI agents need guardrails. One slip, and suddenly the ‘helper bot’ is leaking acquisition terms. We’re entering a phase where AI won’t just draft emails — it’ll accidentally start negotiations.” Another user took a funny jibe and said, “If you were also using an AI agent, all conversations will be between agents only and mistakes will remain between agents if agents were forgiving within their fraternity 😄.”  Meanwhile, a user refused to believe that the incident was an AI error and said, “This is not AI, this is an old school method of business.” Another user wrote, “Looks like the AI has better etiquette t", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/sridhar-vembu-shares-bizarre-startup-acquisition-pitch-leaking-rival-offer-ai-takes-the-blame-later-11764290665800.html", "timestamp": 1764304699.9044025}

He is seen brandishing a gun before the ambush that killed one National Guard member and injured another, according to Russia Today citing release by The Wall Street Journal. Law enforcement officials told AP and other media outlets that the suspected shooter was an Afghan citizen who arrived in the United States in September 2021. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday that she would pursue the death penalty if either of the shooting victims died. Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for DC, said at a Thursday press conference that the suspect faces three counts of attempted murder while armed, according to Bloomberg . US President Donald Trump , Vice President JD Vance, and other administration figures quickly blamed the Biden administration for allowing Lakanwal into the country. They used the case to advocate for stricter immigration measures, including pausing reviews of Afghan immigration cases and re-examining those already in the US, potentially limiting settlement rights for Afghan allies of US forces. On Thursday, Trump also slammed the Biden administration’s handling of evacuation flights that carried Afghan asylum seekers during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. During his Thanksgiving call to US troops , Trump announced that Sarah Beckstrom, 20, had died, and that Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life\". “She's just passed away. She's no longer with us. She's looking down at us right now. Her parents are with her,\" Trump said. The president described Beckstrom as an “incredible person, outstanding in every single way.” Trump called the shooting a “terrorist attack” and suggested that the shooter became mentally unstable following the war and his departure from Afghanistan. “He went cuckoo.

However, he did not share the specifics of his plans to nearly eliminate income tax. Notably, this is not the first time Donald Trump has claimed that the imposition of tariffs will result in a significant decline in income tax for many Americans. “When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,” Trump said in a Truth Social post in April this year. After returning to the White House earlier this year, Trump announced tariffs on trading partners , which impose taxes ranging from 10% to 50% on most US imports, depending on their country of origin. He claimed that these tariffs would increase government revenue and encourage consumers to purchase more American-made goods. The US president, who has often defended whopping tariffs on trading partners, proposed a tariff dividend to Americans earlier this month. He called out people who criticised tariffs and pledged a dividend of at least $2,000 per person, excluding high-income individuals.

The quake struck at 8:11 am about 26 miles southwest of Willow and roughly 37 miles from Anchorage, according to the Alaska Earthquake Center. The US Geological Survey (USGS) recorded the 6.0 magnitude quake at a shallow depth of 42.8 miles (69 km). So far, there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. However, several residents took to social media platforms to share videos of widespread shaking. “We have reviewed a magnitude 6.0 event that occurred at 08:11 AM AK time, northwest of Anchorage and at 43 miles depth. This event was felt widely throughout south-central Alaska, and as far as Fairbanks,” said Alaska Earthquake Center. No tsunami is expected, the National Tsunami Center said. More than 4,600 residents of Alaska reported feeling shaking, according to the \"Did You Feel It\" page on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website. The strongest earthquakes in Southcentral Alaska are generated by the megathrust fault that marks the contact zone between the subducting Pacific and overriding North American plates. On average, Alaska experiences half a dozen magnitude 6 or greater earthquakes per year. Coastal Alaska communities also face the additional hazard of tsunamis caused by earthquakes or landslides. Several residents took to X to inform that they felt the earthquake on Thanksgiving Day. “Happy Thanksgiving, Alaska! Did we all enjoy the Earthquake. Nothing much. It was a fun ride, about 30 secs. Grateful for strong communities, epic feasts, and the reminder to hug loved ones tighter,” said an X user. “Fine I’ll get up on my day off,” said another. “A strong earthquake has shaken Alaska north of Anchorage this morning (time displayed is Pacific time).

Kochhar, director general of COAI, said in a statement. Kochhar said obtaining verifiable consent for users under 18 poses practical challenges for operators, and runs counter to the digital autonomy promoted by several government initiatives. COAI had suggested a practical exemption for minors aged 16–18 for SIM acquisition, which means that without going through verifiable parental consent, these age group can get the SIM card issued. For users under 18, companies will need to seek “verifiable” parental consent before using their data.

The initiative is budgeted at 2 billion euros ($2.32 billion). Macron outlined the scale of the program: -3,000 participants in 2026 -10,000 participants by 2030 -Ambition to reach 50,000 youth by 2035, depending on evolving threats After completing the program, participants may integrate into civilian life, join as reservists, or continue in the armed forces. Macron emphasized that the new program will not involve mandatory service, affirming the decision of former President Jacques Chirac to scrap conscription in 1996. “We cannot return to the time of conscription,” Macron said. “This hybrid army model corresponds to the threats and risks ahead, bringing together national service youth, reservists, and the active army.” The French military aims to increase its reserve force to 100,000 by 2030, up from the current 47,000, bringing the total military force to approximately 210,000. Poll data cited by Macron’s aides suggests strong backing for the armed forces among 18- to 25-year-olds, reinforcing the timing of the initiative.

The Union ministries of corporate affairs, and housing and urban affairs were part of Thursday’s meeting with the parliamentary committee, led by Bharatiya Janata Party's Lok Sabha member Baijayant Panda. A revised bill based on the select committee’s report is likely to be tabled in Lok Sabha either in the second or third week of December, after the government secures cabinet approval, paving the way for the reform, said the first of the two persons cited earlier, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. The parliament session will commence on 1 December, and run till 19 December. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025 seeks to introduce a cross-border insolvency regime, allow partial asset sale of bankrupt businesses, permit a largely out-of-court debt resolution for well-regulated financial creditors, and facilitate early debt settlement with lenders by distressed businesses.

A bench of Chief Justice Shree Chandrashekhar and Justice Gautam Ankhad was requested to resume hearings on a series of petitions filed in 2023 concerning the city’s air pollution problem, PTI reported. Senior counsels Darius Khambata and Janak Dwarkadas, appearing for the petitioners, said the AQI in the city has been consistently poor and above 300 this month. Additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan said air pollution has worsened due to the volcanic eruption in Ethiopia two days back. The court, however, discarded this and said air pollution has been bad much before the eruption of the volcano. “Even before this eruption, if one stepped out visibility was poor beyond 500 metres,” the court said. The bench, while referring to the situation in Delhi , which is witnessing alarming levels of AQI, asked what effective measures can be taken to address the issue. \"What can be the most effective measures? We are all seeing what is happening in Delhi? What is the effect of that,\" the bench questioned, as reported by PTI. The court posted the matter for hearing on Friday. Hayli Gubbi, a shield volcano in Ethiopia's Afar region, erupted on Sunday, producing a large ash plume that rose to around 14 kilometres (45,000 feet) in the sky. The plume spread eastward across the Red Sea and towards the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent. High-level winds carried the ash cloud from Ethiopia across the Red Sea, Yemen, Oman, the Arabian Sea and then towards western and northern India, the India Meteorological Department said in a statement. Meanwhile, Mumbai's air quality remains troubling, with recent data showing an overall AQI in the “unhealthy” category (around 250) as of Thursday.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025?

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764304732.2394683}

When you’re planning a semester abroad, figuring out what to pack for a semester abroad can feel overwhelming. Unlike a short trip, a semester abroad requires careful thought — you need enough items to last months but want to avoid lugging heavy bags everywhere. Learning how to pack light for a semester abroad helps you strike the perfect balance between preparation and convenience. A minimalist mindset is key when it comes to packing for long-term travel. Use a minimalist packing list to guide you through the essentials. Prioritize versatile clothing that can be mixed and matched according to the season and weather where you’ll be studying abroad. Some things everyone needs when studying abroad for a semester include: To master how to pack lightly, use space-saving hacks like rolling clothes instead of folding, using packing cubes, and wearing your bulkiest items on the plane.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart.
