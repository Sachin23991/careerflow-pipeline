Railway RRB NTPC Result & Group D City Intimation Slip 2025 LIVE: Check here Over 1.08 crore candidates awaiting clarity, the timeline of events offers a clear picture of how the process unfolded and what was pending. For more details on RRB Group D 2025 exam date, city intimation slip and admit card, candidates can check the IE Education portal . The RRB Group D application and modification phases were completed in early 2025 without any disruption. In August, the RRBs issued the first major update – announcing a tentative computer-based test (CBT) schedule. It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts. The ruling lifted all legal barriers and gave RRBs a clear path to conduct the exam. However, the delay caused by the litigation meant that the originally planned November – December schedule was no longer feasible. RRBs is likely to release a revised exam schedule today.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category. It sought a direction to the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education and School Federation of India Games to schedule the annual sports calendar (including all zonal, inter-zonal, state, and national tournaments, trials and coaching camps) for all outdoor sports in the capital during safer and less susceptible months with verifiably better ambient air quality. The petitioners said at the time of filing the plea, the city was under the Grade Response Action Plan-III (GRAP-III) emergency plan and risked escalation to GRAP-IV.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

IIE, a not-for-profit headquartered in New York, Monday released a fall 2025 snapshot survey on international student enrolment at 825 higher education institutions in the US. Around 57 per cent of these institutions reported a decrease in new international student enrolments for the 2025-26 academic year, while 14 per cent reported stable numbers, and 29 per cent indicated an increase.

These declines in new enrollment from India are likely driving the overall national declines in new enrollment,” the report on the fall 2025 session noted. In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals. While 96 per cent of institutions cited the visa application process as a factor in the decline of new international student enrolment this year, this figure was only 64 per cent in the fall of 2021, and was at 85 per cent last year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process. The 2021 board exams were significantly delayed, starting on May 17 and ending on May 26. This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years. By 2023, the Telangana SSC exams returned closer to the usual time frame, being held from April 3 to April 13. The shorter, 11-day window helped the board align future sessions with the pre-pandemic calendar. The 2024 exams were conducted from March 18 to April 2, indicating a complete return to the standard March schedule. The examination period stretched over 16 days, giving students a familiar timetable after several disrupted years.

As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763533286.0370839}

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject.

Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete.

Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”.

WaterSense, developed by Polish PhD candidate Filip Budny from the Warsaw University of Technology, won in the Sustainability category. The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible.

Typically, you identify some key chapters, and there are around 20 per cent of chapters that contain 80 per cent of the question paper, meaning 80 per cent of the questions are from those 20 per cent of chapters alone. If you cover those chapters properly, you may not need to study the rest. I am not saying the numbers are accurate, but you can get the point that if we cover some important chapters, we can get more marks than trying to cover all chapters equally. We should be smart about our study, and try to have some expertise on some key chapters. In fact, we may have to identify topics in those chapters and then try and figure out from PYQ’s, which ones get repeated more. On that note, we can take a look at which chapters we should focus on.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Nearly half of them believe their roles AI can make a switch in their jobs within the next three to five years. According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations. Among those worried that artificial intelligence could replace their roles, at least 40% are actively considering an exit.

She clarified that she had no formal association with the institute and had only attended a mock interview at Chahal Academy, which she later learned was jointly conducted with Dikshant IAS.

During my drop year, I joined a coaching in Kota and studied nearly six to eight hours a day. I never enjoyed inorganic chemistry, but my biggest challenge wasn’t the syllabus – it was maintaining consistency under pressure. There were moments of burnout and self-doubt, but my parents and teachers encouraged me to push through. But now, when I look back, I feel it was all worth it.

Small mistakes in these final days can undo months of efforts – countless practice, revision on the loop, repeated mock attempts and performance analysis – all can go into vain. It happens with the best of the best. The following is the list of the most common mistakes aspirants make close to the CAT and how you can avoid them – walking into the exam with focus and confidence. In the final stretch, many aspirants fall into the “more mocks = more improvement” trap. This happens especially with the ones who start their preparation late. Many of the aspirants start writing a full-length mock every day or worse, trying to attempt two mocks a day. This process does more harm than good. This leads to a drop in accuracy (result of inadequate post mock analysis), fatigue build up and drop in confidence. Reduce mock frequency to 2-3 per week and focus on deep analysis. Ask yourself questions like: Which questions did I choose wrongly? Did I waste time on a trap set? Did I panic midway? You need to chase understanding rather than scores and focus on exam attempt strategy. In the process of trying to cover left over topics, strengthening certain topics, attempting more than required mocks – candidates often miss adequate revision. They keep taking tests without revising their basics – forgetting one small formula or concept mid-exam can cost valuable marks. Well, the right course is to create a formula/trick/revision book while you are covering the concepts. If that is not done, create one quickly. Spend 20-30 minutes, 3-4 days a week revisiting these notes and updating them. The goal isn’t to learn new things – it’s to make your brain recall old things (Formulas, patterns, logics) instantly. Aspirants need to understand that it is normal for mock scores to fluctuate. In the last 3-4 weeks, many students lose confidence because of this.

The minister added that nearly 500 schools are expected to come under the ambit of the Directorate of Education (DoE), which would ensure legitimacy, regulatory oversight and accountability. Each year, the Directorate receives around 2 lakh applications under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Disadvantaged Groups (DG), and Children With Special Needs (CWSN) categories for approximately 40,000 seats, many of which remain vacant due to the shortage of recognised schools. The new recognition policy is expected to create about 20,000 additional seats, expanding equitable access to education, the minister said.

Indians spent $50.25 million on education in Georgia in 2024-25, a nearly five-fold surge from $10.33 million in 2018-19, according to data on Reserve Bank of India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), obtained under the RTI Act. This rise, the LRS data shows, has come largely at Ukraine’s expense, with Indian remittances for education there dropping from $14.80 million in 2018-19 to just $2.40 million in 2024-25. In the years before the war, Indian remittances for education in Ukraine were rising. In fact, Ukraine was among the top 10 destinations for Indian students in 2020-21 and 2021-22, when remittances touched $39.12 million. This fell sharply to about $10.6 million in 2022-23, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The same year, 2022-23, Georgia entered the list of top 15 countries to which Indians sent money for education abroad — ranking 14th, a significant jump from its 21st position in 2018-19. The country has since moved up to the 12th place. According to data submitted in Parliament in December last year on the number of Indians who disclosed their purpose as ‘study/education’ while going abroad, there were 4,148 such Indians who went to Georgia in 2019. This number rose to 10,470 in 2023. According to Foreign education consultants, Georgia was already popular for medical and paramedical courses such as physiotherapy, but it gained substantially after the war began as students avoided Ukraine and those already enrolled in medical courses there sought transfers to universities in Georgia.

In September, Ram canceled plans to produce a battery-electric full-size pickup , opting to focus on bringing an extended-range Ram 1500 REV to market. A month later, Stellantis announced it would invest $13 billion to beef up its U.S. manufacturing over the next four years as part of a broader revival plan directed by its new CEO.

The energy company said last year it would reopen the reactor , which had been shuttered since 2019, after Microsoft committed to purchasing all the electricity from the 835 megawatt power plant for two decades. Constellation estimated the project would cost $1.6 billion, and it expects to complete the refurbishment in 2028. Terms of Microsoft’s deal with Constellation weren’t disclosed. Analysts at Jefferies have estimated the tech company might be paying about $110 to $115 per megawatt-hour over 20 years of the deal. That’s cheaper than a brand-new nuclear power plant would cost, but it’s a hefty premium over wind, solar, and geothermal, according to a comparison of energy costs from Lazard. Even wind and solar projects outfitted with utility-scale batteries to enable 24/7 power are cheaper. Nonetheless, tech companies have recently fallen in love with nuclear as power demands for their data centers and AI efforts have skyrocketed. This summer, Microsoft competitor Meta signed its own deal with Constellation, buying the “clean energy attributes” of a 1.1 gigawatt nuclear power plant in Illinois. The reactor at Three Mile Island that’s being restarted isn’t the infamous Unit 2, which melted down in 1979.

But this year’s edition goes beyond the usual assessment of the tech ecosystem; it has become a piece of advocacy that reflects a broader shift: European startups and investors are increasingly turning to lobbying. “It’s no longer enough to show how far we’ve come. It’s critical, too, that we use those insights to point the way forward,” said the report’s author, Tom Wehmeier, who is also a partner at Atomico and the firm’s head of intelligence. This includes four policy recommendations with fairly self-explanatory names: Fix the friction, Fund the future, Empower talent, and Champion risk. While Atomico is using answers from a wide range of respondents to advocate for these specific recommendations, it arguably has some authority to speak for more than itself. Founded in 2006 by Skype co-founder Niklas Zennström, its portfolio includes high-profile European companies such as Aiven, DeepL, Klarna, Pipedrive, Stripe, and Supercell. Taking a page from Big Tech and from legacy industries, as well as from their U.S. peers , European tech companies of that scale are increasingly learning to lobby for themselves — at the company level, with public affairs hires, but also collectively, with open letters that European institutions have paid attention to. This also explains why many of Atomico’s recommendations align with topics that are already very much in the air, both in the startup community and in the Brussels policy world — whether it is the 28th regime proposed by advocacy group EU-INC to create a pan-European company structure (currently, companies must navigate 27 different national regimes), calls for less regulation, or broader considerations on competitiveness that echo former European Central Bank president Mario Draghi’s 2024 report .

A spokesperson with Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) told TechCrunch the automaker applied for a Transportation Network Company (TNC) permit on November 13. Tesla met the requirements to operate as a TNC and is permitted as of November 17, according to ADOT. The permit is the final regulatory step to launch a robotaxi service in Arizona, a state that has become a hub of autonomous vehicle technology testing and development. Waymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving company and the dominant robotaxi provider in the U.S., has operated a service in the Phoenix area since 2018 . Today, Waymo robotaxis cover a service area of 315 square miles in the greater Phoenix metro area. Under Arizona state law, companies apply and then follow a self-certification process to test autonomous vehicles with or without a driver. But that doesn’t allow the company to operate a robotaxi service that charges for rides. Any company that wants to operate a ride-hailing service, human or robot driven, must apply for a Transportation Network Company permit. In June, Tesla contacted the Arizona Department of Transportation regarding autonomous vehicle ride-sharing services to begin the certification process. The company expressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area, a spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time. Tesla later applied for both autonomous vehicle testing/operating with a driver and testing/operating without a driver. Tesla went through Arizona’s self-certification process in September to test autonomous vehicles, an ADOT spokesperson confirmed.

At an Axios event on Tuesday, the entrepreneur behind the popular AI platform and community site agreed that bubble talk is today’s “trillion-dollar question,” but said he doesn’t believe AI’s future is at risk if the bubble bursts. Instead, as Delangue sees it, it’s large language models (LLMs) — like those powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and other chatbots — that are receiving outsized attention, and that attention may not last. “I think we’re in an LLM bubble, and I think the LLM bubble might be bursting next year,” explained Delangue. “But ‘LLM’ is just a subset of AI when it comes to applying AI to biology, chemistry, image, audio, [and] video. I think we’re at the beginning of it, and we’ll see much more in the next few years,” he noted. One issue, he argued, is that LLMs aren’t the right solution for everything, and smaller, more specialized models will see increased adoption in the future. “I think all the attention, all the focus, all the money, is concentrated into this idea that you can build one model through a bunch of compute and that is going to solve all problems for all companies and all people,” said Delangue. “I think the reality is that you’ll see in the next few months, next few years, kind of like a multiplicity of models that are more customized, specialized, that are going to solve different problems.” As an example, he suggested the use case of a banking customer chatbot. “You don’t need it to tell you about the meaning of life, right? You can use a smaller, more specialized model that is going to be cheaper, that is going to be faster, that maybe you’re going to be able to run on your infrastructure as an enterprise, and I think that is the future of AI,” Delangue pointed out.

TWG holds a variety of the billionaires’ assets, including Walter’s stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers and the new Cadillac F1 racing team. The firm also has a $15 billion fund to invest in AI anchored by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Capital. TWG previously invested in a partnership with Elon Musk’s xAI and Palantir to sell AI agents to enterprises. Now it’s backing Lambda, which operates a number of U.S. AI data centers. Lambda is a CoreWeave competitor, although it also sells its “AI factories” to hyperscaler clouds. Earlier this month, Lambda announced a multibillion-dollar deal to supply Microsoft with AI infrastructure using tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs. (Nvidia is an investor in Lambda as well .) Remember that Microsoft had a similar deal with CoreWeave and had bought about $1 billion worth of services from the company in 2024, its largest customer last year by a mile. Then OpenAI swooped in and signed a $12 billion deal with CoreWeave in March. Meanwhile, deal watchers have been talking for months about Lambda looking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a valuation north of $4 billion . There was also talk of an IPO . Prior to this, Lambda raised a $480 million Series D in February, with an estimated valuation of $2.5 billion, according to PitchBook. Lambda’s $1.5 billion raise far outstrips those earlier whispers of what it was seeking. Whether its valuation also soared, we can’t confirm and Lambda declined to comment on that.

The FTC did manage to surface evidence showing that Meta — then called Facebook — was concerned about Instagram’s fast growth and the competition it could pose. “One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying is time,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote in February 2012, per internal Facebook emails that surfaced during the trial. “Even if some new competitors springs [sic] up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare, etc. now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again.” But Judge Boasberg was not ruling on whether Meta had acted as a monopoly back then, but rather, if it is currently a monopoly. Boasberg pointed to apps like TikTok as evidence that Meta has competition. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly,” Boasberg wrote in his memorandum opinion. “While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.”  Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

Burks Tractor, a dealership located in Idaho, has sued Monarch for breach of contract and allegedly violating its warranty because the California-based startup’s tractors were “unable to operate autonomously.” The dealership also says the 10 tractors it purchased “continue to experience significant problems,” and calls them “defective.” Monarch Tractor CEO Praveen Penmetsa and a lawyer for the company did not respond to a request for comment. Monarch has denied the allegations in a court filing . The previously unreported lawsuit, which was filed in September in Idaho state court and has since moved to federal court, is the latest trouble for Monarch. The company has spent a few years trying to get its tractors — which are electric and supposed to be autonomous, or as Monarch calls it, “driver optional” — to catch on at wineries and dairy farms. But it’s gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the last two years . The Ohio factory where its tractors were being built by Foxconn is now being renovated into an AI data center , and Monarch has been trying to pivot to software and tech licensing. Burks Tractor says in its complaint that it purchased the 10 tractors from Monarch in early 2024 with the intent of being one of the California startup’s first dealers. During those negotiations, Burks Tractor claims Monarch “expressly represented” the tractors would be fully autonomous, and the autonomy features “were not limited by location or time.” Monarch even provided demo videos to Burks Tractor that showed the equipment performing autonomous tasks, according to the complaint. Burks Tractor paid Monarch $773,088 for the tractors and financed the purchase, according to the lawsuit, meaning it is still paying interest. The dealer also purchased spare parts.

The company announced on Monday that users worldwide will be able to start group chats with up to 200 other people, then collaborate across more than 200 AI models — including text, image, video, and audio generators — within a single conversation. The launch comes just days after OpenAI’s ChatGPT began piloting group chats in markets like Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. The move could potentially transform the chatbot from a one-on-one AI interaction into a collaborative space where users can also engage with friends, family, or colleagues. Quora says the addition of group chats to Poe could enable new types of interactive experiences for AI users. For instance, the company suggests that families or friends could use the feature to plan a trip together using Gemini 2.5’s search functionality and o3 Deep Research. Teams could also work together to brainstorm images for mood boards using the various image models on Poe, or groups could play trivia games together using one of the quiz bots on the app. The group chats will allow users to work together using any combination of AI models or creator-made bots, including models like Claude 4.5 Sonnet, ElevenLabs v3, ElevenLabs Music, Nano Banana, GPT-5.1, Kling 2.5 Turbo Pro, o3 Deep Research, Sora 2 Pro, and Veo 3.1, among others. Poe users can start a group chat from the app’s home screen on the website at poe.com. As you chat, the chat history will sync in real time across your devices, so you could start chatting on desktop and then move to a mobile device without losing the thread.

The “LPs” who fund VCs are confronting an asset class in flux: Funds have nearly twice the lifespan they used to, emerging managers face life-or-death fundraising challenges, and billions of dollars sit trapped in startups that may never justify their 2021 valuations. Indeed, at a recent StrictlyVC panel in San Francisco, above the din of the boisterous crowd gathered to watch it, five prominent LPs, representing endowments, fund-of-funds, and secondaries firms managing over $100 billion combined, painted a surprising picture of venture capital’s current state, even as they see areas of opportunity emerging from the upheaval. Perhaps the most striking revelation was that venture funds are living far longer than anyone planned for, creating a raft of problems for institutional investors. “Conventional wisdom may have suggested 13-year-old funds,” said Adam Grosher, a director at the J. Paul Getty Trust, which manages $9.5 billion. “In our own portfolio, we have funds that are 15, 18, even 20 years old that still hold marquee assets, blue-chip assets that we would be happy to hold.” Still, the “asset class is just a lot more illiquid” than most might imagine based on the history of the industry, he said. This extended timeline is forcing LPs to rip up and rebuild their allocation models. Lara Banks of Makena Capital, which manages $6 billion in private equity and venture capital, noted her firm now models an 18-year fund life, with the majority of capital actually returning in years 16 through 18. Meanwhile, the J. Paul Getty Trust is actively revisiting how much capital to deploy, leaning toward more conservative allocations to avoid overexposure. The alternative is active portfolio management through secondaries, a market that has become essential infrastructure. “I think every LP and every GP should be actively engaging with the secondary market,” said Matt Hodan of Lexington Pa", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/our-funds-are-20-years-old-a-look-inside-the-liquidity-crisis-reshaping-venture-capital/", "timestamp": 1763533435.3117726}

Priced at ₹109, the company’s shares climbed as high as ₹161.99 before closing at ₹156.49, valuing it at ₹448 billion (around $5 billion). That’s well above its listing valuation of ₹315 billion (approximately $3.6 billion), and roughly 79% higher than its last private valuation of $2.8 billion in September 2024. Physics Wallah raised ₹34.8 billion (around $393 million) in the IPO. Of this, ₹31 billion (approximately $350.1 million) was through a fresh issue of shares, while ₹3.8 billion (roughly $42.9 million) worth of shares were sold by co-founders Alakh Pandey and Prateek Boob, who together held about 80% of the company before the listing. The strong IPO highlights the company’s remarkable growth arc since its humble beginnings as a YouTube channel run by Pandey in 2016. It now stands out in an industry otherwise reeling from layoffs, a funding drought, and the unraveling of once-high-flying rival Byju’s. Today, the company offers test-preparation and upskilling courses via its website, apps, and offline centers. The company’s rise comes as its larger rivals struggle to operate. Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup at $22 billion , was engulfed in a corporate-governance crisis, has been fighting legal battles with lenders , and is dealing with a severe cash crunch that has forced mass layoffs . The Bengaluru-based startup is currently undergoing insolvency proceedings in both India and the U.S. Unacademy, another high-profile edtech, has also sharply scaled back operations and cut staff , and is reported to be in talks to be acquired by upskilling platform UpGrad for $300 to $400 million — a steep decline from its $3.44 billion valuation in 2021.

Cloudflare said in its status page at around 8 a.m. ET it had identified the issues and was implementing a fix. Less than two hours later, Cloudflare said “a fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal.” Around the same time, Cloudflare’s chief technology officer Dane Knecht explained that a latent bug was responsible in an apologetic X post . “In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack,” Knecht wrote, referring to a bug that went undetected in testing and has not caused a failure. Knecht also said Cloudflare failed its customers and “the broader internet” with the outage, and promised that the company is already working to make sure “it does not happen again.” “I know it caused real pain today,” Knecht added, promising a more in-depth breakdown of what happened “in a few hours.” The company has since noted on its status page that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. Cloudflare said it’s working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues. Cloudflare’s massive outage came less than a month after a similar outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), and is another stark reminder that the entire web depends on just a handful of companies. If these giants experience an issue, the whole of the internet start to crumble. According to an estimate , Cloudflare is used by 20% of all websites on the internet.

The world, and especially Hallmark movies, is full of holiday disaster stories: burnt turkeys, failed desserts, steamed hams . But I'm not bragging when I say that the first Thanksgiving dinner I prepared for my extended family—a little early, this year—was an unmitigated success. My aunt couldn't stop talking about the black pepper in the biscuits and the sage on the carrots. My uncle went in for the turkey and the apple-sausage stuffing. My father didn't speak at all, unless prompted. He just ate and ate. This was a compliment. But of course, I had cheated. I had ordered my Thanksgiving in the mail—one of the new breed of Thanksgiving meal kits. The meal was genuinely home-cooked, of course, prepared mostly from scratch. But the entire seven-platter feast—its ingredients and recipes—had arrived two days before, in a box large enough to house a primal cut of beef. It was Thanksgiving in a box: a $200 “Chef's Table Thanksgiving” meal kit available from sister meal delivery plans Sunbasket and Gobble . The spread from Sunbasket was vast and generous. The table contained a nearly 3-pound roast of turkey, mounds of mashed potato, pebbled cranberry compote, roasted carrots dressed in miso-sage butter, brussels sprouts dappled with pecorino romano and pancetta, an endless platter of fennel-apple-sausage-stuffing, Gruyère black-pepper biscuits caked more than an inch tall, a tureen of deep brown turkey gravy, a ginger apple crisp waiting in the wings. Sunbasket is among a new bounty of meal kit companies that aim to ease the stress of the holidays by doing the planning and the shopping for you—big meal boxes tailor-made for those who still want to make a home-cooked meal but for whom the prospect of planning a vast and complicated feast is prohibitive.

That's quite the deal on a product that doesn't often see major discounts, and you can use that gift card to accessorize your new headset. Meta Best Buy (Walking Dead Bundle) Amazon Walmart Meta Meta's lineup of stand-alone headsets has slowly improved over the last few years, with frequent updates adding functionality and growing the library of games. You don't need a computer or console to power them, which makes it easy to just toss the headset on and start playing without any extra steps. With object and hand tracking, sometimes you don't even need controllers, and the pass-through camera lets you blend the real world and the virtual one for awesome mixed reality experiences. While the Quest 3S is the more budget-friendly offering in the current generation of headsets, the compromises aren't as major as you might be thinking. The screen is slightly lower resolution, and the pass-through isn't quite as sharp, but otherwise the Quest 3S plays the same games and experiences as the more expensive Quest 3 . Both headsets suffer from limited battery life, so don't expect more than a couple of hours of play at a time. I haven't had a chance to play the included game, Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners, but it's described as a survival action game set in a zombie-ridden version of New Orleans. You'll have to make tough decisions about how to deal with other survivors, and it looks like there are plenty of opportunities to slay zombies.

Heavy sleepers know how easy it is to snooze through the overly genteel alarms on your phone. For people who can’t get out of bed without a bigger jolt, extreme alarms have popped up in recent years—from relatively simple puzzle-alarm phone apps to alarms on wheels to alarms that shake the bed. Not only are these an innovative way to get chronic snoozers out of bed, but they can be great for those who are hard of hearing, utilizing different frequencies and pitches as well as movement through vibration. I’m a very heavy sleeper, so I tried one of these nontraditional extreme alarm clocks every day for a full week (at least). I chose the extreme alarms that were the most rated or reviewed online, found most often on online retailers like Amazon and in the app store, and tried to get a versatile range of options that focused on different areas, whether it be sound or activity. While I can say that they worked better at getting me out and helping me stay out of bed, most mornings I woke up with anxiety like I was being hunted for sport.

As talk of an AI bubble grows, the company is keen to stress that its latest release is more than just a clever model and chatbot—it’s a way of improving Google’s existing products, including its lucrative search business, starting today. “We are the engine room of Google, and we're plugging in AI everywhere now,” Demis Hassabis , CEO of Google DeepMind, an AI-focused subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told WIRED in an interview ahead of the announcement. Hassabis admits that the AI market appears inflated, with a number of unproven startups receiving multibillion-dollar valuations. Google and other AI firms are also investing billions in building out new data centers to train and run AI models, sparking fears of a potential crash. But even if the AI bubble bursts, Hassabis thinks Google is insulated. The company is already using AI to enhance products like Google Maps, Gmail, and Search. “In the downside scenario, we will lean more on that,” Hassabis says. “In the upside scenario, I think we've got the broadest portfolio and the most pioneering research.” Google is also using AI to build popular new tools like NotebookLM , which can auto-generate podcasts from written materials, and AI Studio which can prototype applications with AI. It’s even exploring embedding the technology into areas like gaming and robotics, which Hassabis says could pay huge dividends in years to come, regardless of what happens in the wider market. Google is making Gemini 3 available today through the Gemini app and in AI Overviews , a Google Search feature that synthesizes information alongside regular search results.

Agent 365 is not a platform for making enterprise AI tools; it’s a way to manage them, as if they were human employees . Companies using generative AI agents in their digital workplace can use Agent 365 to organize their growing sprawl of bots, keep tabs on how they’re performing, and tweak their settings. The tool is rolling out today in Microsoft’s early access program. Essentially, Microsoft created a trackable workspace for agents . “Tools that you use to manage people, devices, and applications today, you'd want to extend them to run agents as well in the future,” says Charles Lamanna, a president of business and industry for Microsoft’s Copilot , its AI chatbot. Lamanna envisions a future where companies have many more agents performing labor than humans. For example, if a company has 100,000 employees, he sees them as using “half a million to a million agents,” ranging in tasks from simple email organization to running the “whole procurement process” for a business. He claims Microsoft internally uses millions of agents. This army of bots, with permission to take actions inside a company’s software and automate aspects of an employee’s workflow, could quickly grow unwieldy to track. A lack of clear oversight could also open businesses up to security breaches . Agent 365 is a way to manage all your bots, whether those agents were built with Microsoft’s tools or through a third-party platform. Agent 365’s core feature is a registry of an organization’s active agents all in one place, featuring specific identification numbers for each and details about how they are being used by employees. It’s also where you can change the settings for agents and what aspects of a business’s software each one has permission to access. The tool includes security measures to scan what every agent is doing in real time. “As data flows between people, agent", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-ai-agent-365/", "timestamp": 1763533437.3428512}

Binoculars are usually listed with two number specifications; for example, our top pick, the Nikon Monarch M5 are 8x42 binoculars. Here's what that means: The number 8 refers to the magnification power . Objects seen through these binoculars will be eight times bigger than when you look with your naked eye. Newcomers should stick with 6X or 8X. They have enough power that you'll see things clearly, but they don't magnify so much that you'll struggle to find what you want to see or have trouble following fast-moving objects (though all binoculars take some practice). The 42 refers to the size of the front lens in millimeters . The larger the front lens (also called the objective lens), the more light reaches your eye. That means the image will be bigger, brighter, and clearer. A pair of 8x42 binoculars should be significantly brighter and offer a better viewing experience than a pair of 8x32 binoculars, even though both provide the same magnification. But the larger you get, the more glass they will use—so they'll weigh more. The weight difference between an 8x32 pair and a 10x42 pair is significant if you're wearing them all day.

Repeat that same trick a few billion times with every possible phone number, it turns out, and the same feature can also serve as a convenient way to obtain the cell number of virtually every WhatsApp user on earth—along with, in many cases, profile photos and text that identifies each of those users. The result is a sprawling exposure of personal information for a significant fraction of the world population. One group of Austrian researchers have now shown that they were able to use that simple method of checking every possible number in WhatsApp's contact discovery to extract 3.5 billion users’ phone numbers from the messaging service. For about 57 percent of those users, they also found that they could access their profile photos, and for another 29 percent, the text on their profiles. Despite a previous warning about WhatsApp's exposure of this data from a different researcher in 2017, they say, the service's parent company, Meta, still failed to limit the speed or number of contact discovery requests the researchers could make by interacting with WhatsApp's browser-based app, allowing them to check roughly a hundred million numbers an hour. The result would be “the largest data leak in history, had it not been collated as part of a responsibly conducted research study,” as the researchers describe it in a paper documenting their findings . “To the best of our knowledge, this marks the most extensive exposure of phone numbers and related user data ever documented,” says Aljosha Judmayer, one of the researchers at the University of Vienna who worked on the study.

Now it’s official.", "content": "Last week, the Social Security Administration (SSA) quietly updated a public notice to reveal that the agency would be sharing “citizenship and immigration information” with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This data sharing was already happening: WIRED reported in April that the Trump administration had already started pooling sensitive data from across the government for the purpose of immigration enforcement. This public notice issued by SSA makes that official, months after the fact. The notice is known as a system of record notice (SORN), a document that outlines how an agency will share the data it has, with whom, and for what purpose. This notice is required under the Privacy Act of 1974. Normally, SORNs are issued before any data is shared between agencies, giving the public and government officials sufficient time to offer comment.

But who cares if it looks like a probe from a sci-fi flick—does it do the job? First up: the vibrating dildo. It’s here you’ll find five extremely powerful vibration intensities packed into the textured shaft, ideal for G-spot or P-spot stimulation. Because this part of the toy also doubles as an ergonomic handle, it has some weight to it and is more girthy than many internal vibrators. That allows the G-spot stimulator to cover more area, making those rumbles feel more intense than they normally would. I typically like stronger vibrations, but I didn’t feel the need to turn things up past the third level on the Lick to find the sweet spot. Le Wand Lick 3-in-1 Rechargeable Double-Ended Vibrator Rating: 8/10 When you flip the Lick around, things look more complicated—especially if you’re new to suction play—but if you take your time to understand these features, you’ll be a happy camper. On this end, you have a suction cup and a tongue-shaped clitoral stimulator. Remove the cup—just a quick twist and it’s off—you can easily access the flicking tongue. The tongue has three speeds that, with a bit of water-based lube , are meant to mimic the sensation of oral sex. It didn’t feel much like oral sex to me, which probably says more about my partners than the Lick, but it felt great against my clitoris. So much so that this was my favorite function of the Lick. However, I want to stress the importance of lube .

Or some kind of sunny apocalypse fable. Perhaps a commentary on AI-curated sameness. It’s sci-fi, yes, but also a deeply thought-out character drama. But honestly, the less you know going in, the better. Everyone has different takes on what the latest show from Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan means , but that’s also kind of the point. What viewers take away from it depends on the baggage they bring to it. Ultimately, though, it questions what would happen if the entire world did suddenly live in harmony. That, dear reader, is the kind of question that keeps us up at night. Every streaming service needs a flashy mainstream drama with Hollywood heavyweights to pull in viewers. Apple TV has The Morning Show . When Alex Levy (Jennifer Aniston) loses her morning news program cohost Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell) following sexual misconduct accusations, she gets paired up with Bradley Jackson (Reese Witherspoon) to revamp the show. What unfolds is a #MeToo-era drama full of TV network intrigue and Sorkin-lite dialog.

The El Segundo, California-based startup , which last week announced it had secured a $130 million funding round with backing from Palmer Luckey and Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar, claims that it is the first nuclear startup to create a critical fission reaction. It’s also, more specifically, the first company in a special Department of Energy pilot program aiming to get at least three startups to criticality by July 4 of next year to announce it had achieved this reaction. The pilot program, which was formed following an executive order President Donald Trump signed in May, has upended US regulation of nuclear startups, allowing companies to reach new milestones like criticality at a rapid pace. “Zero power criticality is a reactor’s first heartbeat, proof the physics holds,” Valar founder Isaiah Taylor said in a statement. “This moment marks the dawn of a new era in American nuclear engineering, one defined by speed, scale, and private-sector execution with closer federal partnership.” Criticality is the term used for when a nuclear reactor is sustaining a chain reaction—the first step in providing power. Enriched nuclear fuel releases neutrons, which hit other atoms, which then split apart; neutrons from that process then hit other atoms, and start the reaction over. This process is known as fission. A properly functioning reactor has just enough reactions to keep that fission chain going, reaching a state of criticality. “Think of a long chain of dominoes,” says Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation program at the Breakthrough Institute, an eco-modernist policy center. “If you have those dominoes spaced out too far, a domino won't hit the next one.

I should know—I've been straightening my 3a curly hair since the George H.W. Bush administration, and over the past year I've tried just about every style and brand of flat iron or straightening implement. Needless to say, I've learned a few things. First off, hair straighteners are somewhat subjective. People have different hair, and types of hair, and ideas of what they'd like their hair to look like. A high-heat titanium iron might be a godsend for someone with 4b coily hair, but could destroy another person's fine, 2a wavy hair.

It's proven for longevity (former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has had hers since college), it's got ceramic plates that are safe even for fine hair and beginners, and the wide plates have enough power for hard-to-straighten hair but aren't so wide they inhibit maneuverability.

Commander Chen Dong, concluding his third trip to space, and rookie crewmates Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie touched down inside their spacecraft at the Dongfeng landing zone at 1:29 am EST (06:29 UTC) Friday. The parachute-assisted landing occurred in the mid-afternoon at the return zone, located in the remote Gobi Desert of northwestern China. Chinese space officials upended operations on the country’s Tiangong space lab last week after astronauts found damage to one of two Shenzhou return capsules docked at the station. The China Manned Space Agency, run by the country’s military, announced changes to the space station’s flight plan November 4, the day before three crew members were supposed to depart and fly home. Chen and his crewmates were preparing to board the Shenzhou 20 spacecraft for the ride back to Earth a few days after the arrival of three replacement crew members on the newly launched Shenzhou 21 capsule. Shenzhou 20 is the same spacecraft that launched Chen’s crew in April. But a little more than a week ago, Chinese officials said the Shenzhou 20 spacecraft was “suspected of being impacted by small space debris” and confirmed the return trip would be postponed. Officials provided no additional details. China’s human spaceflight agency released a cryptic statement earlier this week saying preparations were underway for the crew’s undocking and landing, but the circumstances of the return remained opaque until hours before the astronauts’ homecoming. Finally, officials confirmed the details of the return to Earth late Thursday. “Based on preliminary analysis of photographs, design review, simulation analysis, and wind tunnel tests, a comprehensive assessment determined that the Shenzhou 20 manned spacecraft’s return capsule window glass had developed a minor cra", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/three-astronauts-are-stuck-on-chinas-space-station-without-a-safe-ride-home/", "timestamp": 1763533441.4170063}

Witt explains how the company spun GPU (graphics processing unit) manufacturing for gaming into parallel processing and a marriage of hardware and software that has powered the rise of AI. It has also made Huang very rich, but he isn’t always painted in a flattering light, which helps to counterbalance the founder worship vibe.

You’ve got about two to three years, give or take, before your beloved bed sheets and feather pillows are going to give up the ghost and need replacing . Electronics are also complicated to dispose of, given that batteries can’t be thrown in the trash , yet you want to free up some storage space. When their time is up, you must—in the most literal sense—lay them to rest. I take the mantra of “reuse, reduce, and recycle” very seriously, and will eke out as much extra mileage as I can by cutting up old sheets and towels to use as cleaning rags, or turning a ratty old pillow into a makeshift dog bed. Recycling programs near me don’t accept textiles, so eventually I have to toss them into the trash, knowing they're headed to a landfill. The numbers on textile waste are astounding. In 2017, the UN Environment Programme reported that 92 million metric tons of textile waste were generated globally each year, with the US accounting for 17 million metric tons, according to another 2017 statistic by the Environmental Protection Agency . It feels pretty bleak. However, thanks to a targeted social media ad, I found a textile-recycling subscription service that's the answer I’ve been looking for: Trashie . Purchase a “Take Back Bag” for $20 and you can send in clean, used clothing, bedsheets, shoes, and even old Halloween costumes. The bags come in packs of one or three. There is also the “Take Back Tech Box” for $25, where you can send back old electronics that have been collecting dust in a drawer.

Faceless, shrouded in black with red eyes and a top hat, it ominously lurks in the corner. The Benadryl Hat Man is a shared and recurring hallucination that people report witnessing when taking dozens of the antihistamine at a time. The figure, depicted in Halloween costumes , POV-Benadryl trip memes , and Walmart graphic tees , has become the symbol for a new drug trend that sees young people deliberately taking large doses of the drug, not to ward off allergies, but to get high. John, a 21-year-old college student who used to trip on Benadryl, never saw the Hat Man. Yet, he says, “I could see how that could happen. It's [Benadryl] digging in the depths of your brain to find whatever's making you scared. So, if you're scared of the Hat Man, I'm sure you're going to see the Hat Man.” This searching for the unpleasant to reveal itself, while sounding horrible, is, in fact, the purpose of recreational Benadryl use. (John does not want his real name used due to fear of friends finding out.) When used in high doses, diphenhydramine, an ingredient in Benadryl, functions as a deliriant, a hallucinogenic class of drugs, which appear to be becoming increasingly popular among young people for nonmedical purposes. Unlike psychedelics or other hallucinogens, there’s no real potential for a good trip on a deliriant. According to the people I spoke to, every trip is bad, every trip is brutal, and that’s the point. In 2020, the “Benadryl challenge ” gained traction on TikTok, daring participants to take doses of at least 12 Benadryl pills for an intense trip. The trend, which resurfaces every few years, drew attention to the psychoactive effects of deliriants. “I saw a video about it on TikTok once, so I knew it could be used recreationally,” one user tells me.

I remember vividly my mom using baby powder in the 1980s, as well as my first purchase of drugstore dry shampoo in the early 2000s. It went on like spray paint and probably contained enough chemicals to poison a small animal, but it did the job of letting me skip a couple days of my arduous wash, dry, and straighten routine . This break was good for my sanity as well as my hair. Come 2022, commercially produced dry shampoo received its first major black eye when companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever conducted a voluntary recall of their dry shampoos for potentially elevated levels of benzene . Familiar drugstore brands like Dove, Nexxus, and Suave were suddenly seen as being a cancer risk, which raised the question with dry shampoos in general: What is actually in this stuff? Thankfully, since the recall most companies have taken to testing their products for benzene and other harmful chemicals. Third-party testing is hard to come by, but the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG) is independently funded and has a Skin Deep database tool for consumers to parse what harmful ingredients might be lurking in their cosmetics and personal care products.

There’s Sam Altman, chief executive of the whole company, who manages research and compute. And as of this summer, there’s Fidji Simo, the former CEO of Instacart, who manages everything else. Simo hasn’t been seen much at OpenAI’s San Francisco office since she began as CEO of Applications in August. But her presence is felt at every level of the company—not least because she’s heading up ChatGPT and basically every function that might make OpenAI money. Simo is dealing with a relapse of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) that makes her prone to fainting if she stands for long periods of time. So for now, she’s working from home in Los Angeles, and she’s on Slack. A lot. “Being present from 8 am to midnight every day, responding within five minutes, people feel like I’m there and that they can reach me immediately, that I jump on the phone within five minutes,” she tells me. Employees confirm that this is true. OpenAI’s famously Slack-driven culture can be overwhelming for new hires. But not, apparently, for Simo. Employees say she is often seen popping into channels and threads, sharing thoughts and asking questions. Simo joined during a chaotic period for OpenAI, which is expanding in nearly every direction. There are sovereign AI partnerships, new model releases, retail partnerships, multibillion-dollar compute deals , a proprietary chip, a mysterious hardware product—and of course, ChatGPT. “We do not battle for scope,” Simo says. “We battle for less scope.” Outside Silicon Valley, Simo’s hiring came as a surprise. For those in the know, it was less of a shock.

As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person. When Halliburton arrived at the Rosewood Hotel, he found Even and Maxim perched in a booth. They struck him as playboy, high-roller types—particularly Maxim, who wore a tan three-piece suit and had a highly manicured look, his long dark hair parted down the middle. A Rolex protruded from the cuff of his sleeve. Over a three-course lunch—ceviche with a roe garnish, Chilean sea bass, and cherry cake—they discussed the contours of the deal and traded details about their respective backgrounds. Even was talkative and jocular, telling stories about blowout parties in Marrakech. Maxim was aloof; he mostly stared at Halliburton, holding his gaze for long periods at a time as though sizing him up. As a relationship-building exercise, Even proposed that Halliburton sell the family office around $3,000 in bitcoin. Halliburton was initially hesitant, but chalked it up as a peculiar dating ritual.

My wife—who has endured more soundbar unboxings than any audio civilian should have to—was immediately impressed by its striking design.

Subscription boxes for kids can be useful educational supplements for homeschool or remote learning . Most are consumable, so your kid can have a treat that won't be left to molder in a corner of a playroom until they're 25. They're also handy to have around the house if you can’t send your sniffly kid to school or a big indoor birthday party. As a bonus, they’re usually affordable. I tested some of the subscriptions on this list, like the Lovevery Reading Skill Set 3-box set ($160) , and I bought others for my kids and their friends. These are our favorites. Be sure to check out our other buying guides for kids, including the Best Strollers , the Best Kids Bikes , and the Best STEM Toys . Updated November 2025: We refreshed information on all the crates, added new pictures, and added the Lovevery reading skill set box, CrunchLabs Creative Kits, Bookroo, and Enlightened Generation. We also updated links and prices. KiwiCo KiwiCo We subscribed to Kiwi Crate's monthly subscription for so long that the company sent us a cautious email asking whether it was OK that we were getting repeat boxes. I now check in every year to discover that yes, the company's boxes are still amazing. Each box comes with a single, delightful, themed activity that's appropriate for a kid aged anywhere from a few months old to 18 years. A recent Delivery Bot ($24) aimed for 9+ years entertained my 8-year-old son for an afternoon. I can't extoll the virtues of this crate enough. The instructions are clear enough for young kids to follow.

It ranks on just about every list of the best VPNs (including our own), and it’s obvious to anyone with an internet connection and vague interest in tech just how aggressive NordVPN’s marketing strategy is. It has a high bar to live up to, and thankfully, it does. Even in the face of a public hack and PR disaster in 2019, not to mention the massive target on its back given how prominent NordVPN is, the core service is still excellent. The speeds can go toe-to-toe with the best VPNs on the market, and Nord’s privacy and security practices have been tested and proven effective, even against the company’s will. Further, it has largely led the market on large feature packages alongside its VPN service, which we’ve seen mimicked by competitors like ExpressVPN. NordVPN still stands tall today, and despite being a little more expensive than I’d like, it feels worth the price. NordVPN has slowly built up multiple plans at varying prices, each unlocking a new set of features. It doesn’t offer a free plan, which is a shame in the face of options like Proton VPN and Nord’s own free NordPass password manager. You’ll need to pay to get your foot in the door. NordVPN Plus Rating: 8/10 NordVPN’s Basic plan is on the expensive side, and as the name suggests, it doesn’t come with many extras. You get the VPN, 10 simultaneous connections, and Nord’s DNS servers to help combat ads. However, you don’t get Threat Protection Pro, which includes more sophisticated ad blocking, as well as malware/scam protection in your browser. For that, you’ll need to upgrade to the Plus plan, which not only includes Threat Protection Pro but also the paid version of NordPass, which is a big upgrade. NordVPN’s Basic plan is more expensive than Mullvad and Windscribe, but the Plus plan is more in line with the rest of the market.

It’s another example of how genes exploit mechanical forces for growth and development.", "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine . Sip a glass of wine, and you will notice liquid continuously weeping down the wetted side of the glass. In 1855, James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin, explained in the Philosophical Magazine that these wine “tears” or “legs” result from the difference in surface tension between alcohol and water. “This fact affords an explanation of several very curious motions,” Thomson wrote. Little did he realize that the same effect, later named the Marangoni effect, might also shape how embryos develop. In March, a group of biophysicists in France reported that the Marangoni effect is responsible for the pivotal moment when a homogeneous blob of cells elongates and develops a head-and-tail axis — the first defining features of the organism it will become. The finding is part of a trend that defies the norm in biology. Typically, biologists try to characterize growth, development, and other biological processes as the result of chemical cues triggered by genetic instructions. But that picture has often seemed incomplete. Researchers now increasingly appreciate the role of mechanical forces in biology: forces that push and pull tissues in response to their material properties, steering growth and development in ways that genes cannot. Modern imaging and measurement techniques have opened scientists’ eyes to these forces by flooding the field with data that invites mechanical interpretations. “What has changed over the past decades is really the possibility to watch what happens live, and to see the mechanics in terms of cell movement, cell rearrangement, tissue growth,” said Pierre-François Lenne of Aix Marseille University, one of the researchers behind the recent study. The shift toward mechanical explanations has revived interest in pre-genetic models of biology. For example, in 1917 the Scottish biologist, mathematician, and classics scholar D’Arcy Thompson published On Growth and Form , which highlighted simil", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-genes-have-harnessed-physics-to-grow-living-things/", "timestamp": 1763533443.6524787}

One of the latest updates to Google Gemini gives you the ability to set up scheduled actions. These are exactly what they sound like: tasks that you can get Google Gemini to run automatically, on a schedule. Maybe you want a weather and news report every morning at 7 am, or perhaps you want an evening meal suggestion every evening at 7 pm. Anything you can already get Gemini to do, you can schedule. It brings Gemini up to speed in this regard with the ChatGPT app, which introduced scheduled tasks several months ago. The idea here is more or less the same: The bot can carry out your commands at a specific point in the future, and keep repeating them if you need to. Here's how the feature works on both platforms. At the time of writing, this requires a subscription to Google's AI service , which starts at $20 a month for Google AI Pro. The chatbot can keep track of up to 10 scheduled actions at once, so you need to be quite selective about how you use it. You can use scheduled actions in Gemini on the web , and in the mobile apps for Android and iOS . All you need to do to create a scheduled action in Gemini is to describe it, and include the scheduling details in the prompt. For example, you might tell Gemini to “generate an image of a cat playing with a ball of yarn, every Monday at 12 pm,” or “give me a general-knowledge trivia question every evening at 7 pm.” Scheduled actions can be set to happen once—like next Friday at 3 pm, so something happens on a specific day at a specific time. Alternatively, your actions can run on a recurring daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They can't be set on a more complicated cadence (such as every second Tuesday in the month), or surprise you at random.

The user, posting under the handle DustyJames3 on the subreddit r/antiwork, wrote that they were let go in a sudden meeting where company leaders cited vague concerns about “fit” and “timelines.” When the employee asked for specific examples or performance issues, they allegedly received none. According to the post, the firing came as a shock because the user believed they were performing well. They had recently completed a major project that reportedly led to a client renewal and even public praise from company leadership. “So this was… jarring, to say the least,” the user wrote. What followed, however, left the employee even more confused. Within hours of being terminated, the company allegedly began sending multiple emails and missed calls regarding the “dimensions of the equipment” the employee needed to return. Instead of a simple request to ship it back, the user described the messages — including several from HR and one from the company owner — as persistent and urgent. The post notes that the employee had already marked upcoming paid time off on their work calendar and was travelling in a remote desert location with no phone service when the calls began. “I’m sitting here still trying to process getting fired, and they’re acting like I’m holding their equipment hostage,” the user wrote. Despite planning to return all company property “promptly and professionally,” the user said the timing and tone of the messages felt “insensitive and tone deaf.” They questioned whether the company was attempting to intimidate them, cover itself legally, or simply mishandling the termination process. “Part of me irrationally wants to believe the owner is reaching out because someone realized the firing was rushed or handled poorly,” they", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/fired-out-of-nowhere-employee-says-company-began-calling-nonstop-for-equipment-return-reddit-post-goes-viral-11763532696812.html", "timestamp": 1763533477.8554952}

In an interview with ANI, Joy expressed profound gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for granting her asylum in August 2024, and claimed that militants were planning to assassinate her. “They terminated 17 judges before the trial, amended laws illegally without parliamentary approval, and barred her defence attorneys from court proceedings,” he told ANI. “When there is no due process whatsoever, no country is going to extradite.” He expressed confidence that Indian authorities would reject the request, citing the absence of proper legal procedures in Dhaka. Hasina faces multiple charges in Bangladesh related to her 15-year tenure, but Joy insists the judicial process has been fundamentally compromised by the interim government. Explaining the circumstances of his mother's dramatic departure, he credited India with saving her life. “India has essentially saved my mother's life. If she hadn't left Bangladesh, the militants had planned on killing her.” Whilst acknowledging his government's “mishandling” of the initial protests in July 2024, Joy characterised the subsequent events as an orchestrated “political coup” rather than a spontaneous popular uprising. In claims likely to resonate with security establishments in New Delhi, Joy alleged that the interim Yunus government has released “tens of thousands of terrorists” previously convicted under Sheikh Hasina's administration. He claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba is now operating freely in Bangladesh, alleging links between its local branch and recent terror attacks in Delhi. “I think Prime Minister Modi is probably very, very concerned about terrorism from Bangladesh,” he said, directly connecting the political upheaval in Dhaka to India's security concerns.

Here's all you need to know about the day.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "World Toilet Day is observed on 19 November every year to raise awareness about the global sanitation crisis and the importance of safe, accessible toilets for everyone worldwide. This dedicated day highlights the crucial role toilets play in public health , dignity and environmental protection. It also sheds light on the needs of thousands of people who still lack access to safe sanitation. Here's a look at the history and significance of the day. The day gains its significance from a Singaporean philanthropist, Jack Sim, who founded the NGOWorld Toilet Organisation (WTO) on 19 November to raise awareness about global sanitation challenges. In 2010, the United Nations (UN) declared the right to water and sanitation a human right; that's when the idea of World Toilet Day started gaining popularity. Finally, on 14 July 2013, the UN officially declared 19 November as World Toilet Day. The theme of World Toilet Day 2025 is ‘Sanitation in a changing world,’ which highlights the urgent need to invest in sanitation systems and services that are ‘future-ready,’ as per UN Water. World Toilet Day serves as a crucial reminder for all stakeholders to work towards ensuring universal access to safe, affordable, and reliable sanitation systems, supported by sustained investment. The 2025 World Toilet Day campaign demands that toilets are accessible to everyone and resilient to flooding, droughts, and other climate-related shocks.

Naresh, who recently returned with his wife as they approach retirement, wrote on X that several of their friends in the US are also weighing the idea of relocating to India for their later years. Many of them, he said, are financially comfortable and eager to reconnect with their roots — yet unsure about what day-to-day life in India would look like after decades abroad. Although he noted that “there are so many positives” to settling in India, Naresh pointed out that one particular “deal breaker” consistently surfaces in conversations with potential returnees. He did not spell it out immediately, but stressed that this single factor alone is enough to make several NRIs reconsider moving back. “As we are approaching retirement age, some US friends are asking how life in India really is,” he wrote. “Just think about it — NRIs with $$ ready to contribute to the Indian economy, but not coming back because of this one issue. We need to fix it on a war footing.” His post quickly gained traction. By the latest update, it had crossed 7.6 lakh views and drawn hundreds of comments, most of them echoing Naresh’s concerns. As the conversation picked up, users began sharing their own perspectives on the challenges of retiring in India — from infrastructure limitations to the pressures of life in rapidly growing cities — and the factors that influence an NRI’s decision to return home. One user argued, “We are 1.5 billion people. That naturally means crowds and traffic. Even China has them.” Naresh responded, “It’s the chaos of Indian traffic that is frustrating.

Relations between the two neighbours have soured recently after Takaichi became the first sitting Japanese leader in decades to publicly link a Taiwan Strait crisis with the possible deployment of Japanese troops. Her remarks drew swift retaliation from Beijing , which warned of more to come. China has demanded that Takaichi retract her statement, and state media blasted her comments, saying they “sound a stark warning that Japan’s militarist demons are being summoned anew.” Japan, meanwhile, said Kanai reiterated that the country’s position on Taiwan remains unchanged. Kanai also pushed back against “extremely inappropriate statements” made by Xue Jian, China’s consul general in Osaka, who threatened to cut off Takaichi’s head in a now-deleted post on X. Tokyo demanded immediate action against the diplomat. The back-and-forth between the two sides suggests the dispute shows little sign of easing. Beijing has also warned Chinese citizens against travelling to Japan. This move has already led at least two state-owned travel agencies to scrap group tours to Japan, booked months in advance, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.

India does not need an official declaration to be a 'Hindu rashtra'. Its civilisational ethos already reflects it,\" said Bhagwat, the head of RSS, the fountainhead of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Addressing concerns about \"demographic changes\" in Assam, Bhagwat called for confidence, vigilance, and firm attachment to one's land and identity. He spoke about issues such as illegal infiltration, the need for a balanced population policy including a three-child norm for Hindus, and the importance of resisting divisive religious conversions. Bhagwat also advocated for the responsible use of social media, especially among young people. Describing the Northeast as a shining example of India's unity in diversity, he said that figures like Lachit Borphukan and Srimanta Shankardeva hold not just regional importance but national relevance and inspire all Indians. Bhagwat urged all sections of society to work collectively and selflessly for the nation's building.

Centred on men's mental and physical health, the day promotes positive male role models and aims to lift prejudices and discrimination. With an aim to foster a more inclusive and empathetic society for all men and boys, the celebrations seek to encourage healthier and more balanced gender relations. The origin of International Men's Day can be traced back to the 1999 Trinidad and Tobago. The idea of the International Men's Day first emerged in February 1991 but it was inaugurated only a year later on 7 February 1992 by Thomas Oaster. The longest running celebration of International Men's Day take place in Malta since 7 February 1994. However, the Maltese AMR Committee in 2009 decided to shift the date to 19 November, aligning with global celebrations. Over time, the idea of celebrating men and their contribution to the society gained currency and spread to more than 80 countries. Although International Men's Day is not officially recognised by the United Nations like the International Women's Day, but it has become a global celebration to recognise positive male role models and their contribution to society. A day to appreciate healthy masculinity and champion equality, International Men’s Day celebration is guided by the 6 pillars which are as follows: This day makes a difference as it brings attention to concerning issues frequently overlooked, like stress, emotional struggles and suicide. It encourages healthier and more balanced gender relations and supports system men and boys. This day provides a platform to men to address unspoken emotional and mental health issues and realise their full potential by ensuring equal opportunities to grow and thrive.

In an Instagram video, Vicky Kumar revealed that his base salary is 235,000 yen (around ₹ 1.35 lakh). However, without an entry-level Japanese language certification, he faces a monthly deduction of 20,000 yen. After standard cuts like income tax and health insurance, his take-home salary comes down to roughly 175,000 yen — just about ₹ 1 lakh. Kumar’s breakdown quickly gained traction, prompting viewers to debate whether a fresher’s salary of this level is sufficient in Japan, a country known for its relatively high living costs. To put it in context, estimated monthly expenses for a single person in Tokyo in 2025 range between 150,000 and 350,000 yen ( ₹ 84,000– ₹ 1.96 lakh), depending on lifestyle and location. Comparisons also surfaced with India’s tech sector, where freshers typically earn between ₹ 5 lakh and ₹ 7 lakh annually — with higher packages in hubs like Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The video has since gone viral, sparking larger conversations around global pay gaps, the real cost of living abroad and whether earning ₹ 1 lakh in Japan translates to a better lifestyle than earning the same amount in India. A user asked, “Isn't it's too low?” Another user wrote, “But Japan's expensive so making 50k-60k in india is equivalent.” The third user asked, “What is the minimum salary required for a fresher to live in Japan?” The fourth user questioned, “Brothers, how much will the expenses save in 1 lakh by cutting the expenses like house rent, food, and other expenses?” The fifth asked, “What about educational background like degree, skills, internships or experience?” In another video, he revealed that he works for 5 days a week and gets public holidays and paid leaves.

At that cost, the payments would reportedly exceed more than a year’s worth of tariff revenue, leaving no funds for the other purposes Trump has mentioned, such as debt reduction or farmer relief. After months of hinting at the idea, Trump and his economic team have recently increased public discussion of the checks, as the president seeks to pressure the Supreme Court to uphold his broader tariff programme. According to a Forbes report, Trump mentioned last week that the payments would come “sometime next year, during the year\", adding, “We’ve taken in a lot of money from tariffs. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend.” While stating that the promised $2,000 would not be issued to “high-income people\", Trump took to Truth Social on 9 November and said, “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS! We are now the Richest, Most Respected Country in the World, With Almost No Inflation, and A Record Stock Market Price. 401k’s are Highest EVER.” He further said, \"We are taking in Trillions of Dollars and will soon begin paying down our ENORMOUS DEBT, $37 trillion.

The Labor Department only published the so-called continuing claims data for the weeks ending October 11 and 18. The government would have surveyed businesses and households for October's employment report during the week ending October 18. A Labor Department spokesperson said \"a technical issue caused the early posting of partial data,\" adding \"this is being corrected and the complete series will be available by close of business on Nov. 20, 2025,\" a Labor Department spokesperson said in response to a query from Reuters. No official weekly claims data had been published since late September because of the recently ended 43-day shutdown of the government. Separately, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said it would publish September's producer price report next Tuesday and the import and export price data on December 3. The White House has warned the unemployment rate for October will likely not be published after the longest shutdown in history prevented the collection of data from households. The number of people receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.957 million during the week ended October 18, the data showed. Continuing claims shot up from the 1.916 million level in the week ended September 13.

OK with me, whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said Monday, adding that he’s “not happy with Mexico.” The US Embassy in Mexico shared a video through social platform X later Monday that included previous comments from Rubio saying that the U.S. would not take unilateral action in Mexico. Meanwhile, Mexican and US diplomats were trying to sort out Tuesday what may have been an actual US incursion. On Monday, men arrived in a boat to a beach in northeast Mexico and installed some signs signaling land that the US Department of Defense considered restricted. Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said late Monday that the country’s Navy had removed the signs, which appeared to be on Mexican territory. And on Tuesday, Sheinbaum said that the International Boundary and Water Commission, a binational agency that determines the border between the two countries, was getting involved. The signs, driven into the sand near where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico, caused a stir when witnesses said men in a boat arrived at the local beach known as Playa Bagdad and erected them.

Clay Higgins of Louisiana cast the lone vote against the bill, despite chairing a subcommittee that recently subpoenaed the Justice Department for the same documents. Abuse survivors rallied outside the Capitol on Tuesday morning, describing years of trauma and government inaction. “These women have fought the most horrific fight that no woman should have to fight,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , standing alongside several survivors. “We fought so hard against the most powerful people in the world, even the president of the United States, to make this vote happen today.” Survivor Jena-Lisa Jones, who said she voted for Trump, pleaded with the president directly: “I beg you, Donald Trump, please stop making this political.” Despite calling the bill a “raw and obvious political exercise,” Speaker Johnson said he would vote for it to avoid appearing opposed to transparency. “None of us want to go on record… being accused of not being for maximum transparency,” he said. Democrats hailed the vote as a historic win for the minority. “It’s a complete and total surrender,” said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries . “The survivors and the American people deserve full and complete transparency.” The House Oversight Committee has already released thousands of pages of documents from Epstein’s estate , revealing ties to global leaders, financiers, political figures — and Trump himself.

Criticising Powell for not lowering interest rates faster, Trump stated, \"Frankly, I would love to get the guy currently in there out right now, but people are holding me back.

On Tuesday, he again reiterated that Scott Bessent did not want the job.

During his first White House visit in seven years, MBS said Saudi Arabia had “done all the right steps” to investigate Khashoggi’s death. “It’s painful and it’s a huge mistake,” the crown prince said , adding that the kingdom is “doing our best that this doesn’t happen again.” The journalist, a Washington Post columnist and outspoken critic of the Saudi leadership, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi agents. President Donald Trump contradicted US intelligence assessments that the crown prince likely approved the killing, instead offering a defense of MBS. “Whether you like him or don’t like him, things happen,” Trump told reporters, insisting “he knew nothing about it.” He went further, describing Khashoggi as “extremely controversial,” saying, “A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about… but he (the prince) knew nothing about it.” Despite global condemnation of the killing, Trump hailed the crown prince’s leadership and rights record. “We have an extremely respected man in the Oval Office today… a very good friend of mine,” Trump said. “I’m very proud of the job he’s done. What he’s done is incredible, in terms of human rights and everything else.” Declassified US intelligence findings released in 2021 concluded that MBS did likely approve the operation targeting Khashoggi.

The Kremlin said that Russia would not be sending anyone to Turkey, and it was not immediately clear if there would be U.S. participation in the talks. Zelenskyy told a news conference in Spain that he would meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss “a just peace for Ukraine.” Zelenskyy’s statement came as Ukraine’s military said it had again used American-supplied ATACMS missiles to attack targets inside Russia, although it did not provide further details. Kyiv says that the use of longer-range missiles is vital in preventing strikes against Ukrainian cities, while the Kremlin has warned that the use of American weapons to strike targets inside its territory risks greater pressure on Russian-U.S. relations. A senior Turkish official told The Associated Press that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff would join Zelenskyy in Turkey, but backtracked later in the day and said Witkoff wouldn’t be coming. Zelenskyy did not confirm whether U.S. representatives would also take part. “We see some positions and signals from the United States,” he said. \"Well, let’s see tomorrow.” Three U.S. officials said they were not aware of any imminent overseas travel by Witkoff, though they acknowledged he is not a government employee and sometimes travels without U.S. government support. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said Witkoff would be in Washington for much of this week to attend events related to a state visit by the Saudi crown prince on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.
