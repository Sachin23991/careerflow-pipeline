How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank. Also Read | IIT Delhi BTech Placement Trends: Top-packages, companies Tests vary in difficulty with each session (so scores are not the same). Two students who score differently on the same exam can have the same percentile and therefore the same rank. Colleges determine your admission to a college and branch as well as rank using solely your percentile (raw marks are not included). Therefore, the percentile will always be viewed as the best benchmark for determining a good score on the JEE Main examination. Also Read| Is NCERT enough for preparation?

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits. Goa marks the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in early December, a major religious observance that can lead to localised school holidays.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said. The government is also working to finalise a transparent transfer policy, he said. “A government doctor (MBBS) is required to serve three years in a rural hospital to get a chance to pursue MD or MS.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction. Germany has crossed 4 lakh international students in the 2024/25 winter semester, supported by dual-citizenship reforms. France aims to welcome 30,000 Indian students by 2030, pairing this target with clearer employment pathways.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Out of 720 marks, a massive 360 marks come from Biology alone. That’s half the paper, making it the most decisive and scoring subject in the exam. But here’s the truth: Biology isn’t just about memorising lines from a textbook. It’s about understanding life itself. And when you truly understand it, cracking NEET becomes much easier. NEET UG 2026 Physics Preparation Tips to Score 180 Marks Biology beautifully unfolds into two fascinating branches: Botany and Zoology. Botany lets you explore the world of plants, their structure, diversity, colours, and the incredible processes that keep our environment balanced. It helps you understand how genes pass from one generation to another and how biotechnology enhances human life. NEET UG 2026 Chemistry Preparation Tips Zoology brings you closer to the inner workings of living beings, such as respiration, blood circulation, and reproduction. It’s a deep dive into how the human body maintains harmony every single second. Together, these branches not only help you score well but also allow you to appreciate how life thrives in every form around you. If you want to master NEET Biology, strategy matters as much as study hours. Here’s how you can prepare smartly: –Make NCERT your foundation. It’s the most reliable book for NEET Biology. –Understand first, then memorise. Rote learning without understanding leads to confusion. –Read NCERT repeatedly. Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly.

It said that the exams will be conducted between November 17 and the end of December 2025. However, exam preparations soon came to a halt due to a legal challenge related to eligibility criteria, first taken up in the Delhi High Court and later transferred to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). Throughout this period, the High Court’s stay order prevented RRBs from moving forward with any exam-related activities. This uncertainty continued for months and became the largest bottleneck in the recruitment calendar. Finally, on November 12, 2025, the CAT dismissed the petition, affirming that both Class 10th-pass and ITI-qualified candidates remain eligible for the Level-1 posts. The ruling lifted all legal barriers and gave RRBs a clear path to conduct the exam.

The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S. Formerly known as Sendinblue , Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M. The U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. “That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch. Revenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards. After joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch. That’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026.

The unsurprising theme is AI for the enterprise. This year it’s all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. “We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.

This is a significant hire for Meta, as the company makes a push toward consumer devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth. At Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg. It seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade soup to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.) Shortly after the news broke of Dye’s departure, Zuckerberg announced a new creative studio within Reality Labs that would be led by Dye. There, he’ll be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another former Apple designer who led interface design across Reality Labs; Joshua To, who led interface design across Reality Labs; Meta’s industrial design team, led by Pete Bristol; and its metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin. Zuckerberg said the studio would “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” “Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. “We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.” This article was updated ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/meta-poaches-apple-design-exec-alan-dye-to-lead-new-creative-studio-in-reality-labs/", "timestamp": 1764826432.9818077}

Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year . Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy? It’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. So it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public. “You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin. “At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people. Like other major creators, the MrBeast business expands far beyond YouTube ad revenue and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg. Housenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already).

Roblox is a user-generated content platform where players can create and share their own games and experiences, similar to Minecraft. The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “ extremist activity. “ According to a translation of an article in TASS , a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban. Roblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon. The ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent reports have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators. In the U.S., Roblox has faced legal probes from the attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana. Roblox has since introduced age checks and content moderation tools aimed at keeping children safe — beginning in January, the company plans to implement mandatory facial verification to access Roblox’s chat features. (However, facial verification technology comes with safety concerns of its own.) Roblox has also asked developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content. This sparked backlash from advocacy groups like Out Making Games, Women in Games, and BAME in Games, which represent minority groups in the gaming industry. In an open letter , the groups wrote that Roblox considered topics like “pay equity in sports” to be “sensitive.” “While parental controls serve an important purpose, they shouldn’t come at the expense of fundamental human dignity,” the letter said. “We are calling on Roblox to reconsi", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/roblox-banned-in-russia-local-media-says/", "timestamp": 1764826433.1791074}

Maybe not entirely, but Amazon is already making big bucks trying.", "content": "Can any company, big or small, really topple Nvidia’s AI chip dominance? Maybe not. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those who can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week. As expected, the company revealed at the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is 4x faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip. He said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.” Bedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models. Jassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market. That is, of course, Amazon’s classic MO , offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices. Additionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an interview with CRN , about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic. “We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said. Project Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October .

With CEOs from Ford and Stellantis in attendance, President Donald Trump proposed rolling back fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. The regulation change also reclassifies crossovers as cars instead of light trucks, and it eliminates automakers’ ability to trade electric vehicle credits. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates fuel economy rules under Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. Those rules, first enacted by Congress in 1975, dictate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations. Trump also said he would authorize the Department of Transportation to allow automakers to manufacture “really small cars” like the kind found in Japan and South Korea. The White House claims that existing regulations would have caused automotive prices to increase by $1,000 per vehicle. The previous Trump administration made the same argument in 2020, when it last rolled back fuel economy standards. Since that rollback, though, the price of a new vehicle has climbed to new heights , topping $50,000 on average, as automakers discontinued low-end models to capitalize on consumers’ preferences for SUVs. Larger vehicles use more material , thus costing more to make, while also getting lower fuel economy. Consumers’ choices appear to run counter to the administration’s contention that lower fuel economies are in the car-buying public’s interests. For instance, hybrid sales are up significantly this year over last and momentum continues. Hybrid sales grew 6% in October over the previous month. Experts doubt that lower fuel economy stan", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/trump-administration-rolls-back-fuel-economy-standards-again/", "timestamp": 1764826433.3775856}

At the company’s annual “ State of the Word ” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among other examples. Telex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website. While the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. In the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something that a developer used to have to custom-build but could now be created in a few seconds. In another demo, a developer used Telex to add real-time store hours, a phone number, and a link to get directions to the header block of their WordPress site. Telex was also shown being used to create a carousel of partner logos on a business’s site, a custom pricing tool, a Google Calendar integration, and a grid for posts on a WordPress homepage, where each post’s card on the site had the same height. “Again, things that you used to have to, like, hire developers, do custom software like this would have cost thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to build, even just years ago.

The company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. However, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.” Even so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” This approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance. Kingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically. “Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners. This early aggressive funding contrasts with the last investment cycle. “The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures. He pointed out that massive funding into Uber and Lyft was a canonical example of this, but the capital weaponization for the ride-sharing companies didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.

Anticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.” The company’s use of the expression “ end-to-end encryption ” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. By reading Kohler’s privacy policy , it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. Using the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. A Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.” The security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.” The Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.

Texas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States. At least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed.

The TVA will build one 300-megawatt reactor from GE Vernova Hitachi in Tennessee, while Holtec will build two of its 300-megawatt reactors in Michigan. Tech companies have warmed to nuclear power in recent years as their demand for electricity has grown alongside their AI ambitions. The reactors to be built are considered Generation III+ designs, which are refinements of existing designs that have been in use for decades. By shrinking them down to “small modular” size, the hope is that costs will come down as parts are mass produced and engineering and construction crews become more familiar with building them. To date, though, only two small modular reactors are operational, according to the World Nuclear Association. Topics Tonight!

AWS announced new capabilities in Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI at its AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday. These new capabilities are designed to make building and fine-tuning custom large language models (LLMs) easier for developers. The cloud provider is introducing serverless model customization in SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure, according to Ankur Mehrotra, general manager of AI platforms at AWS, in an interview with TechCrunch. To access these serverless model-building capabilities, developers can either follow a self-guided point-and-click path or an agent-led experience where they can prompt SageMaker using natural language. The agent-led feature is launching in preview. “If you’re a healthcare customer and you wanted a model to be able to understand certain medical terminology better, you can simply point SageMaker AI, if you have labeled data, then select the technique and then off SageMaker goes, and [it] fine tunes the model,” Mehrotra said. This capability is available for customizing Amazon’s own Nova models and certain open source models (those with publicly available model weights), including DeepSeek and Meta’s Llama. AWS is also launching Reinforcement Fine-Tuning in Bedrock that allows developers to choose either a reward function or a pre-set workflow, and Bedrock will run a model customization process automatically from start to finish. Frontier LLMs — meaning the most advanced AI models — and model customization appear to be an area of focus for AWS at this year’s conference.

The deal, announced Tuesday, marks the latest acquisition for the 12-year-old company that has quietly become one of the tech industry’s most prolific buyers — despite remaining largely unknown to the general public. So what exactly is Bending Spoons? Despite its catchy name, the company has stayed remarkably under the radar, and it typically makes headlines only when it adds another recognizable brand to its portfolio — which now includes Evernote, WeTransfer, Meetup, and StreamYard, among others. But Bending Spoons isn’t a traditional private equity firm or a pure financial investment vehicle. Its focus is on acquiring underperforming but popular tech brands, then transforming them to serve millions of users more efficiently. The company tends to make news when it restructures these acquired companies, often through significant layoffs , or makes controversial changes to beloved products — as it did with both Evernote and WeTransfer. Still, Bending Spoons remains largely unknown, even though its roster of products has served more than a billion people, with over 300 million monthly active users and 10 million paying customers. Here’s what you need to know about the company reshaping some of the internet’s most recognizable brands. Bending Spoons describes itself as a company that acquires and transforms digital businesses. Having grown to a headcount of 400 to 500 employees (whom the company calls “Spooners”), its main focus is on making improvements to products and services that others have created. However, it didn’t start that way — Bending Spoons’ founders had taken a stab at building their own apps and products before eventually shifting their focus. The little-known backstory is that Bending Spoons was born out of the remains of Evertale, a Copenhagen-based startup that", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/what-is-bending-spoons-everything-to-know-about-aols-acquirer/", "timestamp": 1764826434.3835413}

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) said Tuesday that Republican leaders would look for “other places” to include the measure — an effort that President Trump has supported — according to The Hill . The proposal to preempt states from enacting their own AI regulation came months after GOP lawmakers sought to include a 10-year moratorium on state AI laws in Trump’s tax and spending bill earlier this year. The provision failed then due to strong resistance from both parties. Silicon Valley has supported such measures, arguing that state regulations create an unworkable patchwork of rules that could stymy innovation. Critics argue that most state AI legislation is focused on safety, transparency, and consumer protections, and in the absence of federal AI laws that perform those tasks, blocking states from regulating would be effectively handing over control to Big Tech with no oversight. Scalise reportedly acknowledged that the defense bill was not the place to include such a provision, and echoed Trump’s previous calls to introduce the ban as a separate bill. A leaked draft executive order signals Trump is considering taking matters into his own hands, though those efforts have reportedly paused for now. Topics Tonight!

The Neue Klasse range uses the sixth generation of BMW eDrive tech, boasting “ cell-to-pack ” batteries with liquid-cooled cylindrical cells consisting of higher nickel and less cobalt content for a 20-percent bump in energy density.

In response, digital and human rights organization Fight for the Future is hosting a week of events —across Reddit , LinkedIn, and various livestreams —to raise awareness of how it believes these bills are setting a dangerous precedent by making the internet more exploitative rather than safer. Many of the proposed bills include a clause for ID or age verification, which forces people to upload an ID, allow a face scan, or otherwise authenticate that they are not a minor before viewing adult content. Fight for the Future says the policies will lead to increased censorship and surveillance. Among the 19 bills considered at the hearing conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed with sweeping bipartisan approval in the Senate last year, and the Reducing Exploitative Social Media Exposure for Teens Act , which would ban tech companies from allowing minors under the age of 16 on their platforms. In addition to age verification, the bills raised concerns over issues of parental controls, consumer research of minors, AI, and data privacy. “We’re seeing this huge wave toward ID checks being the norm in tech policy, and it felt like we needed to capture the already activated communities who are not feeling heard in Congress,” says Sarah Philips, a campaigner with Fight for the Future. “If you look on YouTube, if you see people making content about KOSA or responding to a lot of this legislation, it’s very unpopular with people. But it’s viewed on the Hill as very common-sense.” Missouri’s age-gate law took effect earlier this week, meaning 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

This could have implications far outside gaming.", "content": "The video game Valorant , a fast-paced team-based shooter , has recently become a testing ground for a promising new direction in artificial intelligence research. The game’s developers at Riot Games (a Tencent subsidiary) are using 3D-native AI models to prototype new characters, scenes, and storylines, according to a researcher familiar with the company’s efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. While many AI models can generate text, images, and video, Tencent’s Hunyuan (混元 or “first mix”) family of models can dream up 3D objects and interactive scenes. The source says that Tencent’s models are also being used by the developers of another Tencent game, GKART , and by some independent developers, too. Tencent declined to comment. “The games industry requires a lot of investment,” the source says. “Previously you would need a month to design a character. Now you can just type in some text, and Hunyuan can give you four choices in 60 seconds.” The news is an early signal that models capable of understanding and re-creating the physical world could become a standard ingredient in game design. In addition to generating game content, these models could also enable more advanced virtual and augmented reality and help robots learn to do new things. “There’s a real explosion of 3D vision research nowadays,” says Alexander Raistrick , a graduate student at Princeton University working on novel approaches to generating 3D content. “There are many killer applications: There's content creation, there’s self driving, and there’s a whole stack of problems involved in augmented reality.” Raistrick adds that video games are an obvious application for 3D AI models. “Outputting 3D meshes [a standard way of representing 3D objects] is your typical kind of bread and butter of game development,” he says.

Here's How and When to View It", "summary": "The best opportunity to view this spectacle will be shortly after sunset on December 4.", "content": "A cold supermoon is on its way. On December 4, Earth's satellite will delight us with one of the last astronomical spectacles of 2025. Not only will it be the last full moon of the year, but it's also a cold moon—which refers to the frigid temperatures typical of this time of year—and, finally, a supermoon . Here's how and when best to enjoy this spectacle of the year-end sky. The term supermoon refers to a full moon that occurs when our satellite is at perigee, the point at which its orbit brings it closest to our planet. (The moon's orbit is elliptical, and its distance from Earth varies between about 407,000 km at apogee, the point of maximum distance, and about 380,000 at perigee.) In addition to being the third consecutive supermoon of the year, as reported by EarthSky , it will be about 357,000 km away from us, making it the second-closest full Moon of the year. Consequently it will also be the second-largest and brightest. Although most of us won't notice any difference in size compared to a normal full moon (it appears up to 8 percent larger to us), its brightness could exceed that of an ordinary full Moon by 16 percent. This time, moreover, it will be 100 percent illuminated just 12 hours after its perigee. In addition to its name, which refers to the cold temperatures of this period, December's full moon will be the last of 12 full moons in 2025 and the highest of the year. With the winter solstice approaching on December 21, the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, so the full moon is at its highest point. In other words, this means that the super cold moon will be particularly high in the sky. As EarthSky points out, however, it is not the closest full Moon to the December 21 solstice. While it occurs 17 days before, the first full moon of 2026 will occer on January 3—just 12 days ater teh solstice. That will be the fourth and last consecutive supermoon. Although the moon may appear full both the night before and the night after, the exact time of the ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/cold-moon-supermoon-december-how-to-view/", "timestamp": 1764826435.730342}

It’s a Shit Show", "summary": "The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport, even offering money. But some immigrants say it’s been nearly impossible.", "content": "A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport . The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims. Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure. She says the call never came. This isn’t what’s supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home , which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out.

It’s whispered in the circles of financial masters of the universe, Hollywood stars, and owners of sports teams. Have you heard about Fortell? Many haven’t—or if they did hear, they might not have made out the words through noisy cross-conversations. Once they do know—particularly if they’re boomers—they want it desperately. Fortell is a hearing aid, one that claims to use AI to provide a dramatically superior aural experience. The chosen few included in its beta test claim that it seems to top the performance of high-end devices they’d been unhappily using. These testers have made pilgrimages to Fortell’s headquarters on the fifth floor of a WeWork facility in New York City’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, where they were fitted for the hearing aids—which from the outside look pretty much like standard, over-the-ear, teardrop-shaped devices. But the big moment comes when a Fortell staffer takes them down to street level. There, among street clatter, honking cabs, and delivery trucks backing up to luxury stores, they are asked to conduct a conversation with a Fortell worker. Two other employees stand behind them, adding their own loud discourse to the urban cacophony. Despite the din, the testers clearly make out what the person in front of them is saying. The clouds lift. Angels croon. “This was so incredible that I burst into tears,” says Ashley Tudor, one of the seemingly few beta testers who isn’t famous or powerful (though she is married to a venture capitalist). Meryl Hartzband has her hearing tested by audiologist Kathleen Wallace at Fortell in late November. Among the age-related-hearing-loss set, getting into the Fortell beta test has become a weird status symbol, the aural-prosthetics version of a limited-edition Birkin bag. “This product has become a major flex for the post-70 set,” says one investor.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies .

But the stunt could reduce stigma around psychedelics.", "content": "“Come watch me trip balls,” declared Bryan Johnson , the “Don’t Die” longevity entrepreneur, on X a couple of days before he livestreamed himself consuming a high dose of psychedelic mushrooms at a psilocybin center in Oregon on Sunday . It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug. The five-and-a-half-hour livestream, which has been viewed more than 1.1 million times, also featured Johnson’s 20-year-old son Talmage, whose blood he has injected in his efforts to stay young, journalist Ashlee Vance, a DJ set from Grimes, and Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff. YouTuber MrBeast, while pictured on a cartoonish poster advertising the event, did not show up, which most extremely high people would probably count as a blessing.

Not only would the streamer be adding Mad Men —a show that HBO execs infamously passed on back when Matthew Weiner was a writer on The Sopranos —but it would be presenting the period drama’s episodes in a new 4K remastering. This would, according to the press release , give “audiences and longtime Mad Men fans the opportunity to enjoy the series’ authentically crafted elements with crisp detail and enhanced visual clarity.” As it turned out, there was perhaps too much clarity. Not long after the series went live on HBO Max, a screencap began floating around social media from a scene in the Season One episode “Red in the Face,” where Roger Sterling is vomiting in front of a group of horrified Sterling Cooper clients. When it aired—and in the version still available on AMC+—seven men are onscreen, all of them wearing period-appropriate suits and ties. The HBO Max version, on the other hand, features two men who appear very out of place in 1960: crew members lurking in the background, feeding a hose to create the illusion that actor John Slattery is puking: As of this morning, some episodes were also mislabeled, so you had to click on the episode labeled “Babylon” to see Roger’s stomach-churning display. It’s the kind of moment for which Mad Men ’s own “Not great, Bob!” meme was invented. This is, unfortunately, not the first time this has happened when a classic series has changed platforms and/or formats. Most shows that originated in the 20th century were filmed in standard definition, in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio. Putting the images into a higher resolution, and then reframing them for widescreen television, has created similar problems. Crew members could also be seen in some Buffy the Vampire Slayer shots when the supernatural teen drama was converted to widescreen. “Gender Bender,” an X-Files episode about a killer who can change back and forth from male to female, when moved to widescreen had", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/hbo-maxs-mad-men-barf-scene-proves-remastered-doesnt-mean-better/", "timestamp": 1764826437.2081099}

If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes. The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to autom", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/", "timestamp": 1764826437.9494429}

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says. One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit , which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform’s rules.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades.

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not just Choi.

Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon If you're shopping for a laptop on Cyber Monday, you're probably looking for something a bit more budget-friendly. While the MacBook Air is the better laptop, there's no question that the Dell 14 Plus is the best deal . It comes with great specs: 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V. I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad. It's literally a premium laptop for an affordable price, and at $500, it's officially the best deal on a laptop this Cyber Monday It's a doorbuster-style deal, however, so once it's sold out, the price may change.

These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies. We haven't tested any of the below items—I might for my Gifts for Plant Lovers guide—but here are some other sales on interesting Vego items that might be worth checking out: • Raised Garden Bed Kit for $153 ($27 off) : OK, I might actually buy this myself.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now.

Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room.

It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played. For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR.

Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them.

Samsung Amazon (S25) Amazon (S25)+ Amazon (Ultra) Samsung (All) Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is seeing healthy discounts this Cyber Monday, probably because its successors are right around the corner—the Galaxy S26 series is expected to be announced in January. But if you don't really need the latest and greatest, you have three excellent smartphones to choose from. The S25 is the smallest, the S25+ gets a few extra perks plus a bigger screen and better battery life, but it's the Galaxy S25 Ultra that really steps things up, with a dual telephoto camera system, integrated S Pen stylus, and a beefy battery. Read our Best Samsung Phones guide for more details about each of these devices. Google Amazon (10) Amazon (XL) Amazon (Pro) Best Buy One of my favorite parts of Google's new Pixel 10 series (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is that they're the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnetic wireless charging .

Norway, however, is bucking the trend—thanks to a tax incentive system that will soon be rolled back.", "content": "The slump does not stop. Tesla sales in Europe slumped again in November 2025, confirming a negative trend that has been going on for more than a year. Data reported by Reuters shows monthly registrations of Tesla automobiles—an accurate way of measuring sales—halved compared to the same month in 2024 in the continent's main markets: down 58 percent in France, minus 59 percent in Sweden, and  down 49 percent in Denmark. In Germany, where the Elon Musk -controlled automaker has its only European plant, on the outskirts of Berlin, recorded just 750 vehicles sold in October, less than half the number sold a year earlier. The big exception to this downward trend is in Norway, where registrations of Tesla cars nearly tripled, to 6,215 units. The numbers for the first 10 months of 2025 expose a structural crisis. Tesla lost about 30 percent of European sales compared to the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association , the body that groups the industry's manufacturers on the Continent. Tesla's market share in the electric car segment fell from 12.6 percent in May 2024 to 7.2 percent in May 2025, according to analysis by Schmidt Automotive. Volkswagen took the lead among electric vehicle manufacturers by selling 133,465 units in the first six months of the year versus Tesla's 108,878, and Chinese manufacturer BYD sold more than twice as many cars as its US rival in October. The reasons for the decline are many. Musk's political stances have alienated a significant portion of his European customer base, particularly in Germany where the entrepreneur has publicly supported Alternative für Deutschland, Germany's far-right party known as AfD. Musk's virtual participation in an AfD election rally in January 2025, during which he called on Germans to overcome guilt over their Nazi past, triggered a wave of boycotts.

It has three speed settings and five interchangeable heads (fork, ball, cushion, flat, and bullet), and it's built with a pressure sensor that lets you know when you're pushing too hard, kind of like an electric toothbrush.

In a post on X, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote, “Women are the manager of the home, not a servant for you to say, “Why didn’t you do this? Why didn’t you do that? Why isn’t the house clean?” A woman is like a flower.

The Islamic Republic has refuted that nonsensical logic.” Declaring that women can be active in all fields of life as per Islam, including society, in business and work, in political activities and in most governmental positions, he said, “Safeguarding a woman’s security, dignity, and honor is one of women’s rights.

The policy shift, first reported by Reuters , marks one of the most significant expansions of immigration screening under the current administration, and could affect thousands of skilled workers seeking employment in the United States. In an internal cable dated 2 December and circulated to all US missions globally, consular officials were instructed to analyse the online LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants — and even their accompanying family members — for past employment in fields linked to information control or online content governance. “BE ON THE LOOKOUT: APPLICANTS RESPONSIBLE FOR OR COMPLICIT IN CENSORSHIP OF AMERICANS,” the cable seen by Bloomberg read. According to Reuters and Bloomberg , the memo orders officers to examine whether applicants have worked in areas involving “misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others.” The cable goes further, stating: “If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,” citing a specific provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  This standard, if enforced broadly, could sweep in employees from major technology firms, media organisations, AI companies, trust-and-safety teams, and academic research institutes.

The Indian Air Force hailed the S-400 — a cutting-edge surface-to-air missile platform — as the ‘game-changer’ of the three-day confrontation. Now, with Russian President Vladimir Putin set to arrive in India today, New Delhi is setting its sights on the S-400’s bigger, stronger, and smarter successor: the S-500 Prometheus air shield. India's keenness in procuring S-400 missile systems, upgrading Sukhoi 30 fighter jets, and purchasing other critical military hardware from Russia will be on the agenda for talks between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and his Russian counterpart, Andrey Belousov, on Thursday. Belousov will be part of Russian President Vladimir Putin's delegation to India. The talks between the two defence ministers will take place a day ahead of the summit meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Putin. During the meeting with Belousov, the Indian side is likely to push for the supply of military hardware within the prescribed timeframe. India may also consider procuring the S-500 missile systems from Russia, according to media reports. The S-500 Prometheus is Russia’s latest next-generation air and missile defence system, designed to defeat a wide spectrum of advanced threats — from stealth aircraft and drones to ballistic missiles, hypersonic glide vehicles, and even select low-Earth-orbit (LEO) objects. Developed by Almaz-Antey, the S-500 represents a significant leap forward from the S-400, expanding air defence into the near-space layer. With an interception range of roughly 500–600 km and a strike altitude of 180–200 km, it functions as a strategic, national-level shield, rather than a conventional battlefield system .

In comments at the New York Times' DealBook Summit, Bessent criticized several presidents of the Fed's regional banks, saying that they were not from the districts that they now represent, “a disconnect from the original framing” of the Fed. Bessent said that three of the 12 regional presidents have ties to New York: Two previously worked at the New York Federal Reserve , while a third worked at a New York investment bank. “So, do they represent their district?” he asked. “I am going to start advocating, going forward, not retroactively, that regional Fed presidents must have lived in their district for at least three years.” Bessent added that he wasn’t sure if Congress would need to weigh in on such a change. Under current law, the Fed's Washington, D.C.-based board can block the appointment of regional Fed presidents. “I believe that you would just say, unless someone’s lived in the district for three years, we’re going to veto them,” Bessent said. Bessent has stepped up his criticism of the Fed’s 12 regional bank presidents in recent weeks after several of them made clear in a series of speeches that they opposed cutting the Fed’s key rate at its next meeting in December. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized the Fed for not lowering its short-term interest rate more quickly.

The Winter Egg, commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II in 1913 for his mother, went to an anonymous bidder after a brief three-minute contest at Christie’s in London. The price slightly surpassed the auction house’s estimate of £20 million ($26 million). The huge sum reflects the extreme scarcity of the House of Fabergé’s Imperial creations. Only 50 eggs were ever produced, and the Winter Egg is among just seven still in private hands. None have appeared at auction for more than two decades, with the rest either unaccounted for or held by museums. In an emailed statement, the head of Christie’s Fabergé and Russian artworks department, Margo Oganesian told CNN that the new record “reaffirmed the enduring significance” and the “rarity and brilliance” of what many consider one of Fabergé’s finest objects. Prior to the sale, she described it as “the most spectacular, artistically inventive and unusual” of the entire series, adding that “the design is timeless — it’s so modern.” Crafted largely from rock crystal, the egg is designed to evoke a frozen block dusted with frost. Its casing features a platinum snowflake pattern set with 4,500 rose-cut diamonds , while the interior conceals a delicate basket of wood anemones made from white quartz, nephrite and garnets — one of Fabergé’s famous hidden “surprises.” Unusually for the era, the piece was designed by a woman, Alma Pihl, who is said to have drawn inspiration from observing ice crystals forming on her workshop window. Nicholas II purchased it for 24,600 roubles, one of the highest prices Fabergé ever charged.

During the two-day stay in the national capital, President Putin will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on regional and global issues of mutual interest. This is President Putin’s first official trip to India since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. Putin last visited India in December 2021. Several agreements are expected to be signed, covering areas such as trade, economy, healthcare, academia, culture, and media during the Russian president's visit to India. The broader goal of the visit is to shore up the bilateral strategic and economic partnership between the two nations, against the backdrop of a sharp downturn in India's relations with the US. Putin is expected to land in New Delhi on Thursday evening. Thereafter, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host a private dinner for him at his official residence on Lok Kalyan Marg in reciprocation of a similar gesture extended to the Indian prime minister by the Russian leader during his visit to Moscow in July last year. Putin’s main engagements are scheduled for Friday, beginning with a visit to Rajghat, followed by a ceremonial welcome at Rashtrapati Bhavan . The leaders will hold talks at Hyderabad House for the main summit. After lunch with Modi on Friday, Putin will participate in the India-Russia Business Forum. He will return to Rashtrapati Bhavan, where President Droupadi Murmu will host a banquet in his honour.

For a community that has endured years of rhetorical targeting, the ferocity of this week’s remarks marked a new escalation. Speaking after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Donald Trump delivered one of his harshest assessments yet of Somali Americans. “They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” the US president told reporters. “We can go one way or the other, and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.” Donald Trump followed the comments with an even blunter remark: “When they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but bitch. We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it!” Trump doubled down: “Somalians should be out of here. They’ve destroyed our country.” The US president added that he “wouldn’t be proud” to have the nation’s largest Somali community, asserting, “Look at their nation. Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just a people walking around killing each other.” Targeting Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Trump called him a “fool,” before turning once again to Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar: “(She is) always talking about the constitution. Go back to your own country and figure out your constitution.” Trump later added: “Somalia is considered by many to be the worst country on Earth — I won’t be there any time soon.” The Minneapolis–St Paul region is home to an estimated 84,000 people of Somali descent, nearly one-third of the entire Somali population in the United States. Their arrival dates back to the 1990s, when refugees fleeing civil conflict resettled in Minnesota, drawn by social support programmes and an expanding diaspora network.

The probe revealed how the 26-year-old spent his last moments and who was with him during that time. In Poorstacy's death case, police arrested Nicole Grikstas on Saturday. It was during interrogation that Nicole broke down and described in detail the events that led up to Milfort's death by handgun. The Don’t Look at Me singer , whose real name is Carlito Milfort, was with his partner, Nicole Grikstas and their young child when he allegedly shot himself with his loaded gun. This happened hours after Milfort and Nicole consumed cocaine on 28 November. As per a TMZ report, a week before Poorstacy's death, the couple checked into a motel located in Florida's Boca Raton. Disregarding their child's presence, the couple allegedly consumed “copious amounts of drugs,” police said. According to the report, the two were using cocaine, MDMA, and Xanax during their stay at the motel. Hours before the tragedy, Nicole Grikstas took a dose of MDMA around 3:00 am on 29 November. Nicole informed police officers that the two not only consumed drugs in front of their child but also fought through the night with each other over infidelity. Despite the tense and volatile environment, Nicole did not move the child to a safer place, police alleged. As a result, Nicole was charged with child neglect after failing to protect the child, the report said. According to Nicole's statement, Milfort accused her of hiding his drugs.

Reactions on X surfaced rapidly, with several users commenting on her look. One post read: “Who believes this shit??? 'trump accounts' - that's got bankruptcy written all over it.

However, there is no verified public documentation or credible reporting indicating that she has had plastic surgery or has spoken publicly about any such treatments. Amid the online discussion about her appearance, the couple’s announcement marked a record-setting moment. Michael and Susan Dell pledged $6.25 billion on GivingTuesday to support 25 million children in the United States aged 10 and under, making it the largest private donation ever directed toward a federal initiative. The contribution expands the “Trump Accounts” programme, which currently provides $1,000 in Treasury-backed investment accounts to children born between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2028.

The cause of death has not yet been disclosed, according to AP . Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, stated Cropper’s family informed her that he died on Wednesday in Nashville. The foundation runs the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, situated on the former Stax Records site where Cropper spent many years working. Eddie Gore, a longtime colleague, said he saw Cropper on Tuesday at a Nashville rehabilitation facility where he was recovering from a recent fall. Gore said Cropper had been working on new music during the visit. “He's such a good human. We were blessed to have him, for sure,\" AP quoted Gore as saying. According to his website, playitsteve.com, Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, later relocating with his family to Memphis at age 9 and receiving his first mail-order guitar when he was 14.

The incident, which produced a dramatic plume of smoke and a sonic boom heard for miles, has prompted a military inquiry into what went wrong. The crash occurred at approximately 10:45 am over controlled military airspace near Trona, California — a remote desert region roughly 200 miles west of the Thunderbirds’ home base at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. According to the Air Force, the F-16C Fighting Falcon went down on a dry lake bed south of Trona Airport, though it was not attempting to land there. Emergency responders said the jet “struck a dry lake bed in the Mojave Desert near Trona, Calif., creating a plume of smoke and a boom that could be heard in the surrounding area.” A video circulating on social media appeared to capture the final moments, showing the aircraft engulfed in flames just as the pilot’s parachute deployed above it. The US Air Force confirmed that the pilot ejected successfully and survived. “The pilot was in stable condition and was receiving medical care,” Staff Sgt. Jovante Johnson said in an email, adding that further updates would follow once assessments were complete. Signs so far suggest the pilot avoided serious harm — an outcome that is not always guaranteed in high-velocity ejections. Investigators have yet to determine the cause.

Calling Biden's policies \"horrible\" and \"ridiculously burdensome\", Trump said, \"My administration is taking historic action to lower costs for American consumers, protect American auto jobs and make buying a car much more affordable for countless American families.\" Trump's announcement from the Oval Office came in the presence of Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley, Stellantis NV CEO Antonio Filosa, and John Urbanic, plant manager at General Motors’ Orion, Michigan, facility. The proposal, if finalised next year, would ease regulatory pressure on automakers to control emissions from gasoline-powered trucks and cars in a reversal from the Biden administration's push towards cleaner-running vehicles. The Biden-era regulations required automakers to achieve a fuel efficiency of 50 miles per gallon across their 2031 model-year vehicles—the aim was to promote both energy efficiency and spur the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). Trump's proposal seeks to lower that requirement to about 34.5 miles per for the 2031 model year, as per Bloomberg . The proposal, if finalised, would come as a major win for the auto and oil industry, which had pushed back against the Biden-era standards, arguing that the administration's demands pushed the limits of available technology. “As America’s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,” Ford CEO Farley said, welcoming the move.

Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who ran an urgent-care clinic near Los Angeles, pleaded guilty in July 2025 to four felony counts of illegal distribution of ketamine . He was not accused of providing the exact dose that killed Perry on October 28, 2023. Prosecutors highlighted that Perry, who had been taking ketamine legally for depression, turned to Plasencia after his regular doctor refused to provide the amounts he wanted. Court filings reveal that Plasencia knew Perry was struggling with addiction and exploited his vulnerability. Plasencia reportedly texted another doctor calling Perry a “moron” who could be exploited for money. The prosecution’s memo stated: “Rather than do what was best for Mr. Perry — someone who had struggled with addiction for most of his life — defendant sought to exploit Perry’s medical vulnerability for profit.” Plasencia’s lawyers painted a sympathetic portrait of the doctor, noting that he had risen out of poverty and was beloved by patients, some of whom submitted testimonials to the court. The defense acknowledged the illegal sale as “reckless” and the biggest mistake of his life: “Remorse cannot begin to capture the pain, regret and shame that Mr. Plasencia feels for the tragedy that unfolded and that he failed to prevent,” the memo said.

He has also been viciously attacked in the media and threatened by strangers to the point where his family has moved out of state for their safety.” Plasencia pleaded guilty to four counts, while prosecutors dropped five others.

The images and videos, taken from Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands, provide a rare look inside Epstein’s notorious Caribbean compound. The Democrats on the Oversight Committee have shared the images and videos on X (formerly Twitter), encouraging the public to “see for yourself” and raising awareness about ongoing investigations into Epstein’s criminal activities .  The visuals reveal several rooms in Epstein ’s luxury retreat, including: -A room resembling a dentist’s operating office, decorated with masks of historical figures. -A shower room stacked with pillows and towels. -Clean and spacious bedrooms. -A blackboard in Epstein’s study with words like “political,” “plots,” “deception,” “power,” “truth,” and “music” scribbled. -A landline phone in the residence showed speed-dial buttons labeled with names including Darren, Rich, Mike, Patrick, and Larry, alongside a New York office, with four other names censored.  Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the committee’s ranking member, called the images “a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island.” He added: “We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes. We won’t stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors.” The committee described the photos as a “harrowing look behind Epstein’s closed doors,” highlighting the luxurious surroundings where Epstein allegedly groomed and abused minors while hosting the world’s elite.

Convoys of tractors blocked routes to North Macedonia, Bulgaria and Turkey forcing drivers into lengthy detours. Over the weekend, hundreds of farmers took to the streets, blocking roads with tractors in several areas. Protests by farmers are common in Greece, but the latest unrest erupted over delays in subsidy payments following revelations of widespread fraudulent claims for EU funds. The scandal prompted the resignation in June of five senior government officials and the phased shutdown of a state agency that handled agricultural subsidies. Michalis Chrisochoidis, a minister for public order, said this week the government remained open to talks with protest leaders but warned that it would not tolerate the shutdown of major transit points, including ports and railway hubs. Dozens of people have been arrested across Greece in recent weeks for allegedly filing false claims, in response to an investigation led by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The independent EU body that deals with financial crime said at the end of October that the investigation was linked to “a systematic large-scale subsidy fraud scheme and money-laundering activities.” Greece's farming sector has been hit this year by the subsidy delays and an outbreak of goat and sheep pox that led to a mass cull of livestock. Protest organizers vowed Wednesday to expand protests, urging the government to speed up an overhaul of agriculture subsidy assessments. “The poorer we get, the more determined we become. There is no turning back.

In a post on X, the State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) described the agreement as “great news” for the growing defence partnership between Washington and New Delhi. The sustainment package, signed by India’s Ministry of Defence, will cover long-term support for the Indian Navy’s 24 MH-60R helicopters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.  The package covers long-term support for 24 MH-60R helicopters that India purchased from the US under a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreement in 2020. The Indian Navy has inducted about 15 aircraft so far. According to the SCA bureau, the deal will strengthen India’s maritime operations by ensuring high mission readiness for the multi-role helicopters, which are used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, search and rescue, and surveillance missions. The support package “will enhance the Indian Navy’s maritime capabilities, build interoperability with the U.S. and regional partners, and make both our nations safer and more prosperous,” the bureau said. The sustainment agreement is part of a broader push by the two countries to expand defence cooperation, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. The helicopters are intended to upgrade the Navy’s rotary-wing fleet and bolster surveillance and submarine-hunting capabilities amid rising activity in the Indian Ocean. The US has emphasised that long-term sustainment agreements such as this one improve joint operational capability between the Indian Navy and US forces. Officials said the new sustainment contract will significantly increase helicopter availability and reduce maintenance time—factors critical for maritime operations in the Indian Ocean region.

This marked the first such attempt by a Chinese firm, as the country’s expanding commercial space sector seeks to compete with American companies like SpaceX, according to a report by CNN. The Beijing-based company successfully launched its Zhuque-3 rocket from a remote desert site in northwestern China. The rocket reached orbit as intended, but its first stage, the part that provides initial thrust, did not land successfully and instead crashed to the ground, the report said, citing the company. “An anomaly occurred after the first-stage engine ignited during the landing phase, preventing a soft landing on the designated recovery pad,\" the company was quoted as saying. “The debris landed at the edge of the recovery area, resulting in a failed recovery test.” The company said it would conduct a comprehensive review and continue to “advance the verification and application of reusable rocket technology in future missions,” the statement added. Watch video here —  Despite the current attempt being unsuccessful, the trial has positioned the company at the forefront of a group of Chinese firms competing to develop reusable rocket technology that Beijing hopes will boost its rivalry with international competitors. Reusable rockets are viewed as crucial because the technology can notably reduce the cost and turnaround time of rocket launches, a clear advantage as global companies compete to expand satellite networks and plan for a future space travel industry.

While federal officials insist the sweeps target violent offenders. A federal immigration crackdown began in New Orleans, with Homeland Security officials confirming the operation will focus on violent offenders. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the aim is to apprehend immigrants previously arrested for “home invasion, armed robbery and rape.” “These sweeps,” she said, “are targeting criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets.” The New Orleans operation expands the Trump administration’s mass deportation strategy already launched in cities such as Chicago and Charlotte , North Carolina. Another sweep is expected in Minnesota, targeting Somali immigrants. Since January, federal agents have conducted raids in both large and small communities. Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a strong Trump ally, has been preparing for weeks. He said the operation will go after the “worst of the worst, criminal illegal aliens that have broken the law.” “It started today,” Landry said in a radio interview, “and it’s going to run until we get them all off the street.” The deployment comes amid ongoing tension in New Orleans over immigration, despite the city’s reliance on thousands of Latino workers in the years after Hurricane Katrina. Federal officials have repeatedly criticized New Orleans for what they describe as sanctuary-style policies. McLaughlin argued: “Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens.” Attorney General Pam Bondi also accused the city of undermining enforcement.

The development comes as IndiGo faced mass cancellations and delays across multiple airports on Wednesday, December 3. The data further showed that 92 of the 1,232 flights were cancelled due to the air traffic control (ATC) system failure, while 258 flights were cancelled due to airport or airspace-related restrictions. The remaining 127 flights were cancelled due to other reasons. “A large share of cancellations arose from crew/FDTL compliance and airport/airspace/ATC-related factors, many of which lie beyond the operator's direct control,” according to the Ministry of Civil Aviation statement, citing IndiGo. IndiGo's on-time performance (OTP) for November 2025 stood at 67.70%, compared to its previous level of 84.1% in October 2025.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality.

Whether you’re heading to Europe, Asia, or anywhere in between, living and learning in a new culture offers you the chance to build skills that last a lifetime. So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success. Naturally, studying abroad improves language skills —especially if you’re living in a country where a different language is spoken", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/what-skills-do-you-gain-from-studying-abroad/", "timestamp": 1764826514.6697679}
