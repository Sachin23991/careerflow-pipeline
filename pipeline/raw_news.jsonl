My mother, now retired, always pushed me to study seriously, while my father, an international truck driver who travelled across Africa, showed me what dedication and resilience look like. Watching him cross borders for work made me believe early on that the world is bigger than where you are born—and that education could be my passport to explore it. That mindset is what led me to India. Right after my secondary school, I received admission to Marwadi University in Rajkot, Gujarat, through the Study in India scheme. The programme was meant to strengthen international relations and bring students like me to Indian campuses. The scholarship covered my tuition fees, food, and accommodation, though not my stipend, visa, or travel. I had to take the very first Ind-SAT exam in 2020—conducted across more than 50 countries—to qualify. When the results arrived, I felt genuinely privileged. That scholarship changed the direction of my life. At Marwadi University, I completed my BTech, and by the time I graduated, I knew I wanted to pursue a more specialised path – something that would allow me to contribute to Zambia’s infrastructure development in the future. Construction Technology and Management was the perfect match, and one name kept coming up whenever I discussed my dreams with mentors: IIT Bombay . So I applied through the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarship scheme. For international students, ICCR manages the entire admission process. There is no Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) or Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) requirement; selection is merit-based, depending on academic record and overall competence. My preparation therefore was straightforward but demanding: keep my grades strong and present my achievements clearly. The toughest part wasn’t the academics—it was waiting.

The section on the Ghaznavid invasions is preceded by a box that contains “a word of caution”. The box is similar to the “note on history’s darker periods”, which was published in the class 8 textbook, placed before the chapter on the Delhi Sultanate. The box in the class 7 textbook refers to this note and states that it explains how history has recorded war, conquest and destruction more than peace, good governance or creativity, and how the world over historians have sometimes hesitated to draw attention to such darker periods. “Our approach is that it is better to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. In addition, we should not forget that while past events cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone responsible for them today,” it reads. The new textbook is meant for use in the ongoing academic session. Part 1 of the textbook was released earlier this year. The old NCERT class 7 history textbook had a paragraph on the Mahmud of Ghazni. It pointed out that rulers tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples, and chose to target temples which were sometimes extremely rich when they attacked kingdoms. It referred to the Mahmud of Ghazni as having raided the subcontinent 17 times with a religious motive, targeting wealthy temples and taking away their wealth. ‘The Ghaznavid Invasions’ section has about six pages including boxes and pictures.

The institute has also reiterated conditions related to age, number of attempts and Class XII qualification. This year, the examination will be held on May 17, Sunday. Under Criterion A1, candidates must be among the top 2,50,000 performers in JEE Main 2026 (BE/BTech paper).

IIT Roorkee has also noted that OCI/PIO (I) candidates are not eligible for any reserved category benefits, except under OPEN-PwD if applicable. They must qualify strictly in the OPEN lists. To be eligible, candidates must have been born on or after October 1, 2001. A relaxation of five years applies to SC, ST and PwD candidates, meaning they should have been born on or after October 1, 1996.

In a first, the Ministry has shared a total of 6,28,305 (6.28 lakh) are enrolled at the school-level.

Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank. Also Read | IIT Delhi BTech Placement Trends: Top-packages, companies Tests vary in difficulty with each session (so scores are not the same). Two students who score differently on the same exam can have the same percentile and therefore the same rank.

Therefore, the percentile will always be viewed as the best benchmark for determining a good score on the JEE Main examination. Also Read| Is NCERT enough for preparation?

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers. But the rise of IIT Bombay was also inseparable from the city that housed it, a city whose own history of names reflects centuries of shifting rule, culture, and political imagination.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said. The government is also working to finalise a transparent transfer policy, he said. “A government doctor (MBBS) is required to serve three years in a rural hospital to get a chance to pursue MD or MS.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer?

The company was already facing criticism over the event. And now it might escalate thanks to new video. The NYT tracked down surveillance video that shows a woman crouching beside the Waymo trying to lure KitKat to safety before the vehicle suddenly pulled away.

In response, the company said it was only testing ways to show apps built on the ChatGPT app platform that it announced in October , with “no financial component” to those suggestions.

Lose all your users. pic.twitter.com/2Z5AG8pnlJ Similarly, ChatGPT head Nick Turley posted Friday that he was “seeing lots of confusion about ads rumors in ChatGPT.” “There are no live tests for ads – any screenshots you’ve seen are either not real or not ads,” Turley wrote. “If we do pursue ads, we’ll take a thoughtful approach. People trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.” Earlier that same day, however, Chen responded in a more apologetic tone, acknowledging that the controversy isn’t just a matter of user confusion. “I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,” he wrote. “We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision. We’re also looking at better controls so you can dial this down or off if you don’t find it helpful.” Earlier this year, former Instacart and Facebook executive Fidji Sumo joined OpenAI as CEO of Applications and was widely expected to build up the company’s advertising business .

Now a general partner at venture firm Playground Global, he’s working with 10 startups. But one portfolio company has captured an outsized share of his attention: xLight , a semiconductor startup that last Monday announced it has struck a preliminary deal for up to $150 million from the U.S. Commerce Department, with the government set to become a meaningful shareholder. It’s a nice feather in the cap of Gelsinger, who spent 35 years across two stints at Intel before the board showed him the door late last year owing to a lack of confidence in his turnaround plans. But the xLight deal is also shining a spotlight on a trend that’s making people in Silicon Valley quietly uncomfortable: the Trump administration taking equity stakes in strategically important companies. “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” California Governor Gavin Newsom asked at a speaking event this week, capturing the unease that’s rippling through an industry that has long prided itself on its free-market principles. Speaking at one of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC events at Playground Global, Gelsinger — who is xLight’s executive chairman — seemed unbothered by the philosophical debate. He’s more focused on his bet that xLight can solve what he sees as the semiconductor industry’s biggest bottleneck: lithography, the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize chip manufacturing. If the technology works at scale, that is. “You know, I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said, referencing the decades-old principle that computing power should double every two years. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.” The xLight de", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/pat-gelsinger-wants-to-save-moores-law-with-a-little-help-from-the-feds/", "timestamp": 1765166610.3819838}

At least, that seems to be the case with companies like Airtable, Handshake, and Opendoor, which all announced in recent months that they are “refounding.” As reported in The New York Times these announcements are usually tied to new business models or the launch of new AI products. For example, Airtable said in June that “instead of just adding more A.I. capabilities to our existing platform, we treated this as a refounding moment for the company. The startup’s co-founder and CEO Howie Liu told the NYT that this is not a pivot because it’s not about changing direction after getting something wrong. Liu said the company considered calling it a relaunch or transformation, but ultimately chose “the language of founding because the stakes feel the same.” Similarly, Handshake’s chief marketing officer Katherine Kelly said the company is trying to bring startup culture “back into an existing business.” That can also mean harder work — Kelly said handshake told employees they have to be back in the office five days a week, “operating with a pace and number of hours that is meaningful and will help us hit goals.” Topics Show your CFO the marketing proof they want!

Some of the firmest opposition has come from the Writers Guild of America, which issued a statement declaring, “This merger must be blocked.” “The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the WGA said. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.” While statements from other Hollywood unions were not quite as unequivocal, they still suggested that there are “many serious questions” about the acquisition’s “impact on the future of the entertainment industry” (as the actors union SAG-AFTRA put it ). The deal came after a competitive process in which Paramount and Comcast also made bids. Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division. Initially, Paramount was seen as the frontrunner , with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner. This deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2026, would presumably face significant regulatory scrutiny , and not just from Trump appointees.

It has gained immense popularity over the years, and as a result, many companies have seized the opportunity to create similar year-in-review experiences, offering users a recap of their habits, preferences, or interactions from the past year. Here are some platforms and websites that mimic the Spotify Wrapped concept. Amazon Music has a new Spotify Wrapped knockoff this year called “ 2025 Delivered ,” which offers a summary of users’ listening stats, such as top artists, songs, and even podcasts. Notably, the platform also takes advantage of Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, by giving users a special message from their favorite artist. The feature can be found on the app by tapping on the Library tab. This year’s update features new badges for listeners to showcase. For instance, the “Trendsetter” badge is given to those who listened to trending albums early, while the “Headliner” badge honors fans who rank among the top percentage of an artist’s listeners. There are also new shareable cards designed with a “music festival” theme, tailored specifically for each listener. Previously, Amazon Music’s equivalent of Spotify Wrapped was “My Year in Review,” a playlist featuring 50 to 100 of the most popular tracks based on your yearly statistics. The playlist is available in the “Playlists” section or “Made For You.” Apple’s music streaming service Apple Music first rolled out its “ Replay ” experience in 2019. The feature offers a summary of top songs, artists, albums, genres, playlists, and stations, including play counts, total time spent listening, and other insights. You can also share personalized listening data on social media, and a year-end highlight reel offers an audio and visual recap of the music you listened to the most throughout the year.

The valuation increase follows Yoodli’s $40 million Series B round, led by WestBridge Capital with participation from Neotribe and Madrona. It comes after a $13.7 million Series A round announced in May, bringing the startup’s total funding to nearly $60 million. As AI tools spread into workplaces and fuel fears of automation, Yoodli positions itself differently. The four-year-old, Seattle-based startup uses AI to run simulated scenarios — including sales calls, leadership coaching, interviews, and feedback sessions — and provides users with structured, repeatable practice to improve their speaking skills. Varun Puri (pictured above, right), who previously worked at Google’s X division and handled special projects for Sergey Brin, co-founded Yoodli with former Apple engineer Esha Joshi (pictured above, left) in 2021. He became aware of communication challenges after moving to the U.S. at 18 and seeing how difficulty expressing ideas or speaking confidently affected students and young professionals from countries such as India — himself included — Puri said in an interview. Initially, Yoodli was meant to help people practice public speaking — a skill two out of three people struggle with, Puri told TechCrunch, citing internal data. However, the startup soon saw users turning to the platform for interview preparation, sales pitches, and difficult conversations.

The voluntary software recall will be filed early next week, according to the company. Waymo said as soon as the issue was identified it updated its software on November 17. The company contends this update has meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this important area. Software recalls have become more common in the age of modern passenger vehicles — and now robotaxis — in which operations are handled by software. These updates, or fixes, are often made prior to the official recall but still carry weight when filed with the federal government. Waymo’s decision follows increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism by officials in Atlanta and Austin over how its robotaxis perform around school buses. NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into Waymo in October after seeing footage of its autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. Other similar incidents popped up in Austin, where the company also operates a robotaxi service with partner Uber. Austin School District officials contend, in a letter available on NHTSA’s website, that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software. The agency sent a letter December 3 to Waymo asking for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year.

NHTSA said in the letter it has received 62 complaints from Tesla drivers, 14 reports submitted by Tesla, and four media reports that describe potential violations. That’s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it opened an investigation into the behavior in October. The federal safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla’s driver assistance software can “accurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,” according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla’s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla’s responses are due January 19, 2026. The increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection.” The agency didn’t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts its own submissions to the agency.

A few years earlier, he had lost 40 pounds with the help of an Apple Watch, which counted steps and tracked his calorie burn, and he began wondering if there was a similar device to assess his stress. “I wanted to lose 40 pounds of stress, and realized there’s no wearable for that today,” Forenza told TechCrunch. That’s when Forenza realized he’d stumbled onto a gap in the consumer health market. Drawing on his engineering background, he decided to build the device himself, using a more than century-old technology: the electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain. While EEG is used clinically to diagnose diseases such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, it can also detect psychological stress by measuring high-frequency brain waves called beta waves. When those rapid beta waves persist for extended periods, they can lead to exhaustion, insomnia, and mental distress. Forenza collaborated with data scientists and biomedical engineers to develop Awear , a small device worn behind the ear for continuous brainwave monitoring. The device transmits results to an app, which provides information about the wearer’s mood and offers AI-powered coaching advice for managing stress and improving emotional resilience. “Our brain is phenomenal at self-adjusting and makes us believe we are not stressed,” Forenza said. “It’s fine to be in ‘fight or flight’ every once in a while.

Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’ desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record.

Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too. “When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many.

We now have running shoes tailored to every type of run: daily trainers, carbon racers, easy-day recovery shoes, speed session super trainers, tempo shoes. Trail running isn’t immune to the endless subcategories, and the newest niche is gravel shoes—a subset of trail running shoes designed specifically for mixed-terrain runs across compacted gravel paths, forest roads, hard-pack trails, and regular old roads. But are the brands just repackaging trail running shoes with smaller lugs? Or do gravel shoes genuinely offer something new and different?

Salomon REI (Men's) REI (Women's) Backcountry (Men's) Backcountry (Women's) If you’re recently been scouting for the best running shoes for trail, chances are you’ll have stumbled across gravel shoes. You’d be forgiven for wondering what they are. Gravel running shoes are basically hybrid running shoes built to handle multiterrain runs. They’re designed to let you run off-road—just not too far off the beaten track and certainly not onto the trickiest mountain slopes. The big selling point: They’re versatile enough to cruise compacted gravel (of course), forest tracks, hard-packed park and river paths, light uneven trails, and even the road commute to get there. “Gravel is a fairly new category,” says Taylor Bodin, chief trail shoe tester for Believe in the Run . “It is meant to be versatile in the sense that it can traverse lighter terrain more efficiently. This could mean anything from a door-to-trail shoe to a light trail shoe.” Gravel shoes blend the technologies and design of road and trail, mixing some of the cushion, impact pr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-gravel-running-shoes/", "timestamp": 1765166618.6838338}

Players walk clockwise in a circle. When the music stops, everyone sits in a chair. Big Tech is setting in motion its plans for the next gen of lead designers, engineers, AI chiefs, and even CEOs. In Cupertino, Apple execs with familiar faces are retiring or reducing responsibilities. Who’s in and who’s out? Well, chief operating officer Jeff Williams retired in November, and the speculation is that CEO Tim Cook could follow in the near term. Lisa Jackson, who has led Apple’s sustainability efforts since 2013, is now set to retire in January too. There’s also the squad of Apple staffers who have been lured away to work with OpenAI , notably Apple’s former chief design officer Jony Ive after his independent stint at LoveFrom . In 2024, Molly Anderson was named industrial design leader, heading up a team of mostly fresh faces. Others have gone to Meta, such as Apple’s VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, who just this week was poached to head up a new Reality Labs design studio. At Apple, he’s been replaced by long-time UI designer Stephen Lemay. Phew. In this swirl of shifting talent, John Ternus, who has worked for Apple since 2001, and served as SVP of hardware engineering for the last four years, reporting directly to Tim Cook, is emerging as the frontrunner to succeed Cook as Apple CEO, reportedly as soon as next year. WIRED asked Apple for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. Alongside a steady drip of “leaks” on succession planning and Ternus’ position at the front of the pack, since 2023, Ternus has been given more prominence at product launch events. He announced the iPhone Air onstage this past September, and has appeared alongside other senior Apple leaders in press interviews and in-store Apple events. “I think they're testing to see what sentiment is like.

Here’s a test for infants: Show them a glass of water on a desk. Hide it behind a wooden board. Now move the board toward the glass. If the board keeps going past the glass, as if it weren’t there, are they surprised? Many 6-month-olds are, and by a year, almost all children have an intuitive notion of an object’s permanence, learned through observation. Now some artificial intelligence models do too. Researchers have developed an AI system that learns about the world via videos and demonstrates a notion of “surprise” when presented with information that goes against the knowledge it has gleaned. The model, created by Meta and called Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), does not make any assumptions about the physics of the world contained in the videos. Nonetheless, it can begin to make sense of how the world works. “Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting,” says Micha Heilbron , a cognitive scientist at the University of Amsterdam who studies how brains and artificial systems make sense of the world. As the engineers who build self-driving cars know, it can be hard to get an AI system to reliably make sense of what it sees. Most systems designed to “understand” videos in order to either classify their content (“a person playing tennis,” for example) or identify the contours of an object—say, a car up ahead—work in what’s called “pixel space.” The model essentially treats every pixel in a video as equal in importance. But these pixel-space models come with limitations. Imagine trying to make sense of a suburban street. If the scene has cars, traffic lights and trees, the model might focus too much on irrelevant details such as the motion of the leaves. It might miss the color of the traffic light, or the positions of nearby cars. “When you go to images or video, you don’t want to work in [pixel] space because there are too many details you d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-one-ai-model-creates-a-physical-intuition-of-its-environment/", "timestamp": 1765166618.976558}

Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider ) had \"Norwegian kaiju\" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating \"Megatroll\" it has locked away. Soon, Nora—reunited with allies Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Major Kris Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen)—is caught in another desperate race to prevent a trollpocalypse. This time though, there's an edge of Indiana Jones at work, with a madcap ancient conspiracy to decode alongside the troll-smashing action.

You could take all of your games with you, install mods and custom software, or even plug into a hub and get some work done. Lenovo is taking another swing at the Windows handheld game with the Legion Go 2, undeterred by mixed reviews on the original Legion Go and streamlined Legion Go S . But even a snappier interface and versatile input methods can’t overcome a lot of the barriers inherent to running Windows on a device with no keyboard. If you’re willing to put in the work, or you already love your original Legion Go, the performance, screen, and software support have all improved. If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I’d recommend picking something a little lower maintenance. I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand. Lenovo Go Gen 2 Rating: 7/10 Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings. It’s unique, and the easy access to a mouse and right-click without using the touchpad is a nice bonus, but the way you grip the controller means you're always kind of palming the joystick on the side. I play a lot of mouse-dependent games like World of Warcraft, and I find it more useful for patching holes where controller buttons don't cover niche situations, or briefly switching to do inventory man", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/lenovo-legion-go-gen-2/", "timestamp": 1765166619.3822107}

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain . By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity . The present crisis reflects not only this summer’s extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry. The drought quickly disrupted Tehran’s urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank . Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation , and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved . These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran’s infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress. These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer.

Putting a camera-enabled digital device in your toilet that uploads an analysis of your actual bodily waste to a corporation represents such a laughably bad idea that, 11 years ago, it was the subject of a parody infomercial . In 2025, it’s an actual product—and one whose privacy problems, despite the marketing copy of the company behind it, have turned out to be exactly as bad as any normal human might have imagined. Security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler this week published a blog post revealing that the Dekota, a camera-packing smart device sold by Kohler, does not in fact use “end-to-end encryption” as it claimed. That term typically means that data is encrypted so that only user devices on either “end” of a conversation can decrypt the information therein, not the server that sits in between them and hosts that encrypted communication.

Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept —a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell. British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing. Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new . Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn’t until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings. Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet Rating: 9/10 RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila! The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company’s name, RLS, or “Relea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/canyon-deflectr-rls-bike-helmet/", "timestamp": 1765166619.7374673}

The lowest tier contains cheap machines one would buy as a housewarming present for a friend or relative’s third or fourth property, like a timeshare in the country or a freshly christened yacht. The second-lowest is a mandatory gift for someone you don’t know well or care for very much, such as the wedding of a distant cousin or former nemesis. The third tier is a gift for someone you know and like, and the fourth is a treat yo’ self gift you bestow upon yourself after finishing a large project, landing a promotion at work, or finally turning a profit at your bespoke AI-powered marketing and SEO agency. Gevi’s imaginatively named Espresso Machine lands at the high end of the second tier. This single-boiler, 15-bar machine performs essential functions like grinding coffee, pulling shots, and steaming milk at a level that’s acceptable for its cost. The mostly plastic chassis won’t impress most normal folks, but the lack of gauges, digital menus, and other customization options might actually excite the type of gruff Philistine who screams “BLACK COFFEE” at the barista before they can get a word in edgewise whenever they walk into a third-wave cafe. You might as well just stay home with that attitude, in which case, all the Americanos with none of the hassle of talking to humans are available right in your own kitchen. The machine is easy to assemble and comes with a small handful of chintzy accessories you’ll want to replace immediately, first among them being the glossy plastic tamper that only weighs about 80 grams—one-fifth the weight of the tamper that is included with the Casabrews 5700PRO .

But Horses fails to meet the lofty goals of its own ideas.", "content": "Shortly before the December 2 release of horror game Horses , developer Santa Ragione shared some news: The game would not be available on Valve’s mega platform, Steam . Valve had already banned an early, incomplete version of the game two years ago and offered, according to Santa Ragione , little clarification about why at the time. Then, hours before the game’s release, the Epic Games Store banned Horses as well. A day after the game’s launch, distribution platform Humble removed, and then later relisted, the title. The public swiftly spoke out against these bans, and community support for the game’s developers has been plentiful. Many pieces have been written online about how the game doesn’t deserve to be shunned by the distribution platforms, and about how the game’s content is relatively tame . But too few of these pieces engage with the content of the game on a critical level. Horses ’ storytelling is clumsy, and its blasé treatment of the sexual assaults (plural!) depicted in the game fails to elevate the game beyond more than a lazy commentary of sexual repression. It’s difficult to untangle the circumstances and controversy surrounding the game’s release from the content of the game itself. As a writer, I think censorship of creative work is Bad. I think Horses has as much right to exist as any other game, and that the power of distribution platforms to ban and delist a game by a small studio should be a concern for everyone. But the real problem with Horses is not that it’s too audacious for what is clearly intended to be an adult audience. Horses , for all the attention around its banning, is tedious and overreliant on pseudo-intellectual ideas. It confuses its own pretension for something profound. Even its shock value eventually wears off, making its three-hour run time feel like a slog. Conversations about whether or not it deserves the scandal are ultimately useless and wholly subjective.

Sure, it’s easy to rattle off some killer titles— KPop Demon Hunters , Stranger Things —but Netflix has never really had a brand identity. It’s not, like Disney , the home of Star Wars and Mickey Mouse. As streaming services go, it’s made its name by being a jack of all trades and a master of none. Now, it’s made its smartest move yet, dropping $83 billion to buy itself a whole new personality. On Friday, the streaming giant announced it will be acquiring Warner Bros. in a deal that gives Netflix the studio’s film and television operations as well as HBO and HBO Max. For those who can’t keep up with who owns what these days—no one can—that means that once the deal closes, Netflix will own everything from Batman to The Big Bang Theory , The Wizard of Oz to Westeros . Also, Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter , and prestige TV shows like The Sopranos. According to Paul Erickson, a media and entertainment analyst at Omdia, acquiring content with that kind of name recognition will allow Netflix to attract and retain subscribers. “It will also increase Netflix’s standing within the industry from talent, recruitment, and salary negotiation perspectives,” he added. The deal, which is expected to close next fall after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable business (CNN, HGTV, Discovery, and others), surprised the hell out of Hollywood when Netflix announced it Friday morning. Warner Bros. Discovery’s future had been hanging in the balance for weeks, with a series of potential buyers putting in offers. NBCUniversal parent company Comcast made a bid.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

Some of it is entirely AI-generated, while other users have taken to editing their posts and comments with AI programs like Grammarly. “It’s probably more prevalent than anybody wants to really admit, because it’s just so easy to shove your post into ChatGPT and say ‘Hey, make this more exciting,’” says Cassie, who thinks as much as half of all content being posted to Reddit may have been created or reworked with AI in some way. r/AmItheAsshole is a pillar of Reddit culture, a format that has inspired dozens if not hundreds of derivatives like r/AmIOverreacting, r/AmITheDevil, and r/AmItheKameena, a subreddit with over 100,000 members described as “Am I the asshole, but the Indian version.” Posts tend to feature stories about interpersonal conflicts, where Redditors can weigh in on who is wrong (“YTA” means “You’re the asshole,” while “ESH” means “Everyone sucks here”), who is right, and what the best course of action to take is moving forward.

(2025)", "summary": "Optimize your sauna session by listening to the experts and, more importantly, your body.", "content": "Whether it’s post-workout or as part of a spa day, a sauna session can relax and enhance wellness. The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1765166621.5230646}

The “overwhelming majority” of the images involved nudity and were “depicted adult content,” according to the researcher who uncovered the exposed trove of data, with some appearing to depict children or the faces of children swapped onto the AI-generated bodies of nude adults. Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos.

As a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2 , both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance , the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm. But because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you.

The outside general counsel for USIP, he’s been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump’s right to remove them from office.

Boomers, Hogg said, are likely the group most out of touch with their generation in Washington, DC. “You know why I say that?” Hogg said. “It's because the people that are marching by the millions right now in the No Kings Day protests are not young people. They are people of Chuck Schumer's generation that are extremely pissed off with him.” Hogg’s Schumer slams weren’t the only anti-boomer jabs he threw during his talk, likening the current makeup of Congress to the “end of the Soviet Union” when he said “leaders were dying over and over because they were so old,” and complaining about the establishment leadership in the Democratic National Committee , where Hogg was vice chair until a recent shake-up. While Hogg did concede that “there are plenty of great boomers out there,” he said part of what he’s working on as the cofounder of the group Leaders We Deserve is a shift in elected officials’ age and political focus. “What we want to do with Leaders We Deserve is not just elect younger versions of who's already there,” said Hogg. “We want to elect younger people that have the chance to actually have integrity, support them with millions of dollars, ensure that they don't take money from corporations, for example, [and ask] th", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-david-hogg/", "timestamp": 1765166622.5763009}

Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs.

Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should. Lavingia was previously assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), where he was part of a group of technologists brought into the government in the early months of DOGE’s takeover.

Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work. At the VA, Lavignia attempted to use an AI tool to write code for the agency’s systems and suggested the agency move away from paper forms entirely.

The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday. The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command’s classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.” The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate , because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security .

At WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday—not so coincidentally held in San Francisco—the mayor told global editorial director Katie Drummond that he’s absolutely convinced that anyone looking to rag on the city doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Of course, Lurie said, things could always be better. While he hailed positive changes that San Francisco has made since he took office 11 months ago, like more office space being filled in the downtown area and a decrease in crime, he acknowledged that some of that might have come in the wake of companies’ return-to-office policies and the AI boom. Still, Lurie said, if you ask San Francisco residents, 62 percent say that their city is headed in the right direction, compared to just 25 percent a year ago. Lurie said part of what’s going to help keep San Francisco on the right track is a commitment from residents. Past leaders, he said, “took San Francisco for granted,” thinking “we could just continue on, and our success would continue as well.” To make San Francisco resilient, able to weather economic changes and tech booms and busts, Lurie said, its leaders have to be “relentless in fighting for [their] city, standing up for [their] city, and welcoming people, saying, ‘We want you here, and we're going to create the conditions for your success.’” But while San Francisco is often cited as a city for the ultra-rich—like the tech CEOs who have lobbied for the city in Washington and like the mayor himself, who has a connection to the Levi Strauss fortune—Lurie said he wants to push toward making his city more affordable, stressing that he wants kids who are born in San Francisco today to be able to live comfortably in the city for the rest of their lives.

But prices won’t drop for years, and consumers will spend more on gas in the meantime.", "content": "The Trump administration says its proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, announced officially in the Oval Office on Wednesday, is an attempt to shave dollars off the ballooning cost of new cars in the US. But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change. The Biden administration took a carrot-and-stick approach to vehicles and their effect on the environment. Light-duty cars and trucks alone are responsible for some 15 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The previous administration tried to boost electric vehicle adoption by using tax subsidies for consumers and manufacturers interested in building fuel-efficient vehicles and technologies, including batteries. It also introduced penalties for those unable or unwilling to meet stricter environmental standards. Automakers should be able to hit next decade’s goals by selling more electric vehicles, the government then reasoned.

That’s when women are supposed to start getting mammograms and men are supposed to start paying a bit more attention to their prostates. Over the next decade, you’ll start getting colonoscopies, and from then on out, it feels like a gradual march of doctor’s appointments and tests until your body collapses sometime in your seventies or eighties. But what if modern medicine has the timeline all wrong? What if we’re testing some middle-aged people unnecessarily for diseases they’ll most likely never get, while blindly ignoring twentysomethings who might be prone to colon cancer? Is there a way that, even as we age, we can stay healthy in a way that’s both meaningful and not reliant on taking 12 horse-sized pills every morning? Eric Topol certainly thinks so. The cardiologist, vice president of Scripps Research, and author of Super Agers is convinced that new innovations in AI-assisted medicine, bioengineering, and anti-inflammatory awareness could have potential to revolutionize the way people age. During WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday, Topol told features editor Sandra Upson that while he was working on Super Agers he learned that there’s a difference between lifespan and health span and that neither has much to do with genetics. Someone who’s “wellderly,” or over 65 and generally healthy, has pretty much the same genetic makeup as someone who’s elderly and facing major health challenges, like heart disease, cancer, or a neurodegenerative disorder. Instead, Topol said, there appears to be a correlation between having a healthy immune system and aging healthily.

The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically.

It might seem shocking to see a crash-test dummy flying through a car window in a video, but learning that an automaker updated their vehicle’s safety features as a result of that test could sell a buyer on a car. Amodei said the same goes for companies using Anthropic’s AI products, making for a market that is somewhat self-regulating. “We’re setting what you can almost think of as minimum safety standards just by what we’re putting into the economy,” she said.

Chu . At WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco, the onetime YouTuber and Crazy Rich Asians director said that working with acts like Justin Bieber taught him the value of connecting with fans online during the creation process. While directing Bieber’s concert film, Never Say Never , in the late aughts, Chu said the then-14-year-old star used Twitter to introduce Chu to fans. After Bieber posted a clip joking that the director was following him around on set, Chu told WIRED’s senior culture editor, Manisha Krishnan, he began to watch his online followers grow by tens of thousands of people almost instantly, something that really drove home the power of direct connection with a fan base. Working with Bieber, Chu said, made him realize that “the story is being told before you even start shooting, and after you’re done with the movie, you have to continue that story.” That’s why he believes fans have felt so invested in Wicked —and its sequel, Wicked: For Good —and why the movie’s marketing and press tours have leaned so heavily on the relationships built by the cast while filming. Bonds, like the one between stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, came from the immense pressure the crew felt to make something not only great but also bankable. “We only had each other, so we’re very, very bonded,” Chu said, likening the relationship to that of Silicon Valley developers working long hours together to deliver a new product. A Bay Area native, Chu said he has always felt partially indebted to the tech world for his start in entertainment. In the ’90s, when Chu was just a teenager, tech-minded customers at his parents’ Chinese restaurant would slip him computers, video cards, and software when they heard he was interested in filmmaking, giving him a leg up on fellow students when he went to college at the University of Southern California. “I was built by the gen", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-jon-chu-wicked/", "timestamp": 1765166624.0920825}

Authorities identified the man as Brian J. Cole Jr., a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. The arrest marks a major break in a case that has vexed authorities for nearly five years. Cole, 30, is charged with transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, intimidate, or destroy property and with attempting to damage and destroy the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees by means of an explosive device. If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison. According to an affidavit , investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Cole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day. Senior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it. “Though it had been nearly five ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/", "timestamp": 1765166624.4174347}

Today, when Su took the stage at WIRED’s Big Interview conference in San Francisco, she had something else in her sights: the AI bubble . When asked by WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode if the tech industry is in an AI bubble, her response was “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” The AI industry is going to need scores of chips from companies like AMD, and fears of such a bubble, Su said, are “somewhat overstated.” That might sound bold, but boldness is Su’s whole deal.

Now, Su is betting big on the need for much more computing power for AI, and the data centers needed to provide that. Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead for AMD. One is all of those data centers being built, and another is getting its chips out into the hands of as many customers as possible. During the discussion, Goode asked the AMD CEO about selling chips to China.

If your phone’s not magnetic, the product ships with an adhesive magnetic ring that you can apply to your device. The T10 contains a processor that powers a GPT-4.1 -trained language model and supports over 150 languages, although the number is inflated as many are minor regional variants of common languages like Spanish and English. The device is self-contained, but it must connect via Bluetooth to your phone (and from there to the internet) for most of the heavy lifting. In fact, while the system touts an offline mode, the company says it won’t be activated until sometime in December. For now, the T10 can’t do anything if you don’t have an active internet connection. InnAIO AI Translator T10 Rating: 5/10 While the T10 hardware is simple, the InnAIO Pro app is anything but. The software includes seven major sections, each providing a different type of translation function. Perhaps the most obvious is Real-Time Translation, which offers a running two-way text translation between ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/innaio-t10-ai-translator/", "timestamp": 1765166624.8863404}

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating. But remaining businesses (Value Retail + Ethnic + D2C + Luxury) will need investments in the near term. We remain conservative and retain REDUCE on ABFRL; we will watch for margin gains in the remnant entity before turning constructive on the stock.

Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier). We revise the rating to REDUCE (from SELL earlier) as the stock has reduced >7% over last month and we see limited downside from hereon.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The US plan has been through several drafts since it first emerged last month, amid criticism it was too soft on Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump has had a hot-and-cold relationship with Zelensky since riding into a second White House term, insisting that the war was a waste of US taxpayer money. Trump also repeatedly urged the Ukrainians to cede land to Russia to bring an end to a now nearly four-year conflict he says has cost far too many lives. Zelensky said Saturday he had a “substantive phone call” with the American officials engaged in the talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida. He said he had been given an update over the phone by US and Ukrainian officials at the talks. “Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,” Zelensky wrote on social media.

Tensions have simmered since Thailand last month suspended de-escalation measures after a Thai soldier was maimed in the latest in a succession of incidents involving landmines that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia. Cambodia rejects the allegations. BUDGETS AND GROUND PERSONNEL Cambodia had a defence budget of $1.3 billion in 2024 and 124,300 active military personnel. The armed forces were established in 1993 from the merger of the country's former Communist military and two other resistance armies. Of this, the Cambodian army is the largest force, with some 75,000 soldiers, backed by more than 200 battle tanks and around 480 pieces of artillery. Thailand, which the U.S. classifies as a major non-NATO ally, has a large, well-funded military, with a defence budget of $5.73 billion in 2024 and over 360,000 active armed forces personnel. The Thai army has a total of 245,000 personnel, including an estimated 115,000 conscripts, around 400 battle tanks, over 1,200 armoured personnel carriers and some 2,600 artillery weapons. The army has its own fleet of aircraft, comprising passenger planes, helicopters such as dozens of U.S.-made Black Hawks, and unmanned aerial vehicles. AIR FORCES Cambodia's air force has 1,500 personnel, with a relatively small fleet of aircraft, including 10 transport planes and 10 transport helicopters. It doesn't possess any fighter aircraft but has 16 multi-role helicopters, including six Soviet-era Mi-17s and 10 Chinese Z-9s. Thailand has one of the best equipped and trained air forces in Southeast Asia, with an estimated 46,000 personnel, 112 combat capable aircraft, including 28 F-16s and 11 Swedish Gripen fighter jets, and dozens of helicopters.

The tragic incident reportedly occurred on 26 November almost a month after daring jewellery heist in which Napoleonic jewellery worth $102 million was stolen in broad daylight. The museum’s deputy general manager Francis Steinbock elaborated on the extent of damage and informed that periodicals and archaeological revues dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were damaged. As per The Guardian report, between 300 and 400 works” were affected. These treasured works were consulted by Egyptologues and students. Even though the damaged items were “extremely useful” but they were not “unique.” Suggesting that the losses in these collections is not significant, Steinbock added, “At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.” “No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" The Guardian quoted the deputy administrator as saying. According to Bloomberg report, the most visited museum in the world suffered a leak from a water pipe that damaged treasured items kept in its library on Egyptian antiquities. In the Mollien wing, a valve from an obsolete heating and ventilation system accidentally opened which caused water to seep through the ceiling. The system was due to be replaced from next September and was shut off for several months. Francis Steinbock said that restoration of damaged works is in progress which will “be dried, sent to a bookbinder to be restored, and then returned to the shelves.” The concerned authorities launched an internal investigation into the leak. Notably four suspects have been charged in October jewel robbery but the whereabouts of the precious jewellery— including royal necklaces, tiaras and earrings — is still unknown.

The flare-up threatens to undermine months of diplomatic effort, including a high-profile agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The Thai Army spokesman Major General Winthai Suvaree said the strikes followed what Bangkok characterised as repeated Cambodian violations of the ceasefire in recent days. “Both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement,” he confirmed, noting that they deployed aircraft in response to what commanders considered “clear and immediate threats” along the border. Bangkok Post quoted the Thai Army stating that Cambodian troops opened fire in the Phu Pha Lek-Phlan Hin Paet Kon area at 2.15 pm. Two Thai soldiers were hit, prompting Thai forces to return fire. Cambodian troops later fired recoilless rifles, the statement said. Phnom Penh has issued its own accusations, alleging that Thai troops crossed into Cambodian territory and initiated hostilities first. Independent verification remains limited, and neither side has disclosed casualty figures. The Thailand-Cambodia border dispute erupted into a five-day war in July, centred on long-contested areas where overlapping historical claims have fuelled tensions for decades. The July fighting displaced civilians, stalled cross-border trade, and prompted urgent international mediation. A ceasefire agreement was subsequently brokered by President Trump and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, with Trump later witnessing the signing of an expanded deal in Kuala Lumpur in October. The accord was billed as a framework for long-term stabilisation and demilitarisation—terms now under strain following the renewed hostilities.

ICE agents cannot enter spaces like a home, school or private area of a workplace without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, Mamdani said.  \"ICE is legally allowed to lie to you, but you have the right to remain silent. If you're being detained, you may always ask, Am I free to go?' repeatedly until they answer you,\" said Mamdani, who will be sworn in as mayor on Jan 1. His comments came a week after demonstrators gathered as ICE attempted to detain people on Canal Street near New York's Chinatown. A similar immigration sweep in the same neighbourhood last October was also met with protests. \"New York will always welcome immigrants, and I will fight each and every day to protect, support, and celebrate our immigrant brothers and sisters,\" Mamdani said in Sunday's video.

The agriculture ministry acknowledges issues and is addressing feedback as the platform aims to improve market access and returns for farmers.", "content": "This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: The government's move to upgrade its digital farm marketplace, meant to give farmers access to more markets and better prices, has run into implementation glitches, with Rajasthan reporting data mismatches, login issues, and stalled mandi operations. The old electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) system was shut down even before onboarding to the revamped version was complete, forcing farmers back to local physical mandis, where fewer buyers mean reduced competition and lower price realisations, two people directly involved in the transition process told Mint on the condition of anonymity. The disruption could not have come at a worse time, as kharif crop arrivals start to surge. “Any disruption during the transition is therefore seen as significant, especially during the peak arrival season of kharif crops. When e-NAM is not working and farmers have to sell their produce in the physical mandi, they lose access to competitive bidding from multiple mandis, and must rely only on the traders present locally on that day, which reduces competition and can lead to lower prices,\" said the first of the two persons cited earlier, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. e-NAM is one of the central government's flagship digital reforms for agriculture, connecting about 18 million farmers through 1,522 mandis onboarded on the platform, out of the nearly 7,500 regulated mandis across the country. The platform aims to improve price discovery, reduce cartelization, and allow farmers to sell beyond their local mandis, helping them secure better returns and increase their income. In response to Mint 's queries, the agriculture ministry said that several suggestions and issues had been reported after the pilot launch in Rajasthan, and that its team is working to incorporate feedback and resolve problems.

President Zelensky could visit India as early as January 2026, according to a report in The Indian Express. A visit by Zelensky, nearly a month after Putin's, would be in line with New Delhi’s effort to stay engaged with both sides in the Russia–Ukraine war. In July 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Moscow to meet Putin. A month later, in August, he visited Ukraine and met Zelensky. Indian and Ukrainian officials have been in talks for several weeks, and New Delhi had reached out to Zelensky’s office even before Putin arrived in India, the report said, quoting people familiar with the developments. India’s stand on the Russia–Ukraine war has been one of calibrated balance: it calls for peace, dialogue and respect for sovereignty while avoiding taking sides PM Narendra Modi said during Putin's visit last week that India is \"not neutral” in this war and stands for peace. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has reiterated that violence must cease, that diplomacy is the only way forward, and that India remains committed to contributing to peace. The timing of the proposed visit, however, will depend on several factors, including the progress of former US President Donald Trump ’s peace plan and the situation on the battlefield, the report said. Ukraine’s domestic politics, where President Zelensky’s government is under pressure due to a major corruption scandal, could also play a role. In August last year, PM Modi visited Ukraine at the invitation of Zelensky in first first-ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since diplomatic relations were established between the two countries in 1992.

Witkoff hosted the meeting, said the White House official, who spoke on anonymity. The talks comes as the Trump administration attempts to coax its regional allies such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia to establish formal diplomatic relations with Israel. Such a coalition would help advance Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, but Israel’s strike in Qatar and military operations in Gaza have hindered the efforts. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on Saturday the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are going through “a critical moment.” There’s “a lot of uncertainty” over Middle East stability as deadly Israeli strikes continue to shake fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon and Iran’s standoff with the US remains unaddressed, he also told the Doha Forum on Sunday. Sunday’s meeting in New York was first reported by Axios. Israel’s strike on Doha, Qatar’s capital, was aimed at leaders of Hamas, the Palestinian terror group that attacked Israel in October 2023 — triggering the war in Gaza. The Doha attack prompted rare criticism of Israeli leaders by the White House and unnerved Gulf neighbors of Qatar, which hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The museum plans to restore the items and has increased ticket prices for non-EU visitors to fund infrastructure upgrades after recent security concerns.", "content": "A water leak at the Louvre Museum in Paris has reportedly damaged between 300 and 400 works in the Egyptian Antiquities department, the museum announced on 7 December 2025. The leak — discovered on 26 November — was caused by the accidental opening of a valve in the heating and ventilation system, which caused water to seep through the ceiling of the library area in the Mollien wing. According to the Louvre ’s deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, the affected material includes “Egyptology journals” and “scientific documentation” used by researchers — mostly books and archival items dating from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. The museum said that while the documents are “extremely useful,” they are “by no means unique.” Importantly, no unique heritage artefacts or irreplaceable objects were damaged, and the institution believes there are currently no irreparable losses to the collection. The Louvre has launched an internal investigation to determine exactly how the malfunction occurred. It acknowledged that the heating system responsible for the leak is “completely obsolete,” had been shut down for several months, and was scheduled to be replaced beginning September 2026 under broader renovation plans. As part of the damage control, the affected works will be carefully dried and treated, then sent to bookbinders for restoration before being returned to the shelves. Steinbock described the incident as “extremely regrettable,” and the museum said it will reinforce safety protocols to prevent any recurrence. The timing of the leak has added to the scrutiny on the Louvre’s infrastructure. Just weeks earlier, the museum suffered a dramatic daylight jewel heist — in which a four-member gang stole jewellery worth an estimated $102 million in only seven minutes — raising serious questions about security and maintenance at the world’s most-visited museum.

While Donald Trump Jr. has not played any public, prominent role in Russia-Ukraine talks mediated by the US, his latest comments are likely to come as alarming for the Volodymyr Zelenskyy-led administration, especially in wake of the recent scandal that saw Andriy Yermak resign.

He was beyond reproach,\" Trump Jr. said. \"...Years of corruption, years of graft and theft on a world stage that everyone in this room knew was happening was totally absolved...

Soon after she and husband Michael Dell released a video announcing the historic pledge, social media lit up with memes and comments, with many users fixating on the noticeable changes on her face as they asked “what happened?” The video sparked a global frenzy the moment it was released.

The internet has also dug up some of her old photos to compare them with the new pictures to point out the difference, overshadowing her philanthropic achievements. In the older images, her complexion appeared darker, features were softer and more natural, while the new video showed noticeably sharper features and wider eyes, and a comparitevely whiter skin tone. The contrast fueled online speculation about possible cosmetic enhancements, though nothing has been confirmed. This has never been confirmed by either Susan Dell or anyone close to her. But, Irish Star US spoke with some medical professionals to understand the visible changes on Susan Dell's face. Dr Ross Perry, Medical Director of Cosmedics skin clinics, said, “Several aesthetic procedures, surgical or non-surgical, could create this type of result.” “There is a possibility she may have undergone a full facelift, as the skin around the jawline and mid-face appears lifted,” he noted. For the wide eyes, the doctor said that Susan Dell may also have gone through a an “upper blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery)”.

While appearing for CBS' 'Face the Nation' programme on Sunday, Bessent spoke about the agricultural sector, including his own experiences running a soybean farm. “I'm involved in the agriculture industry… I run a soybean farm,” the US Treasury Secretary said, in reply to which he was asked, “You own it, or invest in it?” “People in my family go out and work on it,” was Bessent's response. “I actually divested it this week as part of my ethics agreement, so I'm out of that business but I probably know more about it than any Treasury Secretary,” he explained, clarifying his role in the operations of the farm. The New York Times , in August this year, had reported that Bessent, whose net worth is estimated at more than $500 million, owned corn and soybean farmland in North Dakota worth as much as $25 million. The US Treasury secretary also earned up to $1 million in annual rental income from the farms, NYT reported.

The statement came from the Israeli military, with army chief Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir making the announcement. \"We have operational control over extensive parts of the Gaza Strip and we will remain on those defence lines. The Yellow Line is a new border line -- serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity,\" Zamir said, as per news agency AFP . Under the Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) were required to withdraw to positions behind the Yellow Line. The area east of the Yellow Line, controlled by Israel, accounts for 53-58% of the area of the Gaza Strip. It should be noted that the status of the Yellow Line is officially temporary, serving as a de facto military border inside Gaza. Later phases of the peace plan envision further Israeli withdrawals and the eventual deployment of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). By the second withdrawal (and the deployment of the ISF), Israel's share of territory in Gaza is expected to be reduced to 40%, before a further reduction to 15% by the third withdrawal.

Amid the flight cancellation fiasco, a decades-old comedy clip from Jaspal Bhatti's legendary TV show ‘Full Tension’ has resurfaced on social media. The clip, titled ‘SOS Airline’, has gone viral just as IndiGo, one of India's largest airlines, grapples with significant operational issues. In the skit, passengers are seen rushing from one counter to another, pleading, arguing, and even trying to bribe their way into securing seats. Social media users who shared the clip pointed out how this feels oddly realistic. In the skit, one passenger, frustrated, asks, “ Samajh nahi aa rha ki trolley pe bhi aap hai, ticket par bhi aap hai, luggage par bhi aap hai? Jab aap ticket ke pure paise lete hain toh hona chahiye ki staff bhi pura ho .” (I don't get it, you are on the trolley, you're on the ticket, you’re on the luggage too?

Winter Park authorities said that police also found an AR-15 and six magazines — one loaded and five empty — along with a tactical vest, multiple knives, a black security vest, ear protection, and a pistols storage case from the student's dorm room.

Earlier, residents in Cotonou, the economic capital, reported hearing gunfire after a group of soldiers declared that they had removed President Patrice Talon from power. However, according to the president's entourage, he remained unharmed. Benin is a West African country located along the southern coast of the continent, bordering the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. It is situated between Togo to the west and Nigeria to the east, while Burkina Faso and Niger lie to its north. Its official capital is Porto-Novo, but Cotonou, located on the coast, serves as the economic hub, largest city, and de facto seat of government. Benin was formerly known as Dahomey during French colonial rule and gained independence in 1960, adopting the name Republic of Benin in 1975. Following its independence from France in 1960, the West African nation witnessed multiple coups, especially in the decades following its independence. Since 1991, the country has been politically stable following the two-decade rule of Marxist-Leninist Mathieu Kérékou. Benin faced the danger of a military coup after a group of soldiers claimed that they had removed the President Patrice Talon-led government, and the dissolution of the government following the swift takeover of power.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable.

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta?

Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture.

This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality.
