The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction. Germany has crossed 4 lakh international students in the 2024/25 winter semester, supported by dual-citizenship reforms. France aims to welcome 30,000 Indian students by 2030, pairing this target with clearer employment pathways.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

IIE, a not-for-profit headquartered in New York, Monday released a fall 2025 snapshot survey on international student enrolment at 825 higher education institutions in the US.

In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763728066.6208174}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process.

In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763728080.7486}

From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date. Immigration officials note that not all visa holders are expected to apply immediately for the additional five hours, as some may wait until their next visa renewal or may be nearing the end of their studies. The government has also extended in-study work rights to all tertiary students participating in approved exchange or Study Abroad programmes, including one-semester courses — a change designed to make New Zealand’s universities and colleges more appealing to international learners.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends. For those few who are genuinely interested in Chemistry as a career option and want to build, innovate, and explore, the decision between BTech in Chemical Engineering or BTech in Chemical Science and Technology becomes one of the most defining choices.

Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa.

Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts.

A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive. UPSC reports from 2010 to 2021 show consistently low participation of women and transgender individuals in the Civil Services Examination, with 2021 being the most recent data available. According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam. On the other hand, in the same year, 19 transgender candidates applied to sit for the UPSC exam, but just four appeared, and none made it to the final list. While the above represents just one exam cycle, a more comprehensive view emerges when we analyse UPSC CSE annual report data across 2010-2021. The data indicate a consistent upward trajectory in the proportion of women appearing for the UPSC Civil Services Examination. However, despite this progress, the overall trajectory has remained below the 40 per cent mark, underscoring the persistent gender gap in participation.

Each winner will receive Rs 31.5 lakh to further develop their innovations. WaterSense, developed by Polish PhD candidate Filip Budny from the Warsaw University of Technology, won in the Sustainability category. The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible. James Dyson, founder of Dyson, said, “The James Dyson Award supports young inventors who think differently and tackle real-world problems head-on. Filip and Alessandra exemplify that spirit, offering practical and ingenious solutions to health and environmental challenges.” This year’s competition — the 20th edition of the global student design award — received over 2,100 entries from 28 countries and regions.

If you cover those chapters properly, you may not need to study the rest. I am not saying the numbers are accurate, but you can get the point that if we cover some important chapters, we can get more marks than trying to cover all chapters equally.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

In comparison, around 40% of all global student permit applications were refused in both years, while rejection rates for Chinese students stood at just 24%. The number of Indian applicants also fell dramatically — from 20,900 in August 2023 to 4,515 in August 2025. Despite the drop, India continued to record the highest refusal rate among all nations with more than 1,000 accepted applicants. The surge in refusals comes against the backdrop of ongoing diplomatic tension between New Delhi and Ottawa. Relations soured last year when former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged Indian involvement in the 2023 killing of a Canadian Sikh separatist leader — a claim that India has repeatedly and strongly denied. Canada’s immigration department said it has ramped up fraud detection efforts after uncovering over 1,550 fake study permit applications in 2023, most linked to forged acceptance letters from Indian agents.

Helsinki’s annual Slush conference this year showed a venture market that feels like it is on the brink of transformation, one that’s ready for its first trillion-dollar startup. Founders, venture investors and government officials alike acknowledged the hurdles that have traditionally held Europe back from reaching its true scale and potential. For many years, European founders moved to the U.S. to start their companies or exited earlier than they needed to since they were operating in a market that lacked local customers and cash. Firms including OMERs Ventures and Coatue made concerted efforts to enter Europe by opening offices in London after the pandemic, but have since shuttered those shops . OMERs, for example, let much of its European team go . Meanwhile, Silicon Valley firms have claimed in the last few years that to focus on innovation, startups and investors need to retreat to San Francisco .

One investor specifically said there is absolutely more U.S. capital in the European market now than five years ago. Plus, some headlines draw more attention than others: When OMERs Ventures announced its retreat, IVP and Andreessen Horowitz both said they were opening offices in London.

Digital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly $789 million) in losses in the first five months of 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Many incidents likely go unreported, either because victims are unsure how to file a complaint or wish to avoid additional scrutiny. On Thursday, Google announced the expansion of its real-time scam-detection feature, which uses Gemini Nano to analyze calls on-device and flag potential fraud without recording audio or sending data to Google’s servers. The feature is off by default and applies only to calls from unknown numbers, and it plays a beep during the conversation to notify participants.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer. In the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. Joby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole. “This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.” Archer was quick to strike back. “Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Joby’s case is entirely without merit.

The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions. The company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options. Up to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. To start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo. It’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged. OpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos. The move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience. “Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. Thursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1 , which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model.

For Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse. Untapped Solutions had a different challenge.

The iOS-only app lets anyone create new AI-generated photos using “recipes,” which are like Mad Lib-style, fill-in-the-blank prompts for your photos, texts, or sketches. For instance, you could ask Mixup to turn your scribbled sketch into a beautiful Renaissance painting, or to reimagine your pet in a funny Halloween costume. You could use a selfie to see what you’d look like with a different hairstyle, or create something even sillier — like envisioning a friend transformed into the form of Italian brainrot . The app is built on top of Google’s Nano Banana, but the “recipe” format opens up a new way to interact with the model — turning a generative tool into an online party game. “The thing that [Nano Banana] did that no model did before was that it could take your image and maintain it in a convincing way that wasn’t creepy,” said Things, Inc. founder and CEO Jason Toff , whose background includes working on experimental apps inside Big Tech companies like Google and Meta, as well as time spent managing product at Twitter. But what makes Mixup particularly fun to use is that the app’s “recipes” — the user-generated AI prompts — are shareable. “Generative AI is so powerful, and yet most of the time you go to these tools and it’s like, here’s your text box — come up with something creative. And what do you write?” Toff said, speaking to the shortcomings his team saw with the current AI landscape. “And so, rather than having to be creative and think about what to create, you see something that worked, and you can just fill in the blanks,” he said. After users create a new prompt in Mixup, they can choose to publish it along with the resulting photo to a public feed or just download it for personal use.

People can use Perplexity as the default search engine, and they can also mention tabs to ask questions to the assistant. They can also use the voice mode to ask questions about all open tabs. Plus, the assistant can summarize searches across all tabs. Perplexity said the browser can research and shop on your behalf as well, and you can look at what action the Comet assistant is taking. What’s more, the Android version has an in-built ad blocker. The company said in the coming weeks it aims to add new features to the app, including a conversational agent that can search across sites and take actions, creating shortcuts for the assistant to take quick actions, and a fully functional password manager in coming weeks. Earlier this month, the startup updated its Comet Assistant on desktop to efficiently perform more complex tasks that run for longer, like shifting data from a website to a spreadsheet. While Perplexity has chosen to launch on Android, the company said it will also come to iOS soon. The company noted that Android has been a priority because of the volume of carriers and OEMs that have asked the startup to include Comet on their devices and solutions.

The new functionality is first rolling out to the Pixel 10 lineup and works with iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices. Google plans to expand the functionality to additional Android devices in the future. The company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses. Quick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share. “This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a blog post . The tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen. Google notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file. The feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged. “We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.” It’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/androids-quick-share-now-works-with-iphones-airdrop-starting-with-the-pixel-10-lineup/", "timestamp": 1763728248.3421762}

And investors seem to agree. Point One Navigation, a startup that has developed precise location technology, has just raised $35 million in a Series C round led by Khosla Ventures. The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. Point One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves, from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device. For Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. To achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix. Point One started with a focus on automotive clients — a sign of the bullish autonomous vehicle technology times. That sector continues to make up a large slice of its revenue. Point One couldn’t disclose most of its commercial customer names, but it did share that its technology supports the advanced driver assistance and infotainment needs of an EV maker and is included in more than 150,000 of its vehicles. Point One also has contracts with some of the largest mowing and turf care manufacturers, a distribution company’s fleet of 300,000 last-mile delivery vehicles, and a global manufacturer of street and racing bikes.

Over three decades in Silicon Valley, she’s mastered the art of getting anyone on the phone with a simple text: “Can you call me?” or “Let’s talk tomorrow.” And they do. Now, as she prepares to leave Khosla Ventures (KV) after nearly five years as the firm’s first-ever CMO, Daver could be an indicator of where the tech world is headed. Her career has been a remarkably accurate barometer of the industry’s next big thing to date. She was at Inktomi during the search wars of the late ’90s (the dot.com highflier hit a $37 billion valuation before spiraling back to earth). She joined Netflix when people laughed at the idea of ordering DVDs online. She helped Walmart compete with Amazon on technology. She worked with Guardant Health to explain liquid biopsies before Theranos made blood testing infamous. She was even dressed down once by Steve Jobs over the marketing of a Motorola microprocessor (which could be its own short story). KV’s founder Vinod Khosla portrays his work with Daver thus: “Shernaz had a strong impact at KV as she helped me build our KV brand and was a valuable partner to our founders. I’m grateful for her time here and know we’ll stay close.” Asked about why she is leaving the firm, Daver was typically matter-of-fact. “I came to do a job, and the job was to build out the KV brand and to build out Vinod’s brand, and to help set up a marketing organization such that our companies and portfolios have somebody to go to. And I’ve done all of that.” It’s certainly true that when founders think of top AI investors, two to three venture firms spring to mind, and one of them is KV. It’s quite a turnaround for a firm that, for a period, was better known for Khosla’s legal battle over beach access than for his investments.

When it finally saw the year for itself, it was thunderstruck, telling him, “I am suffering from a massive case of temporal shock right now.” Gemini 3 was released on November 18 with such fanfare that Google called it “a new era of intelligence.” And Gemini 3 is, by nearly all accounts (including Karpathy’s), a very capable foundation model, particularly for reasoning tasks. Karpathy is a widely respected AI research scientist who was a founding member of OpenAI, ran AI at Tesla for a while, and is now building a startup, Eureka Labs, to reimagine schools for the AI era with agentic teachers. He publishes a lot of content on what goes on under-the-hood of LLMs . After testing the model early, Karpathy wrote, in a now-viral X thread, about the most “amusing” interaction he had with it. Apparently, the model’s pre-training data had only included information through 2024. So Gemini 3 believed the year was still 2024. When Karpathy attempted to prove to it that the date was truly November 17, 2025, Gemini 3 accused the researcher of “trying to trick it.” He showed it news articles, images, and Google search results.

Another possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior. This concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future.

Blue Origin is now referring to the two versions as New Glenn 9×4 and New Glenn 7×2. That added firepower will increase the New Glenn booster’s total thrust and allow it to carry “over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit,” slightly below Starship’s current theoretical capacity of 100 metric tons. SpaceX is working on new versions of Starship that could double that figure. The larger New Glenn will feature a much larger fairing (the forward-facing shield that covers the rocket’s payload) to allow bigger payloads at the top of the rocket.

Launching a video store feels like a natural evolution for Letterboxd, allowing users to rent movies instantly without having to navigate away from the platform. One of the key advantages of renting from Letterboxd, compared to other established platforms like Apple or Amazon, is its social discoverability features. If you notice a friend has logged a movie, you can check out their review and decide to rent it right then and there. The movie selection will also be based on what members actually want to watch, using data from the platform’s watchlists and activity. Rather than offering a random mix like some streaming services, the selection will feel more curated. Letterboxd has not yet announced the initial lineup of films or rental prices, but the company said users can expect rental availability and costs to vary by location. Notably, the platform won’t operate on a subscription model, and there won’t be late fees. The new feature will be compatible with iOS and Android devices, as well as Apple TV, Android TV, Chromecast, and AirPlay, with additional smart TV apps coming later.

For a few months last year, everyone became convinced that specific words like “delve” or “underscore” could give models away, but the evidence is thin, and as models have grown more sophisticated, the telltale words have become harder to trace. But as it turns out, the folks at Wikipedia have gotten pretty good at flagging AI-written prose — and the group’s public guide to “Signs of AI writing” is the best resource I’ve found for nailing down whether your suspicions are warranted. (Credit to the poet Jameson Fitzpatrick, who pointed out the document on X.) Since 2023, Wikipedia editors have been working to get a handle on AI submissions, a project they call Project AI Cleanup. With millions of edits coming in each day, there’s plenty of material to draw on, and in classic Wikipedia-editor style, the group has produced a field guide that’s both detailed and heavy on evidence. To start with, the guide confirms what we already know: automated tools are basically useless. Instead, the guide focuses on habits and turns of phrase that are rare on Wikipedia but common on the internet at large (and thus, common in the model’s training data). According to the guide, AI submissions will spend a lot of time emphasizing why a subject is important, usually in generic terms like “a pivotal moment” or “a broader movement.” AI models will also spend a lot of time detailing minor media spots to make the subject seem notable — the kind of thing you’d expect from a personal bio, but not from an independent source. The guide flags a particularly interesting quirk around tailing clauses with hazy claims of importance. Models will say some event or detail is “emphasizing the significance” of something or other, or “reflecting the continued relevance” of some general idea.

His proposal: use :-) and :-( as markers to distinguish jokes from serious comments. While Fahlman describes himself as “the inventor … or at least one of the inventors” of what would later be called the smiley face emoticon , the full story reveals something more interesting than a lone genius moment. The whole episode started three days earlier when computer scientist Neil Swartz posed a physics problem to colleagues on Carnegie Mellon’s “bboard,” which was an early online message board. The discussion thread had been exploring what happens to objects in a free-falling elevator, and Swartz presented a specific scenario involving a lit candle and a drop of mercury. That evening, computer scientist Howard Gayle responded with a facetious message titled “WARNING!” He claimed that an elevator had been “contaminated with mercury” and suffered “some slight fire damage” due to a physics experiment. Despite clarifying posts noting the warning was a joke, some people took it seriously. The incident sparked immediate discussion about how to prevent such misunderstandings and the “flame wars” (heated arguments) that could result from misread intent. “This problem caused some of us to suggest (only half seriously) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously,” Fahlman later wrote in a retrospective post published on his CMU website. “After all, when using text-based online communication, we lack the body language or tone-of-voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone.” On September 17, 1982, the next day after the misunderstanding on the CMU bboard, Swartz made the first concrete proposal: “Maybe we should adopt a convention of putting a star (*) in the subject f", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/a-computer-scientist-invented-the-emoticon-after-his-colleagues-misunderstood-sarcasm/", "timestamp": 1763728249.7826443}

Originally launched as a barebones password manager for the company to bundle alongside NordVPN , there was never much reason to use it. It lacked features, and even with a solid free plan, you could get better functionality elsewhere. Today, however, NordPass is one of the best password managers on the market. It’s still missing some features like Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) storage that help options like 1Password and Proton Pass shoot ahead of the pack, and it could stand to offer more organization. But the core service of storing and autofilling your passwords is excellent, bolstered by additional features like email masking. NordPass has a free plan, which is great to see in a post-LastPass world . I prefer Proton Pass for free password managers, mainly due to the fact that it supports cross-device sync. But NordPass still allows you to store unlimited logins and autofill in your browser or on mobile, and you don’t need to enter a credit card to sign up. The free plan comes with the same backbone as the paid offering, including xChaCha20 encryption and biometric authentication. It technically supports cross-device sync, too, but it’s a little strange. You can access your vault from any device, but unlocking your vault on one device will log you out on another. You can only have one device authenticated at a time. In addition to extra convenience across devices, the Premium plan has a slew of features, including breach monitoring, a password health dashboard, support for attachment and document storage, sharing capabilities, and email masking. Email masking is one of the biggest features that drew me toward Proton Pass for my personal use—it hides your real email address—and I love that it's here in NordPass.

And that's too bad: This change, one of the more overlooked new features in macOS 26 , means you can use Apple's on-board AI to do all kinds of things while designing shortcuts. Look, I get it: Apple Intelligence makes AI a feature, not a product , and features are generally less interesting to read about than full-blown products. And Apple Shortcuts—which lets you create one simple automation to execute multiple tasks—is one of those features that's easy to overlook. But it can save you a lot of time, if you're willing to put in a bit of effort to automate tasks you do often. I, for example, set up my daily journal with Shortcuts, creating a fresh journal entry that pulls in things like the weather, a quote, and a general structure. I use this shortcut just about every day, and it makes my life better. Adding a large language model to Shortcuts means it's easier to build automations that can simplify your life. Here's how: Head to Apple Shortcuts, create a new shortcut, and you'll see “Apple Intelligence” as one of the listed applications that's supported. There are a few Actions related to text, allowing you to do things like proofread, summarize, and make a list from text. You also get the ability to create an image, if you want. For my money, though, the most useful Action offered is “Use Model,” mostly because of how open-ended it is. With this you can choose between three models—the totally offline and private model running on your device, a server offered by Apple using the same models, or even ChatGPT (no subscription or API key necessary). You can write any prompt you want, allowing you to manipulate text in all kinds of useful ways.

The RAISE Act passed through New York’s legislature in June, and is due to be signed or vetoed by governor Kathy Hochul before the end of the year. It’s one of a handful of state AI safety bills across the country that attempt to regulate AI developers—even as the Trump administration readies an executive order aimed at thwarting state-level AI laws. This effort is what landed Bores squarely in the crosshairs of Leading the Future. In addition to backing from venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, the recently formed PAC is also funded by OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale. Andreessen Horowitz declined WIRED’s request for comment. Brockman and Lonsdale did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. Leading the Future plans to spend millions of dollars to kill Bores’ bid for Congress. “Assemblyman Bores has advanced exactly the type of ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s, ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation,” said the PAC’s leaders, Zac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, in a statement to WIRED.

To combat “con crud,” New Zealand's premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees. To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO 2 monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids’ areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. \"It’s ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry,\" the organizers wrote on the convention’s website. \"What they did is fantastic,\" Jeff Moss, founder of the Defcon and Black Hat security conferences, told WIRED. \"CO 2 is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available.

That’s what eCoffee Energyband, a Chinese gadget that sells for just over $100, is claiming to do. First released in late 2023, the product is a lightweight wearable with two electrode pads that sit against the inner wrist. WAT Medical , a Canadian company with a Chinese subsidiary making and marketing the device, claims the mild electrical signals sent by the wristband can keep wearers alert by stimulating nerves in the brain. The effect is supposedly about the same as a cup of coffee, minus the risk of caffeine addiction. The only side effect is that your hand could feel numb from the tip of the finger to the inner wrist, the company says, so the makers suggest that it only be worn for three hours a day, and users can switch which wrists they put it on. The gadget would likely have stayed in relative obscurity if the company that makes it had not attended a recent Chinese trade show, whereafter it suddenly went viral. “The purpose of inventing this eCoffee Energyband is not to replace coffee. Coffee is great, but it’s not always suitable for the afternoon or evening. But we still have the need to feel refreshed during those times,” Xu Haojie, the company’s director of operations, told Chinese state media Xinhua at the trade show. After wearing it, the Xinhua reporter said, “It feels like I’m being gently tapped. I can feel the electric pulse.” It immediately became a sensation online. On Chinese ecommerce websites, including JD and Taobao, the device appears to be sold out as of now, with hundreds of mixed reviews from buyers. The device is also sold and shipped to markets around the world. The website lists its normal price at $130, with a holiday promotion going on right now that knocks 30 percent off the price.

From website banner ads to outdoor billboards, images generated by businesses using AI tools surround me. Hell, even the bar down the street posts happy hour flyers with that distinctly hazy, amber glow of some AI graphics.

Many of the updates in this release are targeted at corporate adoption, from putting Nano Banana Pro in Google Slides for business presentations to integrating the new model with Google Ads for advertisers globally. This “Pro” release is an iteration on its Nano Banana model that dropped earlier this year. Nano Banana became a viral sensation after users started posting personalized action figures and other meme-able creations on social media. Nano Banana Pro builds out the AI tool with a bevy of new abilities, like generating images in 4K resolution. It’s free to try out inside Google’s Gemini app, with paid Google One subscribers getting access to additional generations. One specific improvement is going to be catnip for corporations in this release: text rendering. From my initial tests generating outputs with text, Nano Banana Pro improves on the wonky lettering and strange misspellings common in many image models, including Google’s past releases. Google wants the images generated by this new model—text and all—to be more polished and production-ready for business use cases. “Even if you have one letter off it's very obvious,” says Nicole Brichtova, a product lead for image and video at Google DeepMind . “It's kind of like having hands with six fingers; it's the first thing you see.” She says part of the reason Nano Banana Pro is able to generate text more cleanly is the switch to a more powerful underlying model, Gemini 3 Pro .

Over the past few years, the US has introduced a series of export control rules designed to prevent Chinese organizations from acquiring computer chips that have become popular for developing AI chatbots . The restrictions aim to slow China in what US officials have described as a race to develop powerful AI systems , including surveillance tools and autonomous weapons . Some Chinese companies have been forced to make do with older or less capable chips, but others have allegedly turned to smugglers. The new indictment alleges that Hon Ning Ho, Brian Curtis Raymond, Cham Li, and Jing Chen worked together to buy Nvidia chips through a sham real estate company in Florida and then resold them to Chinese companies. The hardware was allegedly shipped to China using doctored customs paperwork by way of Thailand and Malaysia, two countries that US regulators have identified as hot spots for chip smuggling. Prosecutors allege that the defendants exported about 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs and attempted to smuggle about 50 of Nvidia’s newer chips, known as the H200. The defendants are also accused of trying to export about 10 Hewlett Packard Enterprise supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 chips.

Platform incompatibility has fostered real-life social friction, like the “ green bubble shaming ” phenomenon, where iPhone owners exclude Android owners from group chats.

Google also worked with Apple to create a specification for unwanted tracking alerts—when your phone identifies an AirTag or another Bluetooth tracker on your person. Today, Google is fixing incompatibility issues with AirDrop. iPhone owners have been able to easily share files, contacts, photos, and anything else through Apple's wireless sharing system, provided both parties have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Android phones have their own sharing protocol called Quick Share , but starting today and beginning with Google's Pixel 10 smartphones , Quick Share can work with AirDrop to send data to iPhones, iPads , and Macs of any variety . The caveat is that the iPhone user will need to switch AirDrop into the “Everyone for 10 Minutes” mode instead of \"Contacts Only\" mode. Google says this isn't some kind of workaround solution. It's a direct, peer-to-peer connection; your data isn't routed through a server, shared content isn't logged, and no extra data is shared.

It was called Swatch x You , and it let you tweak Swatch's standard New Gent 41-mm model by selecting one of the (surprisingly limited) preset designs, which you could then move, zoom, and rotate to fit over the watch and strap. You could also add in a chip for NFC payments, and, as a final flourish, put a very short personal message on the case back (to a maximum of 15 characters). As you can tell, although a fun idea, this offering was never designed to be anything near approaching bespoke. From tomorrow, however, the MoonSwatch maker is taking its Swatch x You model and giving it an artificial intelligence makeover. Dubbed AI‑DADA, Swatch says this AI-powered design tool lets you create entirely unique watches starting from a blank canvas and using only your imagination as a guide to the final outcome. After logging into your Swatch account, you prompt AI‑DADA with your own idea, then, in less than two minutes, a “unique watch design comes to life.” To underline this uniqueness, each AI‑DADA watch carries a “1/1” sign on its case back.

The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen.

The holiday shopping season is upon us, and it's when some of the best deals of the year make their appearance. Ahead of Black Friday , Best Buy has been offering some really solid tech deals on some of our favorite products we've tested and reviewed, ranging from laptops and gaming mice to cordless vacuums. So, whether you're shopping for the perfect gift for that tech lover in your life or if you've been waiting all year for prices to drop on something for yourself, there are a few great options below. For more great discounts, check out our Best Early Black Friday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here . Apple Best Buy Amazon Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to get the bump to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance all around. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

But there are better options out there.", "content": "8 /10 The thing I remember most about my childhood Nintendo Game Boy was how dirty the screen was. I managed to break it right away, popping the screen cover off completely. I don't know if it was leftover glue or some sweet sugary substance I spilled on it, but the edges of the frame remained weirdly sticky with some gunk that liked to collect dirt. Gross as it was, and even without a screen cover, it still played games just fine for years. While not always the most durable of devices, the OG handheld Nintendo consoles could withstand enough of a beating to firmly enmesh themselves into the core memories of millions of dweebs of all ages. That is what the ModRetro Chromatic wants to be: the ultimate, hardiest version of the Game Boy ever. The Game Boy sigma , if you will. A sturdy box of nostalgia that you can take to your grave. ModRetro is a company run by Palmer Luckey, best known as the founder of the virtual reality company Oculus—now a Meta property. Nowadays, Luckey is a defense tech guy , busy cozying up to the Trump administration and running his company Anduril , the military contractor building AI-controlled weapons for the Pentagon, such as lethal drone swarms and killer chatbots . ModRetro Chromatic Rating: 8/10 ModRetro shares its name with an old online forum Luckey used to run, and it's more of a passion project. The goal is to recreate old-school gaming machines and package them in the slickest, most robust frames possible. With the Chromatic complete, the company plans to make a robust version of the Nintendo 64 next. Luckey has called these devices “a portal into the past that is going to live on forever.” Should you be concerned if your money is going to an arms dealer who also thinks cigarettes were good for society? Sure, probably. Are you going to let that influence what you buy? We'll see about that. ModRetro Chromatic Rating: 8/10 Sheer nostalgia is a powerful marketing force, after all.

The best protein powders are an easy boost to any of your go-to recipes, from smoothies to muffins to morning waffles.

While the recommended daily allowance for protein is just 0.36 grams per pound of body weight , that’s the minimum to avoid deficiency, not the sweet spot for optimal health.

But the trick to getting rid of paper is to not worry about being perfect.", "content": "Wanting to get rid of paper in your life is easy. Following through with that promise to yourself is hard. I've been mostly paperless for close to 15 years, and the trick to it for me was to think about it the same way I think about taking care of my teeth. Staying organized is a kind of hygiene. It's almost never a one-and-done cleanup job. So think about dental hygiene . We learn to brush our teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and see a dentist every six months to catch problems before they get worse. However, if you don't follow that schedule precisely, you can still have good dental hygiene. You just have to do enough . If you do almost everything you're supposed to, but you miss two days of flossing or are a few months late scheduling your next cleaning, your teeth won't suddenly fall out. With hygiene (or any kind of maintenance), you don't have to be perfect; you just have to be good enough. Going paperless is very much like that. Here, I want to share with you the plan I used to remove most paper from my life. It should help you get started, but know in advance that you don't have to stick to it exactly every moment of every day. You can mess up. You can forget. So long as you get into the habit most of the time, you'll find yourself mostly paperless in a couple of months. Decide where to keep digitized papers. A natural choice is to save them in a cloud storage service , such as Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. By saving them in the cloud, you always have a backup. If you save files locally to your device, you could lose them all if your device is destroyed, lost, or stolen. Create an inbox. An inbox is nothing more than a folder where you will save newly scanned papers by default. If you are highly organized, you might have specific folders where you want to sort each paper you scan. That's great. But where will the files go when you're feeling lazy or strapped for time?

Could this deeply misunderstood body part really be the seat of so much modern dysfunction?", "content": "I was settling into one of those airport activity tables with high stools and electric outlets at my flight’s gate, waiting for the agent to announce boarding, when I felt a gathering storm at the apex of my butt cheeks. This was my last flight after being away from home on a book tour in May. For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves. But I’d moved just fine from plane to hotel to bookstore. I’d even made a point of walking to the bookstores from hotels and back, to indulge some kind of Walt Whitman–esque fantasy. But now, at the last moment, alarm bells were going off. The pain felt as if I’d taken a hard hit to my tailbone, as I’d once done after going off a jump in an inner tube and landing ass-first on hard-packed snow. But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute. I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination. By the time I had to stand up, it was all I could do to not cry out—as bad as the pain was sitting down, standing up sent a radical guitar solo through my coccyx. At that time, I was about four months postpartum from delivering my first baby, and had had a blissful recovery, all things considered. I had pelvic muscles of steel, thanks to over a decade of lifting heavy weights, a practice I continued until two weeks before giving birth. I had only been back to lifting for a couple of months—deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead press, here and there some rows or lat pull-downs—but everything had been going well. At first I thought maybe the pain would disappear as quickly and mysteriously as it came.

Our favorite machines here can turn your barista into a stranger.", "content": "Amazon Ratio Amazon Amazon Drip coffee has undergone a quiet revolution. The best coffee makers of today are nothing like the stained break-room Mr. Coffee you might remember from your first office job. Drip is now, uh, drip . The new generation of drip coffee machines is not just technologically sophisticated but kinda culturally sophisticated—exercising tight control of time and temperature and even borrowing some barista techniques from third-wave café pour-over to get beautiful, gentle, aromatic extraction without the burn or bitterness. As a longtime booster for drip coffee, I'm loving this moment. Besides, filtered coffee is good for you. What's better, most of the best drip coffee machines on this list have a lower difficulty rating than your toaster oven . My top pick, the Fellow Aiden ($400) , is a powerful machine that can account for your local elevation and has special recipes for individual coffee beans—and yet WIRED reviewer Pete Cottell managed a great mug within eight minutes of unpacking the box. My favorite full-flavored single-mug device, the Ratio Four ($259) , has only a single button. So without even trying, you can sip your drip coffee at home and say, “Man, I really taste the lychee notes in this natural-process gesha.” Or just enjoy the delicious, delicious joe. After jittering myself up testing 20 drip coffee makers this year, these are my favorite fully automated immersion-brew coffee makers that make flavorful drip, pour-over coffee, or something splendidly in between.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent. Similarly, since implementation of the Online Safety Act , Pornhub has lost nearly 80 percent of its UK viewership. The company argues that it’s a privacy risk to leave age verification up to third-party sites and that people will simply seek adult content on platforms that don’t comply with the laws. “We have seen an exponential surge in sea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pornhub-is-urging-tech-giants-to-enact-device-based-age-verification/", "timestamp": 1763728253.5000896}

In the short term, it's cheaper and easier to just leave those boxes running in a forgotten closet. But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.” Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.

Get up to 14% off plans for three months, including Starter, Standard, and Plus tiers.", "content": "Google Workspace is the modern business world’s de facto productivity suite, and it’s only gotten better over the years. There’s the centralization of Google Docs , Drive, and Gmail, of course, but Google has bolstered its productivity suite with an AI infusion via Gemini, as well as simplified its offerings to work for massive corporations all the way down to individual users . If you want to get the best price, you need a Google Workspace promo code. Thankfully, you’ve landed in the right spot. Google is offering Workspace discounts until the end of 2025, allowing you to save up to 14 percent on a plan for your first three months. You just need to use one of the coupon codes linked above. Google Workspace works for both individual users and businesses, but if you’re just looking for more Drive space and a few extra features, take a look at Google One . Now through the beginning of 2026 (January 1), Google is offering a discount on all of its Workspace plans, including Starter, Standard, and Plus. Regardless of which plan you choose, or when you sign up, you’ll get a discount on your first three months of service as long as your plan starts before January 1, 2026. There are some notable differences between each Workspace plan – I’ll dig into them in the next section – but all three plans come with access to the full slate of Workspace apps. You get Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Meet, of course, but even the cheapest Starter plan includes basic access to Google’s other apps, such as NotebookLM and Gemini inside the Workspace suite. If you want to save, make sure to click one of the promo codes at the top of this page to secure your discount. Google offers four different Workspace plans, though only three are relevant for most people.

A draft of the order viewed by WIRED directs US attorney general Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force,” whose purpose is to sue states in court for passing AI regulations that allegedly violate federal laws governing things like free speech and interstate commerce. Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation. These groups are lobbying instead for a light-touch set of federal laws to guide AI progress. “If the president wants to win the AI race, the American people need to know that AI is safe and trustworthy,\" says Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-prepares-executive-order-challenging-state-ai-laws/", "timestamp": 1763728254.4643602}

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said. The CEO’s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments. But the increase was not enough to fully make up for the recent sell-off. Nvidia has enjoyed three years of booming success since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and caused a massive surge in demand for the company’s GPUs, which are used to train and operate generative AI systems. Nvidia dominates the global market for GPUs, and its latest releases have become highly sought after, with demand far exceeding supply. On Wednesday, Nvidia executives reiterated that it has about $500 billion in unfilled orders. The company has used its newfound wealth to buy back its own shares and invest billions of dollars in AI companies, including top users and customers of its chips such as ChatGPT developer OpenAI, data center operator CoreWeave , and Elon Musk’s xAI , which develops the chatbot Grok.

Aaron Saunders, who is partly responsible for giving the world back-flipping and dancing machines, joined as the VP of hardware engineering earlier this month. The hire is a key part of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis’ vision for Gemini to become a sort of robot operating system, similar to how Google supplies its Android software to an array of smartphone manufacturers. “You can sort of think of it as a bit like an Android play [...] We want to build an AI system, a Gemini base, that can work almost out-of-the-box, across any body configuration,” Hassabis said in an interview with WIRED. “Obviously humanoids, but nonhumanoids too.” Boston Dynamics is famous for developing legged robots, including four-legged dog-sized systems and humanoid machines capable of impressive acrobatic feats. Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years.

When it debuted at CES early this year, the Brisk It Zelos-450 was advertised as being \"the first grill with generative AI.\" That AI comes in the form of \"Vera,\" an in-app feature that “creates customized recipes based on your input\" and then sets the grill's temperature to cook them. The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice.

Interactions with AI tools are often mundane, but they can also lead to dire outcomes. Users sometimes experience mental breakdowns during lengthy conversations with chatbots or confide in them about their suicidal ideations . “We need to have really big conversations across society about what role we want AI to play in our future as humans who are interacting with each other,” says Ryn Linthicum, head of user well-being policy at Anthropic . At the event‚ organized by Anthropic and Stanford, industry folk intermingled with academics and other experts, splitting into small groups to talk about nascent AI research and brainstorming deployment guidelines for chatbot companions.

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763728255.8916686}

The startup plans to put its fully autonomous robots in homes next year.", "content": "Memo may not be the world’s fastest barista, but it is impressive—for a robot. I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again. Unlike humans, industrial robots cannot typically adapt or improvise to changes or unfamiliar situations. The last decade has seen some companies build robo", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/memo-sunday-robotics-home-robot/", "timestamp": 1763728256.014714}

Your body needs fuel to fend off viruses and bacteria floating around. These four fruits pack compounds that strengthen your immune defenses, reduce inflammation in your throat, and give you the nutritional ammo to resist or shorten a cold's grip. Eat smart, stay well. Oranges brim with vitamin C, which cranks up your white blood cell production. These cells hunt down infection-causing germs. One orange daily or fresh juice keeps your throat clear and your immune system firing on all cylinders. Plus, the water content keeps you hydrated during dry winter days. Guava outpunches oranges in vitamin C content, gram for gram. Its skin holds most nutrients, so wash and eat the whole thing. Guava's fiber and antioxidants support digestion and mucus clearance. In winter, this underrated fruit becomes your secret weapon against respiratory strain and lingering coughs. One kiwi delivers more vitamin C than an orange, plus bromelain-like enzymes that ease sore throats and reduce inflammation. Kiwis also contain antioxidants called polyphenols that tackle oxidative stress. Eat two daily, and you're building a robust defense against seasonal viruses. Pineapple's bromelain enzyme is a game changer. It breaks down mucus in your chest and nasal passages, making breathing easier when congestion kicks in. High in vitamin C and antiviral compounds, pineapple works best when eaten fresh post meal, aiding both digestion and immune function simultaneously. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

Know how 10 minutes cutback everyday can affect your attention span, anxiety and sleep", "summary": "Studies reveal that cutting just ten minutes of daily reel consumption can meaningfully improve focus, eye comfort, sleep quality, and emotional balance. Here's what the science shows about why scrolling hijacks your brain and what happens when you stop.", "content": "Reels are engineered to hook you. Algorithms, fast cuts, dopamine hits from likes. Ten minutes sounds small, but that deliberate cut kickstarts a cascade of brain and body fixes most folks never notice until they try it themselves. Each notification, like, and swipe releases dopamine, the feel-good chemical. Constant hits desensitize your reward pathways. You need more stimulation to feel anything. Cutting ten minutes daily lets dopamine sensitivity recover, restoring natural motivation and pleasure. Reels fragment focus deliberately. Rapid scrolling trains your brain to crave fragmented input. Stop ten minutes daily and within weeks, sustained concentration returns. Reading books, studying, even conversations become less arduous and feel genuinely engaging again. Constant reel-watching slashes blink rates by fifty percent. Dry eyes, accommodation spasms, and early myopia follow. Ten fewer minutes means tears regenerate, eye muscles relax, and strain diminishes noticeably within days. Long-term: potential sight preservation matters genuinely here. Blue light from screens suppresses melatonin, the hormone signaling your body to sleep. Ten minutes less before bed lets your circadian rhythm normalize. Deeper sleep, less grogginess, steadier mood follow within a week or two consistently. Social comparison, algorithmic rage, endless notifications trigger cortisol spikes and chronic low-grade stress. Those ten minutes daily break the cycle incrementally. Mental fatigue eases, emotional regulation improves, and that gnawing sense of inadequacy loosens its hold surprisingly quickly. Cognitive load from reels depletes mental reserves. Even small interruptions feel catastrophic when your brain's overtaxed. Ten fewer minutes restores mental bandwidth. Work feels less exhausting, creative thinking emerges, and tasks finish faster with substantially less friction involved overall.

These aren't sexy resolutions. They're boring micro adjustments that quietly reshape your bank account, sleep, or waistline because they slot into existing routines instead of fighting your wiring. Compounding feels magical only in hindsight. Get direct sunlight in your eyes within thirty minutes of waking. This regulates your body's circadian tempo, solidifying sleep-wake cycles and energy stability. No app needed, costs zero. People report better sleep that very first night. Your brain's serotonin production depends on it. Skip coffee for ninety minutes after waking. Your cortisol is already spiking naturally. Instead, drink electrolytes in warm water. This kills midday crashes, dulls jitters, and stops caffeine dependency cold. Two benefits interlock: stable morning energy and amplified afternoon alertness when coffee lands. Dump stress onto paper. Fifteen minutes daily for ninety days improves blood pressure and liver function per research. Writing forces your brain to untangle vague anxiety into solvable chunks. Side effect: clarity on what actually matters versus background noise you're carrying. Ordering out \"saves time\" but sabotages energy via processed ingredients and hidden sodium. Home-cooked meals? Predictable, stable fuel. People eating the same simple foods report smooth, sustained energy all day, no 3 PM crash. Financial side: costs half what delivery steals. Don't touch your phone for the first five hours after waking. Work on one hard task in that window. Your prefrontal cortex performs at peak without notification interruption. Productivity isn't motivation—it's environment design. One deep task beats ten shallow tasks. Walking ten thousand steps daily slashes stiffness, improves sleep quality on day one, and sharpens focus during desk work. Physical restlessness evaporates. Blood pressure normalizes. Sleep becomes untethered. Zero gym friction; just walking counts.

But according to Nutritionist Khushi , your body doesn’t just absorb collagen from a scoop. Here’s what really happens inside and what actually helps your skin build collagen naturally . When you consume collagen, your body first breaks it down into amino acids and peptides. These fragments don’t directly turn into collagen in your skin. Instead, your body decides where to use them and that may not always be your face! To actually build collagen, your body needs more than just peptides. It depends on Vitamin C , zinc, copper, and protein to complete the process. Without these nutrients, that expensive collagen supplement might not do much at all. Instead of chasing powders, load up on real foods that fuel collagen naturally. Think citrus fruits, berries, nuts, seeds, paneer, eggs, and dals. These provide amino acids and antioxidants your body needs to rebuild healthy skin. If you truly want visible results, Red Light Therapy is a total game-changer. It works on the cellular level, stimulating fibroblasts, the skin cells that produce collagen and elastin. This helps tighten, brighten, and improve skin texture from within. Unlike supplements that depend on digestion, red light directly activates your skin’s repair system. It’s local, targeted, and scientifically shown to improve elasticity and glow. That’s why many experts consider it more efficient than taking collagen powders. The real secret is combining both approaches, good nutrition and smart tech. Eat a collagen-rich diet with bone broth, guava, lentils, tofu, eggs, pumpkin seeds, and mushrooms. Add Red Light Therapy for a double boost that supports your skin naturally and visibly. Nutritionist Khushi highlights, your skin glows when your body is nourished, so don’t rely only on shortcuts like collagen powders. Feed your skin from the inside and support it from the outside for real, lasting radiance.

Wrong. Recent research shows backward walking demands 17 to 20 percent more cardiovascular effort than forward walking at identical speeds, plus better blood sugar control markers. But forward walking wins on sustainability and joint safety. Here's what science actually says. Standard walking strengthens your heart gradually. Studies show five minutes post-meal walking cuts blood sugar spikes by measurable amounts. Every 1,000 extra daily steps drops major heart event risk by 17 to 20 percent. Safe for knees too. Walking backward kicks oxygen consumption up by 17 to 20 percent compared to forward at the same pace. Your heart works harder. Research shows backward walkers torch more calories without adding time. Perfect for time-pressed folks. Backward walking spikes your heart rate higher faster. Researchers measured both directions on uphill treadmills: every grade showed backward walking demanding significantly more cardiac effort. Your cardiovascular system gets a superior workout instantly. Post-meal walks lower glucose immediately. Data shows even tiny five-minute strolls flatten spikes. Backward walking burns energy differently but less research exists on glucose-specific effects. Forward walking remains the evidence-backed choice here. Backward walking reduces knee joint compression forces substantially. People recovering from knee injuries often prefer it. Forward walking, when overdone, can strain knees. If joints ache, reverse walking causes less discomfort during identical distances. Backward walking activates underused quadriceps and glutes intensely. Forward walking primarily targets calves and shins. Neither is \"better,\" just different recruitment patterns. Mixing both builds balanced lower body strength practically. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

India’s five-year submissions, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), are meant to set more ambitious emission-cut targets. So far, as many as 120 of the 196 member countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)have submitted their updated climate plans. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming well below 2°C and ideally to 1.5°C. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), meeting those goals will require cutting annual emissions by 35% to 55% by 2035 compared with 2019 levels. India is commonly counted as the third-largest emitter of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), after China and the United States. Some Indian officials, however, argue that focusing solely on total emissions overlooks this per capita context. Its per capita emissions are relatively low — around 2 tonnes per person. The formal deadline for submitting the updated NDCs for the 2035 cycle was 10 February 2025. However, the UNFCCC allowed an extended cut-off until September 2025. Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav , who led the Indian delegation in Belem, told the media this week that Delhi would submit its updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by December. India and Saudi Arabia are the only two G20 nations yet to release their updated NDCs for the COP30 summit. The NDC document lists each country’s climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement and is released every five years. “We will declare our revised NDCs till 2035 and also the first Biennial Transparency Report,” Yadav said. Asked why India hadn’t submitted its updated NDC document, Yadav said it wasn’t because of missing any deadline. “There are several steps, including cabinet approval, before the document is released,” he", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/at-cop30-india-s-delayed-climate-agenda-draws-global-attention-when-will-new-delhi-submit-it-and-what-do-we-know-11763725527361.html", "timestamp": 1763728286.3999293}

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Offering a glimmer of hope for football fans, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Friday that it will take steps to conduct the Indian Super League (ISL) 2025-26 season, as the over ₹ 450 crore tournament failed to attract a single bidder amid administrative and fiscal uncertainty within the All India Football Federation (AIFF). Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the bench of Justices P. S. Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi that the government will intervene to ensure that the ISL is conducted and that players are not placed at any disadvantage. “I have spoken to the minister concerned. He is fully aware of the situation and has assured me that the league must be held. How it is to be financed, who the sponsors are, and other modalities can be left to the government.\" The assurance comes as 12 ISL clubs moved the court following the AIFF’s announcement that it had not received any bids for the 15-year contract for the league’s commercial and media rights, leaving the new season in limbo. Although the current 15-year Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Reliance Industries ' Football Sports Development Ltd (FSDL) expires on 8 December, FSDL has agreed to relinquish its rights due to differences with the governing body. To be sure, the fresh tender, issued on 16 October under a Supreme Court-appointed committee led by former Justice L. Nageswara Rao, drew interest from four parties: FSDL, Dream Sports Group's sports streaming platform FanCode, real estate player Conscient Group, and a foreign consortium. But none submitted bids. In their plea, reviewed by Mint , the clubs argued the tender failed because the new AIFF Constitution gives the federation sweeping control over all competitions and “primacy\" over key decisions. This leaves any commercial partner with almost no say in how its money is used, making the league commercially unviable.

It said that a court of enquiry was being formed to ascertain the cause of the HAL Tejas jet crash. “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident. IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted, to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it said. Tejas is a single-engine, multi-role light combat aircraft. It has been jointly developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) and the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) for the IAF. The IAF Tejas is equipped with a tailless, compound delta wing design with “relaxed static stability”, which enhances its manoeuvrability and agility. Tejas is India's first homegrown fighter aircraft, even though it has a foreign engine. The first test flight of the Technology Demonstrator-1 (TD-1) was conducted in 2001. Years later in 2016, the maiden flight of the Second Series Production (SP2) Tejas aircraft of Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) configuration was conducted. The HAL Tejas is capable of carrying out multiple functions, including aerial interception of enemy aircraft, air-to-surface strikes, and anti-shipping operations — making it perfect for a fighter jet. The IAF Tejas is built from a mix of aluminium-lithium alloys, titanium alloys, and advanced carbon-fibre composite materials, making it a light aircraft and therefore easy to manoeuver during tricky situations. These composite materials constitute 45% of the airframe by weight and 90% by surface area, making it one of the lightest among contemporary aircraft.

The controversy began when Vembu responded to a post by Upasana Konidela, vice-chairperson of CSR at Apollo Hospitals and spouse of actor Ram Charan, following her visit to IIT Hyderabad. According to Konidela, when she asked students how many of them wanted to marry, “more men raised their hands than the women,” prompting her to comment that “women seemed far more career-focused … This is the new – Progressive India.” In response, Vembu wrote on X that he advises “young entrepreneurs … to marry and have kids in their 20s and not keep postponing it.” He justified this by arguing that forming a family early is “a demographic duty to society and their own ancestors.” He acknowledged that his views may sound “quaint or old-fashioned,” but expressed confidence that they would “resonate again.” Namita Thapar hit back swiftly. On X, she posted a withering critique, calling on powerful figures like Vembu to tackle “real issues” rather than prescribing deeply personal life decisions. “A leader with influence has a huge responsibility to use his/her voice responsibly to take up REAL issues,” she wrote. In her post, Thapar sarcastically compared Vembu’s “marry in your 20s” prescription to the now-infamous call for a 70-hour work week. “Ten minutes back, I was shocked to read about this ‘marry in your 20s’ gyan… similar to another favourite number of mine – ‘70-hour work week’!!” she said, referencing comments made by Narayana Murthy in earlier years.

Johnson, who runs the longevity start-up Blueprint, credited strict sleep habits, nutrition, exercise and the elimination of “bad habits” for what he calls the “80/20” of his regimen. Johnson shared a detailed list of his biomarkers on X, writing: “I’m 48 but in many ways my body runs like an 18-year-old… If you’re in a good place, keep it up. If you’re struggling, take the first step; it’s always the hardest and always worth it.” He listed several metrics he says fall in the top percentile ranges for men and even teenagers, including: He also highlighted grip strength in the top 5% across all ages and listed several other markers he claims outperform much younger adults. Johnson’s post quickly went viral, inviting both admiration and scepticism. One user wrote, “You may not have figured out ‘how to not die’ but you’ve shown what it takes to be a 1% human biologically.” Another questioned the comparison, asking, “That’s amazing, but does your body really run like an 18-year-old?” A third chimed in more critically: “Just because biomarkers say you’re 18 doesn’t make you 18. Get in a boxing ring with a fit 18–26-year-old and the difference will show… and that’s okay! Life is valuable because it’s temporary.” Johnson has regularly made headlines for his unconventional longevity routines. Last week, the 48-year-old revealed that he took a five-gram dose of magic mushrooms as part of his research into ageing and brain health.

The first runner-up was 29-year old Praveenar Singh of Thailand and 25-year-old Stephany Adriana Abasali Nasser of Venezuela placed third. Rounding up the finishers were Ahtisa Manalo, 28, of the Philippines, and 27-year-old Olivia Yace of Ivory Coast who came fifth. Fatima Bosch was also the one who was criticised by the beauty pageant's host – among several dramatic missteps in the run-up to the final stage. Fatima Bosch staged a dramatic walkout earlier this month from a meeting where she was insulted by Thai organiser Nawat Itsaragrisil. During the event, Nawat Itsaragrisil apparently singled out Miss Mexico during a dispute over her apparent failure to post promotional content on her social media. As she was insulted, Fatima Bosch staged a walkout flanked by Miss Iraq and others. This led to Nawat Itsaragrisil warning others to “sit down” if they still wanted to participate.

The CBSE report said the Class 4 student, who died after jumping from the fourth floor, had faced sustained bullying, including verbal abuse with sexual references. It also revealed that despite approaching her teacher twice on the day of the incident, the schoolgirl was never referred to the counsellor. According to a Times of India ( TOI ) report, citing the CBSE inquiry report, 9-year-old Amaiyra's action occurred in an environment of “unbearable trauma and mental harassment ,” exacerbated by the school's failure to respond to repeated red flags. The committee reportedly stated that when Amaira arrived at the school on the day of the fatal incident, she appeared happy, cheerful, and carefree. In CCTV footage captured shortly before 11:00 AM on November 1, the young girl was seen dancing, chatting with classmates, laughing, and eating chocolates. CBSE said that it was “proof” to confirm that she exhibited no signs of distress at the beginning of the day, and it was what followed during the day that marked a sudden and troubling shift. According to the reports, Amaira became visibly upset in the classroom after 11 AM. CBSE said that “something unusual happened” in the class because she appeared “extremely disturbed” in the CCTV footage from after 11 AM. The report also mentions a CCTV video showing a heated exchange among students, which, according to parents and apparently from the clip, may have involved the use of “bad words and derogatory remarks”. The centre of Amaira's cause of trigger is reportedly a digital slate on which a group of boys wrote or drew something that embarrassed and distressed her.

He also requested that his organs be donated. \"Sorry bhaiya, for all the time I was rude to you,\" he wrote to his brother, and to his mother, he said, \" Sorry mummy, however many times I broke your heart, I am going to do it for the last time.\" He expressed gratitude toward his parents and his guilt at not being able to do more for them. The officer said the note ended with the boy asking that whatever remained of him be used to help someone else. \"Give my organs to those in need,\" he wrote, adding that if any organs were still functioning after the fall, they should be donated. The suicide note recovered from his school bag read, “I am very sorry I did this, but the school staff said so much that I had to do it.

The tech executive, who grew up in Meerut and studied at IIT Delhi, added that the pollution felt “personal.” “I love this place—its energy, people, food, and so much more,” he wrote.

I sincerely hope we can turn this around and make a real change for our kids—so they can grow up breathing cleaner air.” His post comes on a day when Delhi woke up to a thick layer of smog.

However, the beauty queen was once insulted at the pageant as a Thai host questioned her intellect and called her a “dumbhead”. The Miss Universe contest was marred by ugly drama from this moment onwards, which spiralled into a walkout by pageant contestants and a tearful tantrum by the host. The off-stage antics of the coiffed contestants and their Thai hosts, escalated into a feminist firestorm, even drawing the attention of Mexico's president. Two judges also stepped down from the beauty pageant, with one of them accusing the contest of being rigged. At the very beginning of the beauty pageant, Fatima Bosch had staged a dramatic walkout in her evening gown and high heels. She was reportedly lambasted by Miss Universe host Nawat Itsaragrisil, who, during a livestream of the event, singled Miss Mexico out and called her a “dumbhead”. The episode reportedly occurred due to a dispute over Bosch's failure to post promotional content on her social media. Nawat denied using the term, but had called for security to intervene. Fatima Bosch then staged a walkout flanked by Miss Iraq, who wore a bejewelled floor-length robe. “What your director did is not respectful: he called me dumb,” Bosch told a press gaggle. “The world needs to see this because we are empowered women and this is a platform for our voice.” Other beauty queens had also risen in solidarity with Fatima, but froze as Nawat warned those still wanting to participate should “sit down”. The drama provoked a reaction from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum , who said Fatima Bosch was an \"example of how we women should speak out\" in the face of aggression. \"In public events, I say women look prettier when we speak out,\" she said. “So my recognition goes to this young woman.” Mexico's embassy in Thailand said on its Facebook page it is in \"constant communication\" with Fatima and her relatives.

The 25-year-old won the 74th annual competition held in Bangkok on Friday morning (Thursday night in the US), receiving the crown from Miss Universe 2024 Victoria Kjær Theilvig, Denmark’s first titleholder. The official Miss Universe account shared the exact moment Bosch was crowned, capturing her emotional reaction onstage. In the final lineup, Miss Thailand finished as first runner-up, followed by Miss Venezuela and Miss Philippines. Bosch’s win comes after weeks of turmoil surrounding this year’s competition. On 4 November, the opening day of Miss Universe 2025, she was involved in a heated exchange with Miss Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil during a sponsorship event — a moment that was livestreamed on the Miss Thailand Facebook page and quickly went viral. In response, Miss Universe president Raul Rocha announced that Itsaragrisil would be barred from attending future pageant events. Despite the statement, he was seen at multiple functions and even acknowledged during the live finale. The controversy deepened days before the finals when composer Omar Harfouch withdrew as a judge, alleging that the organisation had already selected the top 30 contestants through a “secret vote” that bypassed the official jury. “I felt honoured to be invited as an official judge,” he told Business Insider. “But everything changed when I discovered a parallel selection committee acting independently from the jury. It affected trust and credibility.”  In an Instagram statement issued on 18 November, the Miss Universe Organization said Omar Harfouch had misunderstood the purpose of a separate selection committee used for the pageant’s “Beyond the Crown Program,” which highlights the charitable work of contestants. “The Miss Universe Organization clarifies that this eight-person committee operates entirely independently from the official Miss Universe judging pa", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/watch-moment-mexico-s-f-tima-bosch-was-crowned-miss-universe-2025-amid-ongoing-pageant-drama-11763700893108.html", "timestamp": 1763728290.5195653}

Indian refineries are hurriedly seeking replacement supplies, booking oil tankers from the Middle East at a rate that has already elevated freight rates for the route to nearly a five-year high. Meanwhile, traders are closely looking for alternative purchasers, if any, for Lukoil and Rosneft crude that is already at sea, the report said. “ Russian export flows are holding up, but it’s not finding its way through to their destinations yet,” Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy for ING Groep NV, told the news portal. “If that continues and finally backs up all the way, we could start seeing supply falling, which will be a concern to markets.” The report cited data from analytics firm Kpler, which showed that nearly 48 million barrels of Rosneft and Lukoil crude, primarily Urals and ESPO grades, are currently in transit or being loaded. This includes around 50 tankers heading toward China and India, as well as others without a destination or aiming for smaller ports, spread across the Baltic to the South China Sea, as intermediaries try to distance themselves from the trade.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart.

From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms.
