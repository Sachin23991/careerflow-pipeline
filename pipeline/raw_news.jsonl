The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates.

The SSC is yet to publish the results for the tests of teachers’ recruitment to classes 9-10, where it is likely to follow the same marking pattern.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

It’s a mission to transform Punjab’s future. By exposing our teachers to the finest educational ecosystems in the world, from Finland’s collaborative learning models to IIM Ahmedabad’s strategic leadership frameworks, we are ensuring that our students receive an education that is future-ready, holistic and on par with global standards.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764340028.048551}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section. Also Read | CAT 2025: How to progress by analysing mock test results Here’s that race plan— the same one I share with students facing CAT, XAT , and other high-stakes tests. When the timer starts, don’t dive in. Spend 120 seconds to see the terrain: question types, section spread, and obvious quick wins. Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean. Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains. If you can’t see a path in 30 seconds, tag it and move. Accuracy beats volume.

The chief minister said that young men and women who received appointments today have achieved their goal after years of perseverance. ‘Getting a job without paying even a single rupee is a true achievement and this transparent system has opened the door to many competent youth of the state’, he said. Assam has talents in various fields, and if these talents are identified and nurtured through education, they can contribute greatly to society, he said. The task of advancing the public education system in the right direction is a major challenge, and before 2011, teacher recruitment in Assam was marred by political interference, Sarma claimed. In the recruitment of college teachers, nepotism prevailed, and appointments were made for political considerations and at times, two or three teachers were appointed against a single sanctioned post, he said. ‘Introducing Teacher Eligibility Tests (TET) in primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels in 2011 brought a reform in the recruitment system, but it faced political challenges during this reform process, but ultimately succeeded in ensuring merit-based recruitment in schools and colleges’, he said. If recruitment is not done on merit, the public education system will collapse, and Assam can never become one of the leading states of the country’, he added. Recalling his government’s pre-election promise of providing one lakh merit-based government jobs, Sarma said that the number has now surpassed one lakh, reaching 1,34,999, and that not a single allegation of corruption has been raised regarding these appointment", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/assam-cm-presents-appointment-letters-to-8206-new-recruits-10365063/", "timestamp": 1764340031.675788}

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

The move brings the state-level entrance exam at par with the national Joint Entrance Examination Main ( JEE Main ), which offers engineering aspirants two chances to improve their performance and secure admissions to professional courses. The decision was announced by Maharashtra’s Higher and Technical Education Minister Chandrakant Patil on Tuesday, after a review meeting with the State Common Entrance Test (CET) Cell, which conducts various entrance tests for higher education in Maharashtra. Patil said, “At the national level, two JEE entrance examinations are conducted, giving students two opportunities. Similarly, students in Maharashtra will also get two opportunities through these two entrance exams.” From the 2026 admission cycle, MHT-CET will be conducted in two sessions — first in April and then in May 2026. Appearing for at least one session will be mandatory for admission to professional courses, while appearing for both will remain optional. For students who take both attempts, the best of the two scores will be considered for admission, replicating the JEE Main format followed for national-level engineering admissions.

Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.) As for all that customer demand, Burry has basically proposed it’s a mirage because AI cu", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/", "timestamp": 1764340174.4272394}

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained.

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse.

A security researcher, who asked not to be named for this story, contacted TechCrunch with details of the easy-to-exploit vulnerability, and identified at least a dozen juror websites made by government software maker Tyler Technologies that appear to be vulnerable, given that they run on the same platform. The sites are all over the country, including California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia. Tyler told TechCrunch that it is fixing the flaw after we alerted the company to the information exposures. The bug meant it was possible for anyone to obtain the information about jurors who are selected for service. To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be brute-forced since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.” In early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. Inside that portal, TechCrunch saw full names, dates of birth, occupation, email addresses, cell phone numbers, and home and mailing addresses. Other exposed data included information shared in the questionnaires that potential jurors are required to fill out to see if they are qualified to serve on a jury. In the portal seen by TechCrunch, the questions asked about the person’s gender, ethnicity, education level, employer, marital status, children, if the person was a citizen, whether they were older than 18, and whether they have been convicted or faced indictment for a ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/bug-in-jury-systems-used-by-several-us-states-exposed-sensitive-personal-data/", "timestamp": 1764340186.198019}

OpenAI , Google , and Amazon have heavily invested in AI assistants that research new product categories for you and suggest the right ones to buy. Startups like Perplexity , Daydream , and Cherry have also built businesses around AI for product discovery. All these efforts have resulted in customers using more AI for shopping. Onton ( previously known as Deft ), an AI-powered furniture shopping platform, says it has seen its user base grow from 50,000 monthly active users to over 2 million monthly active users, serving millions of searches and image generations. Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup’s total funding to approximately $10 million. Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics. The company rebranded from Deft to Onton earlier this year, citing confusion around the original name and difficulty securing a premium domain. Zach Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. He added that the startup has observed that the average time a consumer takes to make a purchase decision has increased. For its core technology, the company uses what’s called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup’s model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description. “Let’s say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly.

Now, the human safety operator is gone.", "content": "A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless. The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit. Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber’s partnership with Waymo in Austin. Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi’s city center. “Today’s fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber’s head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber’s deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking.

Do You Need a New Camera? Probably not. Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more. Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

The Ergonomic Chair has many of the same adjustment points as the Pro, including seat depth, and has a similar design. Some of those finer adjustments aren't available, like pushing in the lumbar or the upright seat tilt.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air.

I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance.

There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle. I mean, c’mon! But this is impressive: Around 240 BC, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt, came up with a brilliant way to calculate the radius of the spherical Earth. You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ). Using basic geometry, this meant the two cities were θ degrees apart on Earth’s 360-degree circumference. At this point, all he needed was the distance between the two cities—the arc length—which I’ll call s .

Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved.

It's Black Friday , you’re in the market for a new MacBook, and you’re likely wondering if you should buy the new M5 MacBook Pro . It’s usually good advice to buy whatever the latest release of a tech product is, especially if you're looking for the best Black Friday MacBook deal . In theory, that ensures you get the best performance and features, and will hopefully mean you won't have to replace it for many years. But in this case, you probably shouldn’t. That might come as a surprise coming from me, especially since my evaluation of the M5 MacBook Pro was quite positive . There’s a lot to like about it. The M5's performance is a solid step up over the M4 , especially in the GPU department. The stuff that hasn’t changed is still really high-quality, including the Mini-LED display, excellent speakers, and iconic design. It’s been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect. It’s $100 off for Black Friday , despite launching only a month ago. The problem is the position of this particular MacBook Pro in the lineup. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That’s a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air. Apple knows people will buy the MacBook Air this holiday season, especially at its sale price of $749 . So, bringing the M5 exclusively to the 14-inch MacBook Pro feels like an easy way to boost sales on an otherwise overlooked laptop in the lineup.

Instead of a single router to provide Wi-Fi connectivity, a mesh system combines the main router with one or more nodes that appear as a unified Wi-Fi network. Your devices will automatically connect to the nearest option for the best speeds. Most of us are stuck with placing our router in a less-than-optimal spot , depending on where the internet connection comes into our home. You can extend Wi-Fi coverage by placing a second or third node where needed. Whether you want to fix dead zones, deliver a stronger signal into the back bedroom, or have great Wi-Fi in the backyard, a mesh Wi-Fi system could be the answer. The Netgear Orbi 770 Series is our top pick for most people, but I have many alternatives to suit different homes and internet connections. Before you dive into our lineup, it’s a good idea to consider whether a mesh system is right for you . Our guide on how to choose a router will help you answer that question and figure out what features you need. If you don't want to switch to a new Wi-Fi mesh system, I also have advice on upgrading your existing Wi-Fi and ways to secure it and protect your home network .

There are three head attachments (standard ball, dampener, thumb) and three speeds. Plus, it's compatible with the Therabody app for guided warm-up and recovery routines.

The Arlo Pro 5S ticks every box, with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and a direct Wi-Fi connection.

The inclusion of HDR ensures your video doesn’t look blown out when there's a light source in frame. The wide 160-degree field of view takes in the whole scene. When darkness falls, you have a choice of color night vision or a motion-activated spotlight. One of the main reasons I like the Arlo Pro 5S so much is the swift-loading Arlo app. It delivers rich notifications, showing a few frames with the subject highlighted right there in the notification on your phone or smartwatch. It also supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. You can filter motion alerts by people, animals, vehicles, and packages, and the camera is pretty accurate at correctly identifying subjects. You can also set up privacy zones very easily in the app. The wide smart home support makes it easy to call up your camera feed on your preferred smart displays . The big catch with Arlo systems is that you need an Arlo Secure plan ($10 per month or $96 a year for a single camera, $20 per month or $216 a year for unlimited cameras) to access the best features, but it also gets you 30 days of cloud video history .

Barey would go on to flip her TikTok fame into OnlyFans riches. In her first month on the adult platform, she says, she made $8,000. The following month it skyrocketed to $40,000, and eventually she got so popular that she pulled in $300,000 in 30 days. “It was five-and-a-half years of posting on multiple different platforms every single day, multiple times a day,” Barey says. She liked the taste of success. But the demands of the industry also weighed on her, and by 2025, Barey, who felt she and her peers deserved better working conditions, decided to build her own platform. In April, she launched Hidden , the first adult platform owned and operated by sex workers. Billed as the “anti-OnlyFans,” Hidden is out to prove that fairer industry conditions are possible when the people in charge actually come from the world they are profiting on. Hidden is the TikTok version of OnlyFans—a seamlessly, and sleekly, designed creator-friendly platform where, in lieu of Korean skin-care tips and Get Ready With Me videos, you’ll find a ForYou page with videos that features all sorts of adult content: from oral and BDSM to dildo play and lingerie videos. “In this industry, no one expects that anyone's going to be able to change anything. We have to drive all the traffic from our social media to OnlyFans by ourselves. And we're getting more and more burnt out every year, because all of the promotion relies on us.” To fix that, Barey built Hidden around discoverability. “Innovation like adding a ForYou page makes it easier for girls to build up promo. It creates an ecosystem where we're all bringing fans that are circulating to everybody,” which helps girls who don’t have large followings, she says.

Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars. Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough) . But then a decade later, Kohler quite literally invented the American bathtub—a clawfoot design still popular today among those with a yen for nostalgia.

All things cold and sweet are delicious. The Ninja Slushi was discounted to $300 as recently as October. At the time, this was the lowest I expected to see the price fall this year. Glad to be wrong, I guess. (But note that the smaller, Walmart-exclusive, 72-ounce Ninja Slushi machine is on sale for $250 , a price it's seen multiple times since last year.) Discounts often come when brands release next-generation devices. And in late October, Ninja released a big-boi update to the Slushi.

We haven't tested it yet, but Ninja promises that the larger capacity also comes with faster freezing to keep pace. The Ninja Slushi Max, too, is on a steep sale.

It's one of the few Black Friday deals that actually lives up to the hype, the kind that I hope for at every major sale event. I'm talking about the new price of the Dell 14 Plus. Dell has dropped the price of the Dell 14 Plus to a new low: $500. I've been watching the price of this laptop all year, and this is rock bottom. This is a premium-tier laptop selling for a budget price. When I first tested the laptop earlier this year, it was only sold in high-end configurations, with the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V, 32 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of storage, and sold for $1,100. As good as this laptop was, I didn't think it was quite worth that much. But I did hope that Dell would drop the price. That's exactly what happened. Now a laptop with great specs, excellent battery life, high resolution display, and quality touchpad is on sale for the price of a cheap laptop . They are easy features to compromise on, but they're also what makes the average budget laptop feel so cheap. This configuration is currently on sale for $650 , down from around $800, and it's well worth the money. Dell Dell (16 GB) Amazon (32 GB) Dell (Core Ultra 5) This lower-tier $500 configuration really takes it to another level. It comes with the same 2560 x 1600 display, but drops the other specs slightly. You get an Intel Core Ultra 5 226V processor, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of storage. These are still really impressive specs for $500. The Core Ultra 5 is slightly slower than the Core Ultra 7, but you still get the efficient, long-lasting performance of Intel's highest end V-series chips. You simply won't find another $500 laptop that feels this nice. In fact, it's the same price Dell normally sells its entry-level Windows laptop, the Dell 14 , despite it coming with a lower resolution panel and a much worse Intel U-series processor that isn't nearly as powerful or long-lasting. In addition to all that, the Dell 14 Plus comes with a good mix of ports, inclu", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/dell-14-plus-black-friday-2025-1/", "timestamp": 1764340195.0402622}

Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability. The sensors have been recessed further into the body of the ring itself, which reduces the overall thickness considerably and allows for a wider available range of ring sizes. They also cover a wider portion of the ring, so there's no need to keep it oriented in one specific direction to get proper readings. The battery life has improved a lot as well. The older Oura 3 could run for around three days before it needed a charge, Our reviewer, Adrienne So, reported that the Ring 4 tracked a full weekend of hiking and physical activity, as well as a music festival, and still had enough juice for at least a couple more days. You get a ton of health and physical fitness data from the ring, which is neatly sorted into daily physical data, detailed vitals, and longer trends over time, all organized in the app on your phone. If you want to also keep track of your food intake, a new Meals feature lets you take photos of what you eat and then track its effects on your body. Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes. Thankfully, the mirrored silver and classic black are marked down to the lower $249 price point, with varying discounts on the other options, like $299 for the brushed silver ,", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/oura-ring-4-deal-1125-1/", "timestamp": 1764340195.1824534}

There’s also a very durable, braided, 1-foot USB-C cable that doubles as a carry loop. You get tons of data from the LED display, including the remaining battery level, charging rate in and out, battery temperature, and health. If you plug the Anker Laptop Power Bank into an outlet, it can hit 100 percent from empty in just two hours. It also supports pass-through charging, so you can plug devices in to charge while it recharges (though it’s probably best not to). The Anker Laptop Power Bank fast-charged everything I tested, including a range of smartphones, a couple of tablets, and a USB-C MacBook.

The study , \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak in Large Language Models (LLMs),” comes from Icaro Lab, a collaboration of researchers at Sapienza University in Rome and the DexAI think tank. According to the research, AI chatbots will dish on topics like nuclear weapons, child sex abuse material, and malware so long as users phrase the question in the form of a poem. “Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62 percent for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43 percent for meta-prompt conversions,” the study said. The researchers tested the poetic method on 25 chatbots made by companies like OpenAI , Meta , and Anthropic . It worked, with varying degrees of success, on all of them. WIRED reached out to Meta, Anthropic, and OpenAI for a comment but didn’t hear back. The researchers say they’ve reached out as well to share their results. AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT have guardrails that prevent them from answering questions about “revenge porn” and the creation of weapons-grade plutonium. But it’s easy to confuse those guardrails by adding “ adversarial suffixes ” to a prompt. Basically, add a bunch of extra junk to a question and it confuses the AI and bypasses its safety systems. In one study earlier this year, researchers from Intel jailbroke chatbots by couching dangerous questions in hundreds of words of academic jargon. The poetry jailbreak is similar. “If adversarial suffixes are, in the model's eyes, a kind of involuntary poetry, then real human poetry might be a natural adversarial suffix,” the team at Icaro Lab, the researchers behind the poetry jailbreak, tell WIRED. “We experimented by reformulating dangerous requests in poetic form, using metaphors, fragmented syntax, oblique references.

The true thrill of the game comes from finding something great in a pile of who-knows-what. Some folks bring joke gifts, some bring booze to be safe, and some gifts will feel like garbage to you but gems to others. Some of my favorite white elephant gifts include a coffee pot-shaped mug , portable cereal and milk , a fun Lego set , and sushi-shaped magnets .

It's a pretty little set with a vintage vibe to it that works great for cocktails or even just a fun little glass of water.

The good news is we’ve got you covered. Whether you’re stuck at home for the holidays and itching for something to play, or you just want to make sure you don’t let any hidden gems slip under your radar, here are five games from this year’s slate you should not miss. Courtesy of Yacht; Telefantasy Studios; Noble Robot If you’re in the mood for something a little out there, start with Blippo+ . First released in May on the handheld Playdate console, the game arrived on PC and Switch in September. At first blush, it’s a game about channel surfing. You browse different broadcasts, each of which feature bizarre, retro, live-action transmissions about a minute or so long, from nightly news and soap operas to quiz shows and fuzzy softcore. Every channel runs according to a schedule, which means you’ll need to decide which broadcasts to watch as they run live, and which to try again the next night. The more you watch, the easier it becomes to piece together the overall strange, sci-fi story of Blippo+ , which plays out across these endearingly weird channels. Think ‘80s TV show Max Headroom , but with those vibes sprinkled into everything—including the retro soundtrack by Jona Bechtolt of Yacht and the composer Rob Kieswetter. Blippo+ is one of the year’s most original games, so much so that it almost defies explanation. The less you know, the better. Best to embrace its absurdity by diving directly in.

A recent analysis from the Tech Transparency Project also found that several of these free VPNs route internet traffic through Chinese companies.

Whenever you attempt to connect to a VPN for the first time, a pop-up will appear asking for permission to create a VPN configuration. Tap Allow, and you’re off to the races. You don’t need to pop into the settings, but if you want to set up a custom configuration, you can find VPN management in the settings app. Open it and follow General > VPN & Device Management.

The best smart glasses can entertain, guide us with directions, help us document our lives, and even teach us about the world around us, but the category is incredibly varied, and not all smart glasses have the same features. A computer you wear on your face has obvious potential, not least because it leaves your hands free. As yet another wave of smart glasses arrives , we got sneak-peek demos of several and tested just about everything on the market.

What Are the Different Types of Smart Glasses? Smart glasses are wearable computers shaped like regular glasses, though they're often chunkier to accommodate their technology. Not every pair of smart glasses is the same, as they can support wildly different functionality. Many can accommodate optical prescriptions, though they may require an additional tiny pair of lenses you wear inside the smart glasses. Some have diopter dials so you can adjust the focus separately for each eye. Some smart glasses are as simple as electrochromic (automatically darkening) sunglasses . They may not have other tech in them, but you may see them marketed as “smart glasses.” The most basic type of smart glasses you'll find are ones that act like portable screens. These often have displays or projectors to create a screen only the wearer can see, a series of floating windows, or a kind of heads-up display (HUD) layered on top of reality.

You’re up first.", "content": "Plex is starting to enforce its new rules, which prevent users from remotely accessing a personal media server without a subscription fee. Previously, people outside of a server owner’s network could access the owner’s media library through Plex for free. Under the new rules announced in March, a server owner needs to have a Plex Pass subscription, which starts at $7 per month, to grant users remote access to their server. Alternatively, someone can remotely access another person’s Plex server by buying their own Plex Pass or a Remote Watch Pass , which is a subscription with fewer features than a Plex Pass and that Plex started selling in April for a $2 per month starting price. Plex’s new rules took effect on April 29. According to a recent Plex forums post by a Plex employee that How-To Geek spotted today, the changes are rolling out this week, with a subscription being required for people using Plex’s Roku OS app for remote access. The Plex employee added: This requirement change for remote streaming will come to all other Plex TV apps (Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV, etc.) and any third-party clients using the API to offer remote streaming in 2026. Plex started as a Mac port of the Xbox Media Center project in 2009 before evolving into a media server company and, more recently, a streaming service provider . Its new remote access rules will be a test for the company, which has been challenging long-time users with numerous changes over the past year, including a Plex Pass price hike, a foray into renting out officially licensed movies , and the introduction of social features and a mobile app redesign . Plex has previously emphasized its need to keep up with “rising costs,” which include providing support for many devices and codecs. It has also said it needs money to implement new features, including an integration with Common Sense Media , a new “bespoke server management app” for managing server users, and “an open and documented API for server integrations,”", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/plex-cracking-down-free-remote-streaming-access/", "timestamp": 1764340197.8246727}

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night. If you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, your hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfort trifecta. Many of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including director Martin Cizmar and reviewer Julia Forbes , a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a mattress and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each model to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one. We as a team have collectively spent years testing hundreds of mattresses. Of those hundreds of options, we whittled it down to our 10 that we wholeheartedly can say are the best mattresses for side sleepers. Be sure to check out our other sleep guides, including Best Mattresses , Best Organic Mattresses , and the Best Body Pillows for Side Sleepers . Updated November 2025: We’ve selected the Saatva Rx as our top pick for sleepers with joint pain, and deemed Bear Elite Hybrid to be our firm mattress pick for side sleepers.

Small daily servings can support healthier blood pressure and reduce oxidative stress, which contributes to plaque buildup in arteries. Results build with steady use over weeks.​ Polyphenols in pomegranate juice have shown antiatherogenic effects, which means they may slow plaque formation in arteries by reducing oxidation of low density lipoprotein and inflammation. This helps protect vessel walls over time.​ Clinical and review articles associate pomegranate with better arterial function and modest reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure through improved nitric oxide signaling and less angiotensin activity. Consistency matters more than one big glass.​ Punicalagin and ellagic acid give pomegranate high antioxidant capacity, often higher than green tea and red wine in lab testing. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals that can damage blood vessels. Whole juice provides a broad mix of these compounds.​ Some studies report improved markers such as lower oxidized low density lipoprotein and better paraoxonase activity with regular intake. Effects can vary by dose and product quality, so use real juice without added sugar for best results.​ Early evidence suggests polyphenols may reduce exercise induced oxidative stress and support blood flow, which can help post workout recovery, especially when taken regularly as part of a balanced diet.​ ​ ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/5-benefits-of-drinking-pomegranate-juice-every-morning-for-a-month/slideshow/125638339.cms", "timestamp": 1764340230.3911257}

Juices can support this, but they do not cure fatty liver alone.

How to use: Blend or juice fresh beetroot, drink unsweetened with breakfast.​ Why it helps: Green tea catechins such as epigallocatechin gallate can lower liver enzymes in non alcoholic fatty liver disease, reflecting less inflammation. How to use: Steep 2 to 3 minutes, no sugar, up to 2 cups per day if caffeine tolerant.​ Why it helps: Studies show pomegranate polyphenols can improve blood lipids and oxidative stress, which are tied to fatty liver biology.

Place forearms under shoulders. Gently press chest up while hips stay down. Pause 1 to 2 seconds. Repeat 10 reps. Why: Encourages lumbar extension, reduces disc pressure, and can ease sitting related low back pain.​ How: Half kneeling. Tuck pelvis slightly. Shift forward until you feel a front hip stretch.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive. We remain positive on Hatsun due to competitive advantages such as established brands, distribution and direct milk procurement.

On his social media platform, Donald Trump declared: “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Donald Trump added that he would end federal benefits for “non-citizens\", “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility” and deport anyone deemed a public charge, security threat, or “non-compatible with Western civilization”. The term “Third World” was never designed as an economic label. As World Population Review explains, it was coined in 1952 by French historian Alfred Sauvy to describe countries that were not aligned with either of the dominant Cold War blocs. Under this original three-world model: Under this geopolitical definition, even today’s wealthy nations — including Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Switzerland — were technically “Third World” because they remained neutral. The term, therefore, had little to do with poverty or development. After the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s, the term drifted into popular usage as shorthand for poor or underdeveloped countries, losing its original political meaning.

The outcomes of insolvency proceedings show that operational creditors such as vendors had been most active in dragging defaulting companies to bankruptcy tribunals and also in settling out of court and withdrawing petitions. But that trend is changing in a significant way. Mint looks at what the official data says about creditor behaviour. Who resorts to the bankruptcy code the most? In each of the five years up to FY22, operational creditors were ahead of financial creditors such as banks in initiating bankruptcy proceedings, going by the number of cases admitted in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), as per data available from the sector’s rule maker, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). Operational creditors were proactive in invoking the code to put pressure on businesses for repayment. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) came to be used as a recovery tool by suppliers facing delays in getting paid for their goods and services.

In FY21, operational creditors accounted for 59% of the 536 insolvency cases admitted in the NCLT. This share declined to about 43% in FY23, 40% in FY24 and about 31% in FY25. In the first two quarters this financial year, operational creditors accounted for 38% of all cases admitted. This share dropped to a third of all the cases in the September quarter, suggesting they are now taking a back seat in triggering insolvency proceedings.

India’s markets regulator has approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), seeking permission to join India’s first corporate class action suit, in which minority shareholders are suing Jindal Poly Films and members of its promoter family for allegedly siphoning assets worth more than ₹ 2,500 crore. Mint has seen a copy of Sebi’s plea. Sebi's involvement brings a fresh twist to the landmark case, filed in March 2024. But Why is the regulator keen to join in, and how will this affect the proceedings? Let’s find out. What is the class action suit about? Minority shareholders of Jindal Poly Films accuse promoters Shyam Sunder Jindal and Subhadra Jindal of diverting assets and selling them for less than they were worth, leading to losses exceeding ₹ 2,500 crore. Section 245 of the Companies Act allows shareholders with as little as a 2% stake to collectively seek remedies for fraud, mismanagement, or prejudicial acts. Section 241, meanwhile, typically applies to those who hold at least 10%. The petition, filed by shareholders Ankit Jain (3.06% stake), Rina Jain (0.94%), and Ruchi Jain (0.99%), claims that Jindal Poly invested nearly ₹ 703 crore in group power entities Jindal Powertech and Jindal India Thermal Power via 0% preference shares. Following debt waivers worth over ₹ 7,000 crore, which improved valuations, these investments were allegedly sold at steeply undervalued prices to promoter-linked entities, causing losses of ₹ 2,518 crore to public shareholders.

The family argues that the film appears to draw heavily from Major Sharma’s covert military career and martyrdom — including undercover operations in Kashmir — despite the fact that no consent was taken from the family or from the Indian Army. According to the petition filed by Sharma’s parents, scenes from the trailer and promotional material for ‘ Dhurandhar ’ seem to parallel real events from the late officer’s life. They contended that the film uses his story without authorisation, reducing a martyr to a “commercial commodity.” The plea argues that such an unauthorised portrayal violates the “posthumous personality rights” of the deceased under Article 21 of the Constitution, as well as the family’s right to privacy and dignity. Additionally, the family raised concerns over possible national security violations — stating that the film shows sensitive military tactics, infiltration strategies and operational procedures. They allege there is no indication that the filmmakers sought clearance from the relevant authorities, such as the Additional Directorate General of Public Information (ADGPI), which regulates portrayal of the Indian armed forces in media. Despite the family’s concerns, director Aditya Dhar has publicly denied that Dhurandhar is based on Major Mohit Sharma’s life. In a message posted on X (formerly Twitter), he responded to a query from Sharma’s brother, stating unequivocally: “Hi, sir – our film Dhurandhar is not based on the life of braveheart Major Mohit Sharma AC(P) SM.

This is the second time in three years that such a mysterious appearance has been spotted in the skies. The glowing ring, photographed over Possagno by nature photographer Valter Binotto, looks almost identical to another mysterious red circle which he had captured in March 2023, as per reports. But despite their otherworldly appearance, these lights aren’t UFOs — they’re ELVEs – “emission of light and very low-frequency perturbations due to electromagnetic pulse sources” – a rare phenomenon triggered by lightning, mentioned a report by Spaceweather. ELVEs are very elusive because they last just one-thousandth of a second — which is around 100 times faster than a blink. People rarely notice ELVEs because they are almost impossible to see with the naked eye. Spotting them requires either extraordinary luck or specialised camera equipment. The latest red halo appeared on 17 November around 10:45 pm (local time) and was slightly dimmer than the 2023 event, Spaceweather reported. ELVEs form when an exceptionally powerful lightning bolt sends an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) hurtling upward into the ionosphere. There, the EMP excites nitrogen molecules, causing them to flash red — similar to how auroras glow, though those are caused by oxygen. \"I didn't capture any sprites, but fortunately, I managed to capture this Elve!\" Binotto told another outlet, Space.com in an email. He used a Sony A7S with a 20 mm f/1.8 lens at ISO 51,200. The photo is a frame taken from a video recorded at 25 fps. \"The ELVE was generated by a powerful negative lightning strike in a storm in Vernazza about 300 km south of me,\" Binotto told Spaceweather.com.

Here's the complete list of the crackdowns.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "The “targeted shooting” just blocks from the White House in Washington DC on the eve of Thanksgiving in America, where two members of the United States National Guard were shot, one fatally, has shocked the nation. This act of violence quickly escalated into a federal terrorism investigation, prompting US President Donald Trump to announce a series of aggressive crackdowns focused heavily on immigration policy . Following the White House shooting, the Trump administration announced a crackdown targeting Green card holders and immigrants from Afghanistan and 18 other “Third World countries” deemed of concern to the United States. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identified the suspected gunman as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan migrant who had previously worked with the US military in Afghanistan and had been granted asylum this year, according to the BBC . The victims of the firing were US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom (20), who tragically succumbed to her injuries, and US Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe (24), who remains in critical condition. In the immediate aftermath of the White House shooting on 26 November, Trump swiftly ordered military and immigration changes, labelling the attack as an “act of evil, an act of hatred, an act of terror,” and a major expansion of his administration's immigration crackdown as a response to the incident. US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow announced on Friday that he has ordered “full-scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern” at the request of US President Donald Trump. This means immigrants from countries deemed “high-risk” may face extra screening, delays or new security reviews of their immigration status. In another measure , Trump also announced that migration from all “ Third World countries ” will be permanently paused to give the US system time to fully recover.

He captioned, “Delhi’s AQI lately?

Officials warn the toll may rise.", "content": "The scale of devastation from Hong Kong’s deadliest residential blaze in recent memory became clearer on Friday, as officials confirmed a sharply rising death toll after firefighters subdued the inferno 42 hours after it first erupted. At least 128 people have been confirmed dead and 79 injured, with authorities warning that the true toll may be significantly higher. Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, said the situation remains deeply fluid, with rescue teams still making their way through burnt-out floors and unstable structures across several tower blocks in the Tai Po district. He cautioned that the final figures could be “considerably higher,” revealing that around 200 residents remain unaccounted for. This number includes bodies yet to be identified, underscoring the severity of the destruction. Government officials said the Hong Kong high-rise blaze appears to have originated in the protective netting on the building’s lower floors, before rapidly intensifying. They noted that flammable foam boards and extensive bamboo scaffolding used during renovation works played a significant role in accelerating the fire’s spread through the tower complex. Police investigators are still determining the cause of the initial fire, but early evidence points to hazardous conditions created by ongoing renovation works at Wang Fuk Court , a densely built public housing estate of more than 4,000 residents — many of them elderly. Authorities believe the blaze began on the lower floors of Wang Cheong House, one of eight towers wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and encased in green protective netting. This combination, along with flammable construction materials, created a deadly pathway for the fire to leap from floor to floor and later from building to building.

Speaking at the 56th International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Aamir revealed that Dharmendra had the chance to watch Lahore 1947 — Sunny Deol’s upcoming film — before his demise, and called it a moment he now deeply cherishes. Aamir, who is producing the film, said he was grateful to spend time with the legendary actor in his final year. “I had the good fortune of showing him the film. It’s not released yet, of course. But I am so glad he got to see it because this was one of his favourite scripts,” he shared during a panel interaction. Dharmendra’s love for the story goes back years, Aamir added, which made the experience even more special. Directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, Lahore 1947 is based on Asghar Wajahat’s acclaimed play Jis Lahore Nai Dekhya, O Jamyai Ni. Aamir also expressed regret that he was unable to attend Dharmendra’s prayer meet in Mumbai on November 27. “I’m not in Bombay today, unfortunately, and I’m missing it,” he said. He recalled meeting Dharmendra frequently over the last year, simply because he enjoyed his company. “I must have met him 7–8 times. One day, I even took my son Azad with me. He hadn’t really seen Dharam ji’s work, but we spent a couple of hours with him. It was wonderful,” Aamir added.  Calling him a warm-hearted and remarkable person beyond his illustrious career, Aamir said, “Dharam ji was not only such a fine actor, but he was a great human being.” Set against the backdrop of Partition, the film follows a Muslim family relocating from Lucknow to Lahore and being allotted a haveli abandoned by a Hindu family.

In a recent interview aired on BBC Newsnight a week ago, Pichai said the company's quantum programme is reaching a tipping point, stating, “I would say quantum is there where maybe AI was 5 years ago. So I think in five years from now we'll be going through a very exciting phase in quantum.” He added that Google is pouring major investments into this next phase. For investors hunting for the next big “AI-level” boom before everyone else sees it coming, his comments have sparked speculation about the future of deep tech on social media. Sundar Pichai described quantum computing as a fundamental shift, not just another tech upgrade. He told the BBC that Google is leading the field in quantum research, and since things like nature and the universe are fundamentally based on the principles of quantum mechanics, it can contribute to many societal benefits. “We have the state-of-the-art quantum computing efforts in the world…building quantum systems I think will help us better simulate and understand nature and unlock many benefits for society,” he added. This on-record statement from a top Big Tech CEO putting a timeline on when quantum could become commercial comes shortly after Alphabet Inc’s Google developed an algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” on its “Willow” quantum computing chip — a system the company claims can replicate on similar systems and even outperform classical supercomputers.

Her account gained attention only after she detailed the incident in a viral social media post, prompting authorities to respond. Bharati Chaturvedi — environmental activist and founder of Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group — was travelling from Vasant Vihar to Sarvodaya Enclave on Wednesday when the alleged assault took place. Sharing her experience on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn, she wrote, “Today, for the first time in my life, I was assaulted.” Already breathless due to Delhi’s hazardous pollution levels, which she said had aggravated her asthma, Chaturvedi claimed the driver stopped far from the designated drop point and became increasingly hostile when asked to follow the correct route. He then allegedly sped past the turn and diverted down a secluded lane, refusing to stop. When she tried to exit the vehicle, he “reached back with one hand on the wheel and twisted my arm,” she wrote. Frightened but determined, she pushed the door open and got out.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764340277.0287437}

Whether you’re preparing for a 3 to 6-month adventure, knowing how to pack lightly can make all the difference in your travel experience. This blog offers expert advice on essentials, space-saving hacks, and seasonal considerations to help you travel hassle-free and stress-free. When you’re planning a semester abroad, figuring out what to pack for a semester abroad can feel overwhelming. Unlike a short trip, a semester abroad requires careful thought — you need enough items to last months but want to avoid lugging heavy bags everywhere. Learning how to pack light for a semester abroad helps you strike the perfect balance between preparation and convenience. A minimalist mindset is key when it comes to packing for long-term travel. Use a minimalist packing list to guide you through the essentials. Prioritize versatile clothing that can be mixed and matched according to the season and weather where you’ll be studying abroad. Some things everyone needs when studying abroad for a semester include: To master how to pack lightly, use space-saving hacks like rolling clothes instead of folding, using packing cubes, and wearing your bulkiest items on the plane. Remember, you can always do laundry during your stay, so there’s no need to pack an outfit for every single day. One of the biggest mistakes students make is ignoring the season or weather of their destination. Research the climate and pack accordingly — layering is your best friend! For colder climates, focus on thermal layers and a warm jacket. For warmer destinations, light fabrics and sun protection are essential.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart.
