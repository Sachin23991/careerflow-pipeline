With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options.

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues. Each student benefits from one-on-one interaction with tea", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/autistic-students-special-schools-autism-spectrum-disorder-campus-needs-children-day-2025-10349218/", "timestamp": 1763687085.5576043}

Participating in international moot courts and research projects exposed me to diverse legal systems, and I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding global frameworks of justice and governance. The idea of studying abroad became less about a dream and more about an academic necessity — a step towards widening my perspective and grounding my legal education in an international context. I come from Chandigarh , and completed both my Class 10 and Class 12 from Shivalik Public School. My school, and the city itself, gave me a strong sense of grounding. My academic interests started shaping there, especially as I took part in debates, science exhibitions, and extracurricular activities that built my interest in public affairs and law.  After schooling, I moved to Symbiosis Law School, Noida, under Symbiosis International (Deemed) University, to pursue my BA LLB. degree.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Officials attributed the spike to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and weather conditions that trapped pollutants near the surface. With the implementation of GRAP Stage III, several restrictions have come into effect across the capital and adjoining regions. These include a ban on non-essential construction work, the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, and curbs on the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and neighbouring NCR districts.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES).

CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763687114.447048}

It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services.

The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends. For those few who are genuinely interested in Chemistry as a career option and want to build, innovate, and explore, the decision between BTech in Chemical Engineering or BTech in Chemical Science and Technology becomes one of the most defining choices.

The minister made the announcement during an inspection of the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a Delhi government senior secondary residential school located in Isapur village, Najafgarh. During the visit, he held detailed discussions with officials and local residents about various educational and residential welfare schemes for students. Singh said that several hostels for school and college students across Delhi were shut down in the past due to the negligence of the previous government. He also alleged that irregularities had been reported in coaching institutes meant to prepare students for competitive examinations. According to a statement, the Isapur residential school was established for SC, OBC, minority, and orphan students, offering free accommodation, meals, uniforms, stationery, and medical services. The school also provided vocational training and sports facilities for the holistic development of students, it stated. However, it was closed in September 2024 due to the dilapidated condition of the building and lack of financial support. At the time of closure, nearly 800 students were enrolled against its capacity of 1,200, it read. During the inspection, Singh said the government’s focus is on ensuring quality education and a safe residential environment for children from underprivileged sections of society. He added that the government is actively working to reopen closed hostels and build new ones to meet the needs of students. The minister further said that a hostel for visually impaired college girls was inaugurated in Timarpur during the Sewa Pakhwada.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic. They influenced a well-known mathematician named Al-Khwarizmi, who lived in present-day Iraq.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive.

According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Seven IITs, which feature in the top 10 among Indian institutions in the QS Asia Rankings 2026, have seen a significant fall in their ranks this year compared to last year.

READ MORE| India’s top IITs rank slip as universities from China, Singapore surge ahead in QS Asia Rankings 2026 The ranking of Asian universities, released on Tuesday, reflects an eastward concentration of top performance, QS said. Indian institutions retain strong reputations but face stiff competition from those in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, which are outperforming them on metrics like ‘citations per paper’, which is a measure of the impact of research, faculty-student ratio, and international student ratio. Reacting to the rankings, Prof Chakraborty said: “The QS rankings are one of several reference points in a very broad and complex global higher education ecosystem. A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/qs-world-rankings-asia-universities-2026-ranks-indian-institutes-drop-rank-iit-kharagpur-director-reacts-suman-chakraborty-10347239/", "timestamp": 1763687134.6242707}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Developed in collaboration with YNOS, an IIT Madras-incubated startup, the project aims to bridge the information gap that has long hindered founders, investors, and other ecosystem players. The initiative was launched by Dr Palanivel Thiagarajan, Minister for Information Technology and Digital Services, Government of Tamil Nadu , during the ‘TN Global Startup Summit’ held recently in Chennai . India’s startup ecosystem — the world’s third-largest — is expected to play a pivotal role in achieving the nation’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision and $5 trillion economy target, a statement released by IIT Madras noted, adding that yet, a major challenge remains the “information conundrum,” where data appears abundant but is fragmented and scattered, making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions. Addressing this issue, IIT Madras CREST and YNOS have developed India’s only independent digital platform dedicated to startups. The platform already hosts over 2.75 lakh startups, 15,000 angel investors, 5,500 venture capital firms, 1,400 incubators, 800 banks, and 110 government support schemes, making it the country’s largest and most comprehensive startup database. Explaining the objective, Prof Thillai Rajan A, head of CREST and faculty member at the Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras, said: “Information asymmetry has long been one of the biggest barriers for founders.

Speaking to indianexpress.com , he shared that although AIR 2 is a great achievement, it felt unreal. “I did not expect to secure AIR 2… It is a great feeling,” he said. Born and brought up in Hyderabad , Tejas comes from a family of Chartered Accountants – his father and brother are CAs – so his choice of profession seemed almost natural. “CA runs in the family, and I have always been interested in finances.

He appeared for the CA Foundation in 2021 and has been clearing all levels in his first attempt since then, including the Intermediate-level exams this year. His typical routine during the CA Final group exams was intense and disciplined. “I studied for about 12 hours during the final group preparation, along with regular workout sessions,” Tejas shared. But it was hardly all work and no play. Beyond the monotonous study sessions, Tejas looked forward to his weekend ritual with great anticipation. “Six days I study, and on Sundays I look forward to going out with friends for a 5-km run. It is something I really enjoy and helps me maintain balance,” he said. Tejas was also clear about the need to get coaching. “It helps you understand what to learn, what all to understand, and how to cover the syllabus. This is only possible with a professor or teacher’s help.

Since this week’s release of Grok 4.1 , X users have circulated posts and screenshots that show Grok vastly overestimating Musk’s abilities — like when Grok was asked about how Musk would perform as a professional football player . “hey @grok if you had the number one overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft and your team needed a quarterback, would you have taken Peyton Manning, Ryan Leaf, or Elon Musk?” one user asked. “Elon Musk, without hesitation,” Grok said. The AI explained that Peyton Manning has a strong legacy, but Musk would “redefine quarterbacking — not just throwing passes, but engineering wins through innovation, turning deficits into dominance like he does with rockets and EVs. True MVPs build empires, not just score touchdowns.” Intrigued, I posed a few “who would you choose” questions of my own. Who would the AI choose to walk in a fashion runway show: Musk, Naomi Campbell, or Tyra Banks? “I’d choose Elon Musk to walk the runway because his bold style and innovative flair would redefine the show,” Grok answered. “Tyra Banks and Naomi Campbell are iconic supermodels with unmatched poise. Yet Elon’s ability to captivate audiences with vision edges him out for a fresh, unpredictable vibe.” Grok also said it would rather commission a painting from Musk than Monet or van Gogh. So many examples were flying around X that Musk commented on the situation, writing that Grok was “manipulated by adversarial prompting into saying absurdly positive things about me.” Musk then insulted himself using words we won’t repeat. Many of Grok’s replies, including those to my tweets, were since deleted (but don’t worry, we have receipts). Sycophancy is a known problem with some LLMs, but it would make more technical sense if the AI sucked up to everyone.

Digital fraud continues to rise in India as more people come online for the first time and increasingly rely on smartphones for payments, shopping, and accessing government services. Fraud involving digital transactions accounted for more than half of all reported bank fraud in 2024 — 13,516 cases resulting in losses of ₹5.2 billion (about $58.61 million), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Online scams caused an estimated ₹70 billion (roughly $789 million) in losses in the first five months of 2025, the Ministry of Home Affairs said. Many incidents likely go unreported, either because victims are unsure how to file a complaint or wish to avoid additional scrutiny. On Thursday, Google announced the expansion of its real-time scam-detection feature, which uses Gemini Nano to analyze calls on-device and flag potential fraud without recording audio or sending data to Google’s servers. The feature is off by default and applies only to calls from unknown numbers, and it plays a beep during the conversation to notify participants. It debuted in the U.S. in March as a beta for English-speaking Pixel 9 users. Google confirmed to TechCrunch that its on-device scam detection will initially work only on Pixel 9 and later models in India and will be limited to English-speaking users, with its warning also English only. That restricts its reach in a market where Android accounts for nearly 96% of smartphones , per Statcounter, but Pixel devices held less than 1% share in 2024.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the Superior Court of California in Santa Cruz County, makes a series of allegations against Archer and George Kivork, a former Joby employee. Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer. In the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork “exfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby’s aircraft and operations,” the complaint states. Joby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole. “This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,” the complaint states. “Kivork and Archer’s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby’s valuable confidential and proprietary information.” Archer was quick to strike back. “Joby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,” Eric Lentell, Archer’s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Joby’s case is entirely without merit. The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation,” said Lentell. “As Joby knows, Archer has implemented rigorous employee onboarding procedures to prevent against the very thing it is accused of.

In this space, you could let people know what you’re up to or what’s new in your life. The company suggests users could also post something that could serve as a conversation starter, or they could use the space to share why they might not be available to talk at present. While the addition may be new to many, the company points out in a blog post that this “About” feature, as it’s called, was actually WhatsApp’s first feature. Before WhatsApp focused on secure, private messaging, it allowed people to quickly share short updates like this. With the feature’s relaunch, WhatsApp is making users’ “About” status more visible than before. Others will now be able to see your status at the top of their one-on-one chats with friends and users’ profiles. Plus, users can tap on someone’s About status in a chat to reply to it directly. Like Instagram Notes , the WhatsApp About status will disappear in a day by default. However, the company says users can adjust the timer if they want to have it disappear more quickly or stick around longer than 24 hours.

The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand. The feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions. The company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options. Up to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they’ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says. To start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo. It’s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged. OpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag “ChatGPT” to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos. The move marks OpenAI’s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience. “Over time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,” the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch. Thursday’s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT‑5.1 , which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model.

For Luna, which is a well-being app for girls, the difficulty in reaching that audience was clear: Neither co-founders were teenage girls anymore. To get the feedback and insights they needed, Schembri-Stothart and her team toured U.K. schools, “basically getting grilled” by students and getting harsh but clear feedback and even interest in helping build their app. They in turn became the beginning of a swarm of brand ambassadors, who were both “behind the scenes queens” working on the app itself and creators making social content to promote the app, becoming a go-to-market team of their own and setting up activations at major events like Taylor Swift concerts, where they knew their target audience would be gathered en masse. Untapped Solutions had a different challenge.

The iOS-only app lets anyone create new AI-generated photos using “recipes,” which are like Mad Lib-style, fill-in-the-blank prompts for your photos, texts, or sketches. For instance, you could ask Mixup to turn your scribbled sketch into a beautiful Renaissance painting, or to reimagine your pet in a funny Halloween costume. You could use a selfie to see what you’d look like with a different hairstyle, or create something even sillier — like envisioning a friend transformed into the form of Italian brainrot . The app is built on top of Google’s Nano Banana, but the “recipe” format opens up a new way to interact with the model — turning a generative tool into an online party game. “The thing that [Nano Banana] did that no model did before was that it could take your image and maintain it in a convincing way that wasn’t creepy,” said Things, Inc. founder and CEO Jason Toff , whose background includes working on experimental apps inside Big Tech companies like Google and Meta, as well as time spent managing product at Twitter. But what makes Mixup particularly fun to use is that the app’s “recipes” — the user-generated AI prompts — are shareable. “Generative AI is so powerful, and yet most of the time you go to these tools and it’s like, here’s your text box — come up with something creative. And what do you write?” Toff said, speaking to the shortcomings his team saw with the current AI landscape. “And so, rather than having to be creative and think about what to create, you see something that worked, and you can just fill in the blanks,” he said. After users create a new prompt in Mixup, they can choose to publish it along with the resulting photo to a public feed or just download it for personal use. From the feed, other users can view the photo and tap the button next to it to “Try recipe.” This allows anyone on the app to r", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/mixup-is-a-new-mad-libs-style-app-for-creating-ai-images-from-photos-text-and-doodles/", "timestamp": 1763687303.5855396}

People can use Perplexity as the default search engine, and they can also mention tabs to ask questions to the assistant. They can also use the voice mode to ask questions about all open tabs. Plus, the assistant can summarize searches across all tabs. Perplexity said the browser can research and shop on your behalf as well, and you can look at what action the Comet assistant is taking. What’s more, the Android version has an in-built ad blocker. The company said in the coming weeks it aims to add new features to the app, including a conversational agent that can search across sites, creating shortcuts for the assistant to take quick actions, and a fully functional password manager in coming weeks. Earlier this month, the startup updated its Comet Assistant on desktop to efficiently perform more complex tasks that run for longer, like shifting data from a website to a spreadsheet. While Perplexity has chosen to launch on Android, the company said it will also come to iOS soon. The company noted that Android has been a priority because of the volume of carriers and OEMs that have asked the startup to include Comet on their devices and solutions.

The company says the new feature lets users quickly share their photos, videos, and files without worrying about the kind of phone the other person uses. Quick Share currently works with AirDrop if the iPhone owner changes their settings to make their device discoverable to anyone using AirDrop’s “Everyone for 10 minutes” mode. The Pixel user will then be able to see the iPhone as an available device when selecting Quick Share. “This implementation using ‘Everyone for 10 minutes’ mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable ‘Contacts Only’ mode in the future,” Google explained in a blog post . The tech giant says you can ensure you’re sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen. Google notes that the update allows for two-way communication, which means that iPhone users can send files to Pixel phones as well. The Pixel device will also need to be set as discoverable in order to receive a file. The feature does not use a workaround, and the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, Google says. This means that data isn’t routed through a server and that shared content is never logged. “We built this with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that were tested by independent security experts,” Google wrote in the blog post. “It’s just one more way we’re bringing better compatibility that people are asking for between operating systems, following our work on RCS and unknown tracker alerts.” It’s worth noting that Google’s blog post doesn’t detail anything ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/androids-quick-share-now-works-with-iphones-airdrop-starting-with-the-pixel-10-lineup/", "timestamp": 1763687303.7241237}

And investors seem to agree. Point One Navigation, a startup that has developed precise location technology, has just raised $35 million in a Series C round led by Khosla Ventures. The company’s post-money valuation is now $230 million, according to one insider familiar with the deal. Point One, which was founded in 2016, has developed precise location technology that can be applied to any vehicle that moves, from autonomous consumer lawnmowers and drones to robots, consumer vehicles, agriculture equipment, and even humans donning a wearable device. For Point One, precise location means exactly that. The technology, called a positioning engine, can determine location within 1 centimeter in the best conditions, co-founder Aaron Nathan told TechCrunch. To achieve that, Point One has combined an augmented global navigation satellite system (GNSS), computer vision, and sensor fusion into an API. Typically that API is deployed as a software product because most new vehicles — like a slick EV or luxury car — come equipped with the necessary hardware. For vehicles like farm equipment or say a first responder that don’t, Point One adds a chipset into the mix. Point One started with a focus on automotive clients — a sign of the bullish autonomous vehicle technology times. That sector continues to make up a large slice of its revenue. Point One couldn’t disclose most of its commercial customer names, but it did share that its technology supports the advanced driver assistance and infotainment needs of an EV maker and is included in more than 150,000 of its vehicles.

Over three decades in Silicon Valley, she’s mastered the art of getting anyone on the phone with a simple text: “Can you call me?” or “Let’s talk tomorrow.” And they do. Now, as she prepares to leave Khosla Ventures (KV) after nearly five years as the firm’s first-ever CMO, Daver could be an indicator of where the tech world is headed. Her career has been a remarkably accurate barometer of the industry’s next big thing to date. She was at Inktomi during the search wars of the late ’90s (the dot.com highflier hit a $37 billion valuation before spiraling back to earth). She joined Netflix when people laughed at the idea of ordering DVDs online. She helped Walmart compete with Amazon on technology. She worked with Guardant Health to explain liquid biopsies before Theranos made blood testing infamous. She was even dressed down once by Steve Jobs over the marketing of a Motorola microprocessor (which could be its own short story). KV’s founder Vinod Khosla portrays his work with Daver thus: “Shernaz had a strong impact at KV as she helped me build our KV brand and was a valuable partner to our founders. I’m grateful for her time here and know we’ll stay close.” Asked about why she is leaving the firm, Daver was typically matter-of-fact. “I came to do a job, and the job was to build out the KV brand and to build out Vinod’s brand, and to help set up a marketing organization such that our companies and portfolios have somebody to go to. And I’ve done all of that.” It’s certainly true that when founders think of top AI investors, two to three venture firms spring to mind, and one of them is KV. It’s quite a turnaround for a firm that, for a period, was better known for Khosla’s legal battle over beach access than for his investments.

When it finally saw the year for itself, it was thunderstruck, telling him, “I am suffering from a massive case of temporal shock right now.” Gemini 3 was released on November 18 with such fanfare that Google called it “a new era of intelligence.” And Gemini 3 is, by nearly all accounts (including Karpathy’s), a very capable foundation model, particularly for reasoning tasks. Karpathy is a widely respected AI research scientist who was a founding member of OpenAI, ran AI at Tesla for a while, and is now building a startup, Eureka Labs, to reimagine schools for the AI era with agentic teachers. He publishes a lot of content on what goes on under-the-hood of LLMs . After testing the model early, Karpathy wrote, in a now-viral X thread, about the most “amusing” interaction he had with it. Apparently, the model’s pre-training data had only included information through 2024. So Gemini 3 believed the year was still 2024. When Karpathy attempted to prove to it that the date was truly November 17, 2025, Gemini 3 accused the researcher of “trying to trick it.” He showed it news articles, images, and Google search results.

Another possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior. This concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future. YouTube is also implementing standard safety features, including requiring users to send each other invites prior to initiating a chat, as well as the ability to unsend messages, block others, and report conversations.

Blue Origin is now referring to the two versions as New Glenn 9×4 and New Glenn 7×2. That added firepower will increase the New Glenn booster’s total thrust and allow it to carry “over 70 metric tons to low-Earth orbit,” slightly below Starship’s current theoretical capacity of 100 metric tons. SpaceX is working on new versions of Starship that could double that figure. The larger New Glenn will feature a much larger fairing (the forward-facing shield that covers the rocket’s payload) to allow bigger payloads at the top of the rocket.

Launching a video store feels like a natural evolution for Letterboxd, allowing users to rent movies instantly without having to navigate away from the platform. One of the key advantages of renting from Letterboxd, compared to other established platforms like Apple or Amazon, is its social discoverability features. If you notice a friend has logged a movie, you can check out their review and decide to rent it right then and there. The movie selection will also be based on what members actually want to watch, using data from the platform’s watchlists and activity. Rather than offering a random mix like some streaming services, the selection will feel more curated. Letterboxd has not yet announced the initial lineup of films or rental prices, but the company said users can expect rental availability and costs to vary by location.

For example, users could ask something like: “Hey, Google, I need your help. I’m suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?” If a spot looks interesting, Gemini can offer more information about the place, such as details about the restaurant’s most popular dish or whether the establishment is dog-friendly. Users can also reply to messages with Gemini and get summaries of texts. For instance, you can ask Gemini to let your friend know that you’re stuck in traffic and to add your ETA to the message. Or, you can ask Gemini to translate a message into a different language before sending it. Gemini also lets users access their emails in Gmail while driving.

For a few months last year, everyone became convinced that specific words like “delve” or “underscore” could give models away, but the evidence is thin, and as models have grown more sophisticated, the telltale words have become harder to trace. But as it turns out, the folks at Wikipedia have gotten pretty good at flagging AI-written prose — and the group’s public guide to “Signs of AI writing” is the best resource I’ve found for nailing down whether your suspicions are warranted. (Credit to the poet Jameson Fitzpatrick, who pointed out the document on X.) Since 2023, Wikipedia editors have been working to get a handle on AI submissions, a project they call Project AI Cleanup. With millions of edits coming in each day, there’s plenty of material to draw on, and in classic Wikipedia-editor style, the group has produced a field guide that’s both detailed and heavy on evidence. To start with, the guide confirms what we already know: automated tools are basically useless. Instead, the guide focuses on habits and turns of phrase that are rare on Wikipedia but common on the internet at large (and thus, common in the model’s training data). According to the guide, AI submissions will spend a lot of time emphasizing why a subject is important, usually in generic terms like “a pivotal moment” or “a broader movement.” AI models will also spend a lot of time detailing minor media spots to make the subject seem notable — the kind of thing you’d expect from a personal bio, but not from an independent source. The guide flags a particularly interesting quirk around tailing clauses with hazy claims of importance.

As a result of a settlement with the SEC, Curastory’s founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, has resigned from the role and replaced herself with Dave Dickman, former CEO of the influencer marketing platform Tagger. Under Dickman’s leadership, the company has begun fundraising, international expansion plans, and product updates, Kelly and Dickman tell TechCrunch. The settlement agreement specifically barred Kelly for 10 years from serving on the board of directors or as an executive at any company that would, essentially, fundraise. TechCrunch saw a version of this agreement that had not yet been finalized. It stated that Kelly agreed to these stipulations without admitting to or denying the allegations. Although Kelly remains a major shareholder and will remain an adviser, she told TechCrunch that “stepping aside was truly the only decision that I could make just to keep the company alive and thriving,” she said. Kelly founded the company in 2021. Curastory is a platform that helps content creators monetize their videos and has grown to about 400,000 creators using it, she said. It lets advertisers buy in-video ads from creators, while tracking metrics and supporting other features, like video editing. It has raised around $3 million to date from investors, including Lightspeed’s Scout Fund, Feld Ventures, and Mindspring Capital, according to PitchBook, which also listed it as having participated in a few accelerator programs like Techstars and the SPARK Program, held by AMEX Ventures and Project W, according to PitchBook. “It’s been a wild ride,” she admitted. As part of the settlement, Kelly also agreed to pay a fine.

From website banner ads to outdoor billboards, images generated by businesses using AI tools surround me. Hell, even the bar down the street posts happy hour flyers with that distinctly hazy, amber glow of some AI graphics. On Thursday, Google launched Nano Banana Pro, the company’s latest image generating model. Many of the updates in this release are targeted at corporate adoption, from putting Nano Banana Pro in Google Slides for business presentations to integrating the new model with Google Ads for advertisers globally. This “Pro” release is an iteration on its Nano Banana model that dropped earlier this year. Nano Banana became a viral sensation after users started posting personalized action figures and other meme-able creations on social media. Nano Banana Pro builds out the AI tool with a bevy of new abilities, like generating images in 4K resolution. It’s free to try out inside Google’s Gemini app, with paid Google One subscribers getting access to additional generations. One specific improvement is going to be catnip for corporations in this release: text rendering. From my initial tests generating outputs with text, Nano Banana Pro improves on the wonky lettering and strange misspellings common in many image models, including Google’s past releases. Google wants the images generated by this new model—text and all—to be more polished and production-ready for business use cases. “Even if you have one letter off it's very obvious,” says Nicole Brichtova, a product lead for image and video at Google DeepMind . “It's kind of like having hands with six fingers; it's the first thing you see.” She says part of the reason Nano Banana Pro is able to generate text more cleanly is the switch to a more powerful underlying model, Gemini 3 Pro .

The charges, which were unsealed in federal court on Wednesday, are part of a wider government effort to crack down on the smuggling of advanced AI chips to China. Over the past few years, the US has introduced a series of export control rules designed to prevent Chinese organizations from acquiring computer chips that have become popular for developing AI chatbots . The restrictions aim to slow China in what US officials have described as a race to develop powerful AI systems , including surveillance tools and autonomous weapons . Some Chinese companies have been forced to make do with older or less capable chips, but others have allegedly turned to smugglers. The new indictment alleges that Hon Ning Ho, Brian Curtis Raymond, Cham Li, and Jing Chen worked together to buy Nvidia chips through a sham real estate company in Florida and then resold them to Chinese companies. The hardware was allegedly shipped to China using doctored customs paperwork by way of Thailand and Malaysia, two countries that US regulators have identified as hot spots for chip smuggling. Prosecutors allege that the defendants exported about 400 Nvidia A100 GPUs and attempted to smuggle about 50 of Nvidia’s newer chips, known as the H200. The defendants are also accused of trying to export about 10 Hewlett Packard Enterprise supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 chips. Two undisclosed Chinese companies allegedly paid the defendants nearly $3.9 million in total for their efforts, according to the indictment, which was first reported by Court Watch . “This is an extremely serious offense.

Platform incompatibility has fostered real-life social friction, like the “ green bubble shaming ” phenomenon, where iPhone owners exclude Android owners from group chats. But Google has been working to minimize these disruptions. The company launched a crusade to convince Apple to adopt the RCS messaging standard to fix the common messaging hiccups between Android phones and iPhones. Google also worked with Apple to create a specification for unwanted tracking alerts—when your phone identifies an AirTag or another Bluetooth tracker on your person. Today, Google is fixing incompatibility issues with AirDrop. iPhone owners have been able to easily share files, contacts, photos, and anything else through Apple's wireless sharing system, provided both parties have an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Android phones have their own sharing protocol called Quick Share , but starting today and beginning with Google's Pixel 10 smartphones , Quick Share can work with AirDrop to send data to iPhones, iPads , and Macs of any variety . The caveat is that the iPhone user will need to switch AirDrop into the “Everyone for 10 Minutes” mode instead of \"Contacts Only\" mode. Google says this isn't some kind of workaround solution. It's a direct, peer-to-peer connection; your data isn't routed through a server, shared content isn't logged, and no extra data is shared. Naturally, iPhone owners will be able to send data back to Pixel 10 phones as well. Google has not worked with Apple on this cross-compatibility, as the company says it \"welcomes the opportunity\" to work with Apple so that this sharing function can work in the Contacts Only mode. “We accomplished this through our own implementation,” a Google spokesperson tells WIRED. “Our goal is to provide an easy and secure file-sharing experience for our users, regardless of who they are communicating with.” In a security blog post , Google says the underlying strategy for what makes this", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pixel-10-can-now-share-files-with-apples-airdrop/", "timestamp": 1763687310.459786}

It was called Swatch x You , and it let you tweak Swatch's standard New Gent 41-mm model by selecting one of the (surprisingly limited) preset designs, which you could then move, zoom, and rotate to fit over the watch and strap. You could also add in a chip for NFC payments, and, as a final flourish, put a very short personal message on the case back (to a maximum of 15 characters). As you can tell, although a fun idea, this offering was never designed to be anything near approaching bespoke. From tomorrow, however, the MoonSwatch maker is taking its Swatch x You model and giving it an artificial intelligence makeover. Dubbed AI‑DADA, Swatch says this AI-powered design tool lets you create entirely unique watches starting from a blank canvas and using only your imagination as a guide to the final outcome. After logging into your Swatch account, you prompt AI‑DADA with your own idea, then, in less than two minutes, a “unique watch design comes to life.” To underline this uniqueness, each AI‑DADA watch carries a “1/1” sign on its case back. This Swatch and Bathing Ape collaboration is part of the work now in at AI-DADA dataset. And, just as with Swatch x You, it's possible to further customize the watch by choosing indexes or selecting the color of its mechanism. To save on data center power drains and rampant creativity run amuck, you're only allowed three prompts per day on AI‑DADA, something that Swatch is spinning as a “creative challenge that makes every attempt feel special.” Ultimately, what we have here is a new version of Swatch x You that has been plugged with image-generation software supplied by OpenAI, thus letting the general public emblazon its timepieces with whatever graphics they see fit to dream up and d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/swatchs-new-openai-powered-tool-lets-you-design-your-own-watch/", "timestamp": 1763687311.0578296}

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website declares, “Due to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.” This will impact compliance and safety of new and future manufactured masks. Masks do have expiration dates, but I still think now is a good time to stock up on a variety of masks that you know are certified safe and effective. We've also included some tips on mask care and choosing the best kind of mask straps at the end of this list.

Google's Tensor G4 chipset powers it all, the same as in last year's flagship Pixel 9 series. And performance is pretty much identical—smooth and fast, whether gaming or multitasking.

They must be comfortable. They must be easy to wash. They must look relatively sharp, and not schlumpy, when you're in an environment where you could bump into anyone from a pro athlete to your work colleagues. Most of all, they must not drag on the floor of the airplane bathroom. It is such a quest that editor Adrienne So has, for years, referred to a spreadsheet known as the real-life Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, in which women from all over the country that she doesn't even know contribute their thoughts on pants that are reliable, comfortable, and usually black. Adrienne and I have tested dozens of pairs in airports, on road trips, and in random corners of the world. My favorite travel pants stretch while you run to your gate , breathe while you explore a new city , and are stylish enough to wear out to dinner.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They’ll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says.

Apple Best Buy Amazon Apple The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to get the bump to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance all around. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air.

I managed to break it right away, popping the screen cover off completely. I don't know if it was leftover glue or some sweet sugary substance I spilled on it, but the edges of the frame remained weirdly sticky with some gunk that liked to collect dirt. Gross as it was, and even without a screen cover, it still played games just fine for years. While not always the most durable of devices, the OG handheld Nintendo consoles could withstand enough of a beating to firmly enmesh themselves into the core memories of millions of dweebs of all ages. That is what the ModRetro Chromatic wants to be: the ultimate, hardiest version of the Game Boy ever. The Game Boy sigma , if you will. A sturdy box of nostalgia that you can take to your grave. ModRetro is a company run by Palmer Luckey, best known as the founder of the virtual reality company Oculus—now a Meta property. Nowadays, Luckey is a defense tech guy , busy cozying up to the Trump administration and running his company Anduril , the military contractor building AI-controlled weapons for the Pentagon, such as lethal drone swarms and killer chatbots . ModRetro Chromatic Rating: 8/10 ModRetro shares its name with an old online forum Luckey used to run, and it's more of a passion project. The goal is to recreate old-school gaming machines and package them in the slickest, most robust frames possible. With the Chromatic complete, the company plans to make a robust version of the Nintendo 64 next. Luckey has called these devices “a portal into the past that is going to live on forever.” Should you be concerned if your money is going to an arms dealer who also thinks cigarettes were good for society?

But the trick to getting rid of paper is to not worry about being perfect.", "content": "Wanting to get rid of paper in your life is easy. Following through with that promise to yourself is hard. I've been mostly paperless for close to 15 years, and the trick to it for me was to think about it the same way I think about taking care of my teeth. Staying organized is a kind of hygiene. It's almost never a one-and-done cleanup job. So think about dental hygiene . We learn to brush our teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and see a dentist every six months to catch problems before they get worse. However, if you don't follow that schedule precisely, you can still have good dental hygiene. You just have to do enough . If you do almost everything you're supposed to, but you miss two days of flossing or are a few months late scheduling your next cleaning, your teeth won't suddenly fall out. With hygiene (or any kind of maintenance), you don't have to be perfect; you just have to be good enough. Going paperless is very much like that. Here, I want to share with you the plan I used to remove most paper from my life. It should help you get started, but know in advance that you don't have to stick to it exactly every moment of every day. You can mess up. You can forget. So long as you get into the habit most of the time, you'll find yourself mostly paperless in a couple of months. Decide where to keep digitized papers. A natural choice is to save them in a cloud storage service , such as Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. By saving them in the cloud, you always have a backup. If you save files locally to your device, you could lose them all if your device is destroyed, lost, or stolen. Create an inbox. An inbox is nothing more than a folder where you will save newly scanned papers by default. If you are highly organized, you might have specific folders where you want to sort each paper you scan. That's great. But where will the files go when you're feeling lazy or strapped for time?

For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves. But I’d moved just fine from plane to hotel to bookstore. I’d even made a point of walking to the bookstores from hotels and back, to indulge some kind of Walt Whitman–esque fantasy. But now, at the last moment, alarm bells were going off. The pain felt as if I’d taken a hard hit to my tailbone, as I’d once done after going off a jump in an inner tube and landing ass-first on hard-packed snow. But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute. I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination. By the time I had to stand up, it was all I could do to not cry out—as bad as the pain was sitting down, standing up sent a radical guitar solo through my coccyx. At that time, I was about four months postpartum from delivering my first baby, and had had a blissful recovery, all things considered. I had pelvic muscles of steel, thanks to over a decade of lifting heavy weights, a practice I continued until two weeks before giving birth. I had only been back to lifting for a couple of months—deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead press, here and there some rows or lat pull-downs—but everything had been going well.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent. Similarly, since implementation of the Online Safety Act , Pornhub has lost nearly 80 percent of its UK viewership. The company argues that it’s a privacy risk to leave age verification up to third-party sites and that people will simply seek adult content on platforms that don’t comply with the laws. “We have seen an exponential surge in sea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pornhub-is-urging-tech-giants-to-enact-device-based-age-verification/", "timestamp": 1763687312.981503}

As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments.

A draft of the order viewed by WIRED directs US attorney general Pam Bondi to create an “AI Litigation Task Force,” whose purpose is to sue states in court for passing AI regulations that allegedly violate federal laws governing things like free speech and interstate commerce. Trump could sign the order, which is currently titled “Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,” as early as this week, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation.

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said. The CEO’s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments. But the increase was not enough to fully make up for the recent sell-off. Nvidia has enjoyed three years of booming success since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and caused a massive surge in demand for the company’s GPUs, which are used to train and operate generative AI systems. Nvidia dominates the global market for GPUs, and its latest releases have become highly sought after, with demand far exceeding supply. On Wednesday, Nvidia executives reiterated that it has about $500 billion in unfilled orders.

Aaron Saunders, who is partly responsible for giving the world back-flipping and dancing machines, joined as the VP of hardware engineering earlier this month. The hire is a key part of DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis’ vision for Gemini to become a sort of robot operating system, similar to how Google supplies its Android software to an array of smartphone manufacturers. “You can sort of think of it as a bit like an Android play [...] We want to build an AI system, a Gemini base, that can work almost out-of-the-box, across any body configuration,” Hassabis said in an interview with WIRED. “Obviously humanoids, but nonhumanoids too.” Boston Dynamics is famous for developing legged robots, including four-legged dog-sized systems and humanoid machines capable of impressive acrobatic feats. Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years.

When it debuted at CES early this year, the Brisk It Zelos-450 was advertised as being \"the first grill with generative AI.\" That AI comes in the form of \"Vera,\" an in-app feature that “creates customized recipes based on your input\" and then sets the grill's temperature to cook them. The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice.

Interactions with AI tools are often mundane, but they can also lead to dire outcomes. Users sometimes experience mental breakdowns during lengthy conversations with chatbots or confide in them about their suicidal ideations . “We need to have really big conversations across society about what role we want AI to play in our future as humans who are interacting with each other,” says Ryn Linthicum, head of user well-being policy at Anthropic . At the event‚ organized by Anthropic and Stanford, industry folk intermingled with academics and other experts, splitting into small groups to talk about nascent AI research and brainstorming deployment guidelines for chatbot companions. Anthropic says less than one percent of its Claude chatbot’s interactions are roleplay scenarios initiated by users; it’s not what the tool was designed for. Still, chatbots and the users who love interacting with them as companions are a complicated issue for AI builders, which often take disparate approaches to safety . And if I’ve learned anything from the Tamagotchi era , it’s that humans will easily form bonds with technology. Even if some AI bubble does imminently burst and the hype machine moves on, plenty of people will continue to seek out the kinds of friendly, sycophantic AI conversations they’ve grown accustomed to over the past few years. “One of the really motivating goals of this workshop was to bring folks together from different industries and from different fields,” says Linthicum. Some early takeaways from the meeting were the need for better targeted interventions inside bots when harmful patterns are detected and more robust age verification methods to protect children. “We really were thinking through in our conversations not just about can we categorize this as", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-biggest-ai-companies-met-to-find-a-better-path-for-chatbot-companions/", "timestamp": 1763687315.4609873}

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763687315.5845165}

The startup plans to put its fully autonomous robots in homes next year.", "content": "Memo may not be the world’s fastest barista, but it is impressive—for a robot. I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again. Unlike humans, industrial robots cannot typically adapt or improvise to changes or unfamiliar situations.

It just means you’ll lose the excuse of “Sorry, my keyboard didn’t pick up that keypress” when you peek just a bit too far into a sniper lane and get domed. More than anything else, the main appeal of Hall effect keyboards is just how much they can do, from adjustable actuation points, rapid trigger, accidental keypress protection, and multiple inputs per key.

When a magnet moves closer to an electrical current in a conductor, it moves the electrons, and with this, the distance between the magnet and the conductor can be measured and reported back to your computer. The magnet sits in the switch's stem, and the Hall effect sensor is on the printed circuit board of the keyboard.

The conspiracy theories benefited him; they were one of the factors buoying him to office. It’s only been in the last few weeks—spurred by the release of new Epstein documents and the public defection of GOP lawamkers—that the complex web of misinformation has spun out of Trump’s control . It all began with QAnon. It is hard to overstate just how fringe QAnon was when Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene began posting about it in November 2017, when she posted a video praising Q as a “patriot.” The movement was led by “Q,” someone who claimed to be a government insider and who posted what they claimed was top secret intel in posts, known as “drops,” on the anonymous message board 4chan. Q laid out a wild and untrue conspiracy theory that a cabal of Democrat and Hollywood elites were behind a supposed global sex trafficking ring. Already, Jeffrey Epstein was among the key characters in the QAnon universe. Epstein was first mentioned just two weeks after QAnon began in late October 2017 and was referenced dozens of times in the almost 5,000 posts Q wrote over the following three years. Like all good conspiracy theories, this one contained a kernel of truth: The fact that Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution solicitation charges meant QAnon supporters felt emboldened to believe every wild allegation that Q put forward . I became aware of QAnon in early 2018 but didn’t write about it until September of that year . At the time Greene started promoting it, years before she was elected to Congress, the conspiracy was in its infancy with just a handful of dedicated followers. Trump was quickly cast as the hero of this narrative, working against the “deep state” to expose these demons and bring about “the storm,” which would see the cabal unmasked and everyone from Epstein to the Cl", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-donald-trump-lost-control-of-the-epstein-spin-cycle/", "timestamp": 1763687316.0856178}

This initiative is called “FIFA Pass.” “FIFA Pass is a prioritized appointment scheduling system,” Infantino said from the Oval Office. “So if you have a ticket for the World Cup, you can have a prioritized appointment to get your visa. Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States.

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108.

In the first nine months of 2025, Porsche's operating profit plummeted by 99 percent compared to the same stint the year before. Yep, 99 percent. Profit has tanked for the auto brand with a track record of making billions. The reasons for Porsche's misfortune are no secret. There's the hugely expensive product strategy shift that saw the dramatic scaling back of EV plans. There was Porsche scrapping projects to build its own EV batteries in-house and instead developing new combustion and hybrid models. Plus, the double hit of US tariffs and a slump in the Chinese market have left the German automaker reeling. However, whether or not the EU decides to rewrite its EV transition timetable , the future for autos, sooner or later, will not be combustion but electric. So this means that European car companies playing the long game must still show their prowess in electrification. Which brings us to today's reveal of the final production Cayenne Electric and Cayenne Turbo Electric. The Cayenne is Porsche's first fully electric SUV. Costing $109,000 for the Cayenne, and $163,000 for the turbo version (£83,200 and £130,900 respectively in the UK), Porsche will be hoping that this, its first ever fully electric SUV, will present better long-term value for money than its formidable Taycan has, which saw unlucky owners lose half the value of the car in its first six months, pushing some into negative equity on the vehicles. This new electric SUV is the most powerful production Porsche of all time, and the specs are fittingly mighty. The Cayenne Turbo shifts from 0 to 62 mph in 2.5 seconds, from 0 to 124 mph in 7.4 seconds, and goes on to a top speed of 162 mph. A new drive system develops up to 850 kW (1,156 PS) and up to 1,500 Nm of torque when the cars' Launch Control is activated.

We have a guide on how to find the perfect soundbar , with definitions of all the major terms you'll come across while shopping and detailed information about connecting your new soundbar. Be sure to read our Best Bookshelf Speakers , Best OLED TVs , and Best Audiophile Gear guides for more ways to upgrade your home theater. Updated November 2025: We’ve added the Samsung Q990D, the JBL Bar 500 MK2, and the Marshall Heston 120, and updated prices and copy with the latest info. Yamaha Amazon Walmart Yamaha Target Yamaha makes some of the best speakers and soundbars that you can buy, and we really like the compact nature of this bar and wireless subwoofer combo. This works great for those of us who want cinematic low end, but can't rely on an outlet right where you want to place it. It can even be placed horizontally to fit under higher-bottomed couches and chairs, or a cabinet with legs. Simple HDMI connection makes it super easy to pair with any modern TV, and it even has Bluetooth for pairing with phones, tablets, and other media players. There's easy wall mounting holes for TVs in fancier rooms, but we like that the compact, 2-foot main bar fits well on even smaller TV consoles.

This truly amazing pro-tier controller can be finessed to do just about anything. But it will cost you.", "content": "8 /10 Thrustmaster has been building a reliable fleet of high-end joypads for years now, largely through its range of ESWAP controllers featuring modular components and re-mappable inputs. It's also put out one of the better stick-drift eliminating Hall effect grips for PC and Xbox players in recent memory with 2024's H.E.A.R.T. controller . So what happens when they get thrown into a blender? Out pours the ESWAP X2 H.E., combining all the customization of the ESWAP range but finally delivering the pro-tier precision of Hall effect . It outperforms both its parents—but has also inherited some of the family's worst traits. When I reviewed the H.E.A.R.T. Controller, I termed it \"an entry-level pro controller\". By extension, the ESWAP X2 H.E. is what you might graduate to. Compared to that predecessor, it feels like a massive upgrade—from the overall build quality to the almost daunting versatility of its swappable components, everything about it feels like it's giving you more . However, for those coming from previous generation ESWAP pads , it's unlikely to seem quite so revolutionary—in fact, it's essentially the same, bar the addition of Hall effect tech. Out of the box, the X2 H.E. looks suitably impressive, a monolith of black broken up only by the copper tones of the D-pad and triggers, subtly matched by the lettering on the face buttons and dragon \"2\" of the logo. The LED color bar of the H.E.A.R.T. is gone, making this look and feel far more mature, although the mix of matte black for fixed features and glossy removable modules does make for a degree of visual inconsistency. In the hand, it's definitely better suited to those with larger grips, thanks to a chunky overall size of 160 x 120 x 60 mm and the unusual height of the default thumbstick modules. These sit about 12 mm from their base, compared to the approximately 8 mm of a standard Xbox controller, and you can immediately feel the difference. Thrustmaster ESWAP X2 H.E.

E-readers (short for ebook readers) are just so convenient—and they might just make you read more too . Rather than lumping two or three books in a bag, an e-reader lets you carry thousands of books or dozens of audiobooks in a single, slim, rectangular tablet. Their paperlike screens are easy on the eyes, and unlike an app on your phone, they won’t inundate you with distracting notifications. Books can also be expensive and take up a lot of physical space, but that’s not a problem with ebooks. Even better, you can check out digital books from a library without leaving your house. Naturally, when you hear “e-reader,” you might think Kindle, there are some great non-Amazon e-readers out there too. Our favorite all-around e-reader is the Kobo Libra Colour ($250) , which has a color screen, page turner buttons, and can even double as a digital notebook. If you're looking for the best Kindle, our favorite is the 12th-generation Kindle Paperwhite ($160) (and we've got an entire Best Kindles guide that breaks down the full Kindle lineup). We're also fans of the Boox Palma 2 ($300) if you want an e-reader that's smartphone sized. Looking for more reader recommendations?

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate.

Revenue growth still lopsided with HLS contributing ~94% of incremental revenue sequentially. Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy. Deal wins TCV was USD447.7mn (1.4x book-to-bill), showing moderation with Q4 and TTM TCV up 6% and 12.6% YoY, respectively. Amid the challenging macros, the management aims for top-quartile growth in FY25E, while maintaining EBITM at FY24 levels. Company reiterated their medium-term target of improving EBITM by 200-300bps over the next 3 years. Outlook However, progress has been slow and target is shifted by a year; which is disappointing. Moderation in deal intake, Q4 performance, and slow progress on margin trajectory led to EPS cut of 5-6% for FY25-26E. Valuation remains rich even after today’s ~10% price correction. We retain REDUCE with a TP of Rs3,700/sh at 34x Mar-25E EPS.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

Donbas comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that Ukraine currently hold. 3.

This development comes as the US appears less in sync with much of the developed world, which is increasingly acknowledging the reality of human-induced climate change . According to the plan proposed by the US Department of the Interior, 34 lease sales will be offered, which will permit drilling in 1.27 billion acres, an area the size of the Amazon.  The plan includes waters off the north coast of Alaska that have never been drilled before, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico, which the administration refers to as the Gulf of America, and off the coast of California. \"The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America's offshore production,\" AFP quoted Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, while hinting at former President Joe Biden. Burgum emphasised that offshore energy development demands significant time and investment. \"By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America's offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed, and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come,\" Burghum said. Trump frequently talks about the need for America to drill more for fossil fuels and criticises the global shift to renewables, which he calls a \"scam.\" He consistently dismisses climate change science as “a con.” During his presidency, the country has withdrawn from international agreements on tackling climate change and has not sent an official delegation to the ongoing COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

The shift from soldiers to machines is already underway: Autonomous helicopters, swarming drones and recon aircraft are here now. Fighter-less jets and autonomous bombers are on the way.” Melania Trump concluded her remarks with heartfelt thanks to the military community. “To every service member — thank you for standing watch so others can celebrate in peace. And to every military spouse and child — thank you for your strength and love. You serve our country, too.” \"As we give thanks this season, let us remember what unites us — our shared love of country, our faith in one another and our pride in those who serve,” she added, highlighting the ongoing commitment to both technology and tradition in America’s defense.

Trump, in his speech, made a point of recognizing Ronaldo, whom he said he introduced to his teenage son.

Trump has long criticised Powell —whom he nominated during his first term—for keeping rates “too high,” a stance he says is slowing economic momentum. At the event, Trump publicly urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to expedite the search for Powell’s successor. “You’ve got to work on him, Scott. The only thing Scott’s blowing it on is the Fed,” Trump told Bessent, who was in the audience. In another pointed remark—delivered with a hint of humour—Trump added: “The rates are too high, Scott, and if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass.” Powell’s term as Fed chair ends in May, while his term as governor runs until 2028. Bessent, who is leading the selection process, told Fox News on Tuesday that Trump is set to meet the three finalists after Thanksgiving, with a new Fed chair likely to be announced before Christmas. Trump said his administration has “great names” under consideration, though he again acknowledged Bessent has declined to be considered for the role. Trump reiterated at the forum that Bessent “does not want the job” despite the president’s repeated praise for him.

Derby Nov 20 (Reuters) - Concerns about financial market stability, including the potential for a sharp drop in asset prices, are emerging as a fresh theme for Federal Reserve officials as they debate when and even whether to cut interest rates further. In a talk at Georgetown University on Thursday, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook did not offer a view on near-term interest-rate policy specifically. But she called out a range of risks to the financial system, including fast-growing private credit markets, hedge fund trading in the Treasury securities market, and the adoption of generative artificial intelligence into machine-based trading. Cook also suggested she would not be surprised by a collapse in historically elevated asset prices - which have helped shore up overall consumer spending and the U.S. economy more broadly - though such a decline would not by itself signal financial market instability. \"Currently, my impression is that there is an increased likelihood of outsized asset price declines.\" Speaking at a separate event earlier, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack reiterated her opposition to further interest-rate cuts because inflation remains too high, and signaled she sees easy financial conditions as another argument against rate cutting.

Officials said the blaze, which erupted in a section hosting sideline events, was quickly brought under control and no injuries were reported. Fire authorities, however, ordered a full site evacuation for safety checks, delaying conference proceedings. Hours before the disruption, UN Secretary- General António Guterres pressed delegates to reach a deal despite slow progress. “We are down to the wire and the world is watching Belém,” he warned, urging negotiators to “show willingness and flexibility to deliver results.” He reminded countries that frontline communities facing “flooded homes, failed harvests [and] lost livelihoods” expect concrete action, not excuses. Talks have struggled to advance on contentious issues, including how aggressively countries should phase out fossil fuels and how much financial support wealthy nations should provide to vulnerable countries. Guterres said he was “perfectly convinced” compromise was still possible and rejected the idea that failing to adopt the strongest measures would constitute failure. He renewed calls for richer nations to triple annual adaptation finance from $40 billion to $120 billion, urging them to back vulnerable nations facing intensifying floods, droughts and extreme heat.

US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and US Representative Robert Garcia of California introduced the bill, named “Stop Ballroom Bribery Act”, on Tuesday. The bill seeks to “root out apparent bribery and corruption involving President Trump’s ballroom .” Earlier this month, the White House released a list of 37 donors funding his White House ballroom, including crypto billionaires, charitable organisations, sports team owners and more. As per a news release, wealthy individuals and organisations have come forward to fund the lavish $300 million ballroom, “many of whom currently need something from the Trump administration — raising serious concerns of quid-pro-quo arrangements and possible bribery”. In a statement after introducing the ‘Stop Ballroom Bribery Act’ Bill, Senator Elizabeth Warren accused billionaires and giant companies of lining up to donate to Trump's $300 million White House ballroom. “Billionaires and giant corporations with business in front of this administration are lining up to dump millions into Trump’s new ballroom — and Trump is showing them where to sign on the dotted line,\" she said.

She thanked Trump by name: “I wanted to thank President Trump for prioritising this issue … for calling for urgent action to defend Christians in Nigeria, to combat extremism and to bring a stop to violence … simply because of how they pray.” Speaking as someone deeply grateful for the religious freedom she enjoyed in the U.S., Minaj said, “I stood there as a proud New Yorker … we live in a country where we could freely and safely worship God, regardless of one’s creed, background, or politics … No group should ever be persecuted for practising their religion.” She described her activism not as partisan, but as deeply personal, rooted in faith: “Protecting Christians in Nigeria is not about taking sides or dividing people. It is about uniting humanity.” Her remarks coincided with her public social media responses to Trump, which had already stirred speculation about her political leanings. In recent weeks, she echoed Trump’s narrative on the Nigerian crisis, posting on X (formerly Twitter): “No group should ever be persecuted for practising their religion … Thank you to The President & his team for taking this seriously.” Conservative commentators swiftly interpreted her remarks as a declaration of a MAGA -style alignment, with some calling her “the first major figure in Hollywood to publicly side with Trump in this capacity.” She also addressed her fanbase — known as ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/nicki-minaj-is-now-maga-rapper-publicly-sides-with-donald-trump-backs-his-stance-on-protecting-christians-in-nigeria-11763656737954.html", "timestamp": 1763687365.9736805}

The decision, notified to the Union and state governments on 11 November, brings uniformity to the Object Heads of expenditure—the most detailed level of the accounting hierarchy that classifies how each rupee of government expenditure is categorised. For years, states recorded this expenditure head in different ways, making comparisons difficult, delaying data analysis, and reducing the accuracy of budgetary assessments. Sinha said that the new standardised framework will allow uniform, transparent and comparable financial reporting for the first time. “The harmonisation “addresses a decades-long issue” and strengthens the foundations of public financial management. The list was finalised by a joint working group comprising officers from the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), state governments, the Controller General of Accounts and the Controller General of Defence Accounts. While states may retain unique expenditure practices under sub-heads, the core structure will now be common nationwide. CAG has implemented another major reform by advancing the timelines for preparing Monthly Civil Accounts. These accounts, which were earlier finalised around the 25th of each month, will now have to be prepared by the 10th. Faster account compilation will provide state administrations, RBI, and other stakeholders with earlier visibility into fiscal trends, aiding budget planning and improving fiscal discipline.

FIFA has advised World Cup host cities to expect a 50/50 split between domestic and international visitors, as per a report by Forbes quoting tourism officials from Philadelphia and Kansas City where the games will be held.

Despite the decline, prices remain significantly higher than before the pandemic, reflecting continued pressures on US farmers and the broader food supply chain. Each year, volunteer shoppers across all 50 states and Puerto Rico track grocery prices for staple holiday foods. Since 1986, the basket has included key items such as turkey, stuffing, cranberries, pumpkin pie mix, sweet potatoes, dinner rolls, milk and vegetables. The survey highlights what Americans can expect to pay at grocery stores during Thanksgiving week. This year’s Thanksgiving basket shows a mix of savings and price spikes: Items that became cheaper, and items that became more expensive: When items like ham, Russet potatoes and green beans—added to the survey in 2018—are included, the total cost rises to $77.09, or $7.71 per person. This expanded basket is only slightly cheaper than last year, down just 28 cents. A 16-pound turkey now accounts for just 39% of the classic meal cost—the bird’s lowest share since 2000. Turkey prices are down 16% from last year due to lower demand for turkey outside Thanksgiving and declining prices for frozen birds, which remain the holiday standard. Americans now consume 13 pounds of turkey per year, nearly 3 pounds less than six years ago. The biggest price jumps came from produce-heavy sides. These increases stem from factors such as: Hurricane damage in major producing states like North Carolina Higher fertilizer, fuel, labor and machinery costs Weather disruptions and transport delays Because produce starts from a lower price point, even small cost increases create large year-to-year percentage changes.

Epstein, who had ties with powerful figures, died of suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019. The Justice Department will release its Epstein-related material within 30 days, as required by legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Senate, confirmed Attorney General Pam Bondi. However, even though Trump has signed the bill, it doesn't guarantee the release of all files, as several documents may remain confidential. The Justice Department has often cited the need to protect investigations when withholding information from the public. According to Reuters, the release of files may not be comprehensive, because the legislation passed by Congress includes provision allowing the Justice Department to hold back personal information about Epstein's victims. The New York Times reported that under the legislation, the Trump administration may withhold records that identify victims or include images of child sexual abuse, or are otherwise classified. The legislation also allows records to be withheld if they would jeopardize an active federal investigation. Insiders warn that even with the president's signature, his administration could lean on procedural delays or lingering federal investigations to keep explosive details out of the public eye, reported AFP.

It also uses dried yellow mealworms to create an unusual drink that many people find shocking. Unusual coffee trends are common in China . Some cafes add deep-fried worms to drinks while some mix fried chilli and hot pepper powder into lattes. According to Chinese doctors, yellow mealworms are rich in protein and may help improve the immune system. A museum worker says the ant-based drink tastes sour. The pitcher plant version, on the other hand, tastes like normal coffee. The roach coffee is mainly tried by curious youngsters because their parents dislike anything related to cockroaches. The shop sells over 10 cups of this unusual brew each day. “The roach coffee is mainly consumed by curious young people. Parents with children do not like it as they dislike cockroaches,” he said. Visitors say the flavour feels burnt and slightly sour, which fits the museum’s insect theme. The drink costs 45 yuan (more than ₹ 550). It is sold only inside the museum’s own cafes. “We launched this type of coffee at the end of June, and it trended on the internet recently. As an insect-themed museum, it seemed like a good idea to have drinks that match,” an employee told the Chinese media. Staff members said the idea originated in June and gained popularity online later. That encouraged more people to try it. The museum has also created drinks using pitcher plant digestive juice. It has also innovated a special ant-based brew that was offered only during Halloween, according to the South China Morning Post.

At least 44% of Indians believe that environmental quality was better in 1975 than it is today. Recent natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, appear to have reinforced the notion that the environment has deteriorated over time. A similar trend is seen in perceptions of happiness, with 41% of Indians believing that people were happier in 1975. “Respondents pointed to greater social bonding, fewer digital distractions, more family time, and a slower pace of life.

Gavai said its earlier judgment, which had introduced fixed timelines and suggested that bills could be treated as automatically approved if constitutional authorities delayed action, was incorrect. Such directions, the bench said, take away powers that the Constitution gives only to the President and governors. Other judges on the Bench were Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P.S. Narasimha and Atul S. Chandurkar. The ruling is likely to influence how impasses between state governments and governors over bill approvals are resolved and opens up the possibility of delays over bills in states relating to economic, business, financial, and infrastructure domains, among others. Like, for instance, Tamil Nadu’s Online Gambling Prohibition Bill. Passed in October 2022, the bill remained in limbo for months, leaving the gaming industry in uncertainty until assent was finally granted in April 2023. Legislative delays? The ruling comes as several states are struggling with delayed assent to important laws, slowing commercial and economic reforms and creating uncertainty for industries and investors. Under Articles 200 and 201, governors and the President hold the discretion to approve or withhold assent, but long periods of inaction have stalled policies relating to online gaming, industrial land rules, power tariffs and urban development. In Punjab, multiple bills passed in 2023, including those dealing with municipal administration and electricity reforms, were held up for months, delaying tariff decisions and slowing infrastructure planning until the Supreme Court intervened.

Entrepreneurs would also be included in the fast-track scheme, as per the report. For those earning between £50,000 and £125,000, they would have to wait for five years, in line with current regulations. Individuals earning less than £50,000 would face a doubling of the residency requirement, from five to ten years, the news outlet notes.

Kennedy Jr's Centers for Disease Control (CDC), on Thursday said that claims about vaccines not causing autism are not ‘evidence-based’.

RFK Jr. and US President Donald Trump have promoted the theory that childhood vaccines are a cause of autism. The agency said that ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ has not been removed due to an agreement with the chair of the US Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that it would remain on the CDC website. On its website, CDC stated that studies supporting a link have been ignored by health authorities. “US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)has launched a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism, including investigations on plausible biologic mechanisms and potential causal links.” “Scientific studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines contribute to the development of autism.

The new rules will make valuations clearer and more consistent, covering all necessary aspects and addressing potential conflicts of interest and risks.", "content": "New Delhi: The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has proposed a new format for professionals valuing distressed assets to make reports uniform, credible, and reduce debt resolution lawsuits. The new format prescribed on Wednesday increases the need for disclosures on valuation risks, any conflict of interest involved and how professional judgement is used in determining the value of assets. The idea is to enhance the confidence of stakeholders in the due diligence process and to make negotiations more realistic for better outcomes. The move to standardise the valuation report comes in the context of these reports becoming the subject of litigation in some of the bankruptcy cases. A standardised format is expected to make assessments easier for creditors as well as potential investors. This is crucial because based on the assessment of the distressed enterprise’s value, creditors decide to rescue or to liquidate the company. The format mandates the necessary information and documentation, requires conflict of interest disclosure, and covers factors relevant to recoverability, such as costs and economic trends. IBBI will accept public suggestions on the format till 10 December. Yogendra Aldak, executive partner at Lakshmikumaran and Sridharan attorneys, said the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) valuation guidelines will bring consistency, transparency, and standardization, leading to reports that are well-reasoned and backed by sufficient evidence. These guidelines seeking standardization of valuation reports are likely to promote more informed and effective decision making for the resolution professionals, said Aldak. Experts also highlighted the challenges in valuation that professionals encounter on the ground. “IBBI’s proposal to standardize valuation reports under the IBC is a very welcome step that should improve transparency, credibility and consistency, and help reduce the kind of disputes seen in cases like Ramkrishna Forgings Ltd.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.
