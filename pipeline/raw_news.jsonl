The committee’s report was on the ‘Review of Autonomous Bodies and Institutions – NTA, NAAC , Draft UGC Regulations, ICHR, ICPR, ICSSR, IIAS ( Shimla ) and Auroville Foundation under the Department of Higher Education’ The committee, headed by Rajya Sabha MP and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, noted that NTA did not declare the results of the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) in time in the last few years. “Such a delay is a cause of major concern as it not only delays the admission process but also delays the start of the academic session by the on-boarded universities, which ultimately puts unnecessary pressure on the students. The Committee emphasises that NTA should not only conduct the examinations within time but also declare the results in a time-bound manner,” it stated in its report. Referring to 14 competitive examinations conducted by NTA in 2024, the committee observed that at least five faced major issues – UGC-NET , CSIR-NET , and NEET-PG were postponed, NEET-UG saw paper leaks, and CUET results were postponed. In the JEE Main exam held in January 2025, at least 12 questions had to be withdrawn due to errors in the final answer key, the committee’s report noted. “The Committee observed that such instances do not inspire confidence of the examinees in the system. The Committee therefore recommends that NTA need to quickly get their act together so that such instances, which otherwise are fully avoidable, do not occur in future.” Of the Rs. 3,512.98 crore that the NTA collected, it has spent Rs. 3,064.77 crore, with a surplus of Rs. 448 crore in the past six years, the report stated, recommending that this corpus be", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/parliament-committee-asks-nta-strengthen-testing-capabilities-conduct-jee-neet-cuet-ug-pg-ugc-net-csir-exam-results-timely-10409064/", "timestamp": 1765193126.5311854}

Around 32,000 students were enrolled in these courses across the state when the Supreme Court, on November 5 last year, deemed the Uttar Pradesh madarsa education board’s practice of awarding Kamil (graduate-level) and Fazil (postgraduate-level) degrees “unconstitutional”, ruling that such authority lies only with universities regulated under the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act. For Saqlain Raza, a Fazil first-year student at Madarsa Jamia Farooquia in Varanasi, the ruling has forced a major shift. Raza, who has already cleared his first-year Fazil exam, is now preparing to join Kashi Vidyapeeth for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. “I have to think about my career. Given the situation, I will pursue BA, and later, MA,” he told PTI. He said although his Aalim (higher secondary) qualification makes him eligible for BA admission, the years he spent pursuing Kamil and Fazil would effectively go to waste. Raza is not alone. Many students pursuing higher religious studies in madrassas are uncertain about their academic careers. Ghulam Masih, a Kamil first-year student from Madarsa Darul Uloom Faiz-ur-Rasool in Siddharthnagar, said he too is planning to enrol into BA and MA courses from a university.

However, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha refuted the claim that the Lok Bhavan had caused a delay. Sinha wrote on social media that he had returned the file the same day, December 2, with a query about the possibility of holding the examination on the scheduled date if the upper age limit was relaxed, but received no follow-up from the government.

Applications for the Global Workforce Seasonal Visa (GWSV) and the Peak Seasonal Visa (PSV) will open on December 8, 2025. The initiative is designed to help accredited employers fill seasonal roles more efficiently while ensuring safeguards remain in place to prevent misuse of the system. The new visas will specifically target industries that depend heavily on seasonal labour, including horticulture, agriculture, tourism, and hospitality. The GWSV and PSV are expected to simplify the hiring process for roles that, while temporary in nature, are vital to New Zealand’s economic cycles. By streamlining recruitment procedures, the government aims to provide employers with quicker access to qualified seasonal workers, thereby supporting industries during peak demand periods. The step is taken to balance New Zealand’s economic needs with regulatory oversight, ensuring that seasonal employment opportunities are filled fairly and transparently. Global Workforce Seasonal Visa (GWSV) The Global Workforce Seasonal Visa (GWSV) has been introduced to support industries that require long-term seasonal labour. It comes with several distinctive features and requirements: — Streamlined hiring process: Employers are not required to advertise locally or conduct a labour market test before hiring under this visa. — Experience criteria : Applicants must demonstrate at least three seasons of relevant work experience within the last six years. — Residency condition : Holders of the visa must spend a minimum of three months outside New Zealand each year. — Validity period : The visa will be issued for three years, offering stability for both employers and workers. — Safeguards : Applicants must meet health and character requirements, ensuring compliance with immigration standa", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/new-zealand-immigration-announces-new-seasonal-visa-categories-under-aewv-framework-10407012/", "timestamp": 1765193128.6704159}

My mother, now retired, always pushed me to study seriously, while my father, an international truck driver who travelled across Africa, showed me what dedication and resilience look like. Watching him cross borders for work made me believe early on that the world is bigger than where you are born—and that education could be my passport to explore it. That mindset is what led me to India. Right after my secondary school, I received admission to Marwadi University in Rajkot, Gujarat, through the Study in India scheme. The programme was meant to strengthen international relations and bring students like me to Indian campuses. The scholarship covered my tuition fees, food, and accommodation, though not my stipend, visa, or travel. I had to take the very first Ind-SAT exam in 2020—conducted across more than 50 countries—to qualify. When the results arrived, I felt genuinely privileged. That scholarship changed the direction of my life. At Marwadi University, I completed my BTech, and by the time I graduated, I knew I wanted to pursue a more specialised path – something that would allow me to contribute to Zambia’s infrastructure development in the future. Construction Technology and Management was the perfect match, and one name kept coming up whenever I discussed my dreams with mentors: IIT Bombay . So I applied through the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarship scheme. For international students, ICCR manages the entire admission process. There is no Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) or Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) requirement; selection is merit-based, depending on academic record and overall competence. My preparation therefore was straightforward but demanding: keep my grades strong and present my achievements clearly. The toughest part wasn’t the academics—it was waiting.

The section on the Ghaznavid invasions is preceded by a box that contains “a word of caution”. The box is similar to the “note on history’s darker periods”, which was published in the class 8 textbook, placed before the chapter on the Delhi Sultanate. The box in the class 7 textbook refers to this note and states that it explains how history has recorded war, conquest and destruction more than peace, good governance or creativity, and how the world over historians have sometimes hesitated to draw attention to such darker periods. “Our approach is that it is better to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. In addition, we should not forget that while past events cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone responsible for them today,” it reads. The new textbook is meant for use in the ongoing academic session. Part 1 of the textbook was released earlier this year. The old NCERT class 7 history textbook had a paragraph on the Mahmud of Ghazni. It pointed out that rulers tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples, and chose to target temples which were sometimes extremely rich when they attacked kingdoms. It referred to the Mahmud of Ghazni as having raided the subcontinent 17 times with a religious motive, targeting wealthy temples and taking away their wealth. ‘The Ghaznavid Invasions’ section has about six pages including boxes and pictures.

The institute has also reiterated conditions related to age, number of attempts and Class XII qualification. This year, the examination will be held on May 17, Sunday. Under Criterion A1, candidates must be among the top 2,50,000 performers in JEE Main 2026 (BE/BTech paper). The shortlisting for JEE Advanced follows a rigid category-wise percentage: 10% GEN-EWS, 27% OBC-NCL, 15% SC, 7.5% ST and 40.5% OPEN, with 5% horizontal reservation for PwD candidates within each of these categories. IIT Roorkee has clarified that the total may marginally exceed 2.5 lakh if “tied” ranks occur. IIT Roorkee has also noted that OCI/PIO (I) candidates are not eligible for any reserved category benefits, except under OPEN-PwD if applicable. They must qualify strictly in the OPEN lists. To be eligible, candidates must have been born on or after October 1, 2001. A relaxation of five years applies to SC, ST and PwD candidates, meaning they should have been born on or after October 1, 1996. Additionally, a candidate can appear for JEE Advanced only twice in two consecutive years, meaning prior attempts must fall within this two-year window. The exam maintains its long-standing rule of allowing only two attempts in two consecutive years. This means students must plan their Class 12 and JEE Main timelines carefully, as any earlier appearance than 2025 immediately disqualifies them from appearing in 2026.

Instead, the highest-ranked students overwhelmingly prefer central government institutions like PGIMER, other AIIMS-affiliated hospitals, JIPMER, and long-established state-run colleges such as Madras Medical College (MMC), Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC), and KEM Mumbai. Since 2016, the Centre has been releasing a list of top colleges under various categories, including medical. In these nine years, AIIMS Delhi has been the undisputed number 1 . The trend, visible year after year, raises an important question: if NIRF rankings claim to evaluate the “best” institutions, then why are students opting otherwise? And what does this reveal about the effectiveness and limitations of India’s most publicised ranking mechanism for higher education? The NEET-PG 2025 round 1 allotment list reinforces the same trend seen every year: top-ranked candidates choose Central and state government medical colleges, not the private institutions ranked higher on the NIRF list.

Mechanics, waves, optics, electromagnetism — all of it returns, only deeper. The first year of both degrees is almost identical. If school physics made sense, you’ll be fine. If it didn’t… at least now you know early. The split starts in second year. EE is for students who like opening gadgets just to see what lives inside. It moves straight into circuits, electronics, motors, power systems, communication engineering, sensors, and robotics. Those neat textbook diagrams finally become real lab devices — the kind the instructor warns you not to drop because “this one is expensive.” In EE, you finally understand: – Why radio stations sit 0.2 MHz apart – Why ABS reacts before you even realise the tyre slipped- Why mobile antennas are tiny but radio antennas look like towers – How a prosthetic arm reads muscle activity Everything leads to real-world use. You build machines and circuits, test them, debug them, and watch them run. That is EE’s biggest strength — you see results quickly. Career options are wide, starting from consumer electronics, renewable energy, automobiles, telecom, defence, aviation, medical devices, manufacturing, power plants, and roles in ISRO or Tesla-type companies.

In a first, the Ministry has shared a total of 6,28,305 (6.28 lakh) are enrolled at the school-level.

This reversal comes at a time when several major destination countries have undergone significant policy shifts and diplomatic fluctuations affecting Indian student mobility over the past two years.

Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system. To support their continued learning, NIOS enables such students to rejoin formal schooling in their parent institution once they successfully complete Class 10 through NIOS, said the Minister in the Rajya Sabha . The failing rate case also stands true for Class 10 students.

The minister’s reply addressed queries related to the scale of vacancies, delays in recruitment, and the possibility of regularising contractual staff, outlining what is currently among the largest public-sector hiring exercises in the country. According to Vaishnaw, vacancies in the Railways arise on a continuous basis due to the organisation’s vast workforce, ongoing technological upgrades and operational expansion.

In 2024, a total of 10 major CENs were issued covering 92,116 vacancies. Recruitment for another 28,463 posts under the 2025 calendar has already commenced. Together, these account for the 1,20,579 vacancies currently under process. The Ministry also clarified that manpower planning is aligned with operational requirements, mechanisation and innovation across railway zones. It added that no instances of question paper leaks or examination malpractices have been reported so far.

The new law will take effect next year, making Chile the latest country to restrict smartphone use among young students to reduce its harmful effects and curb classroom distractions. Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year. In response to rising concerns about young people and their mental health, parents and teachers in Chile have lobbied for such a law for years, arguing that the use of smartphones impairs students’ learning and emotional development.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank.

The restriction on recruitment under the Karnataka Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Reservation of Seats in Education Institutions and Appointments of Posts and Services under the State) Act, 2022, will remain until further orders. However, the HC bench allowed the government to continue recruitment processes already notified before November 19, 2025, even if they follow the increased reservation percentages. The court also clarified that all appointments made through these ongoing recruitments will be subject to the final outcome of the petitions challenging the law. The division bench of Chief Justice Vibhu Bakhru and Justice C M Poonacha issued the interim order on November 27 while hearing two PILs filed by Mahendra Kumar Mitra of Raichur and Mahesh of Bengaluru .

The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down. The court further stated that this interim permission to continue ongoing recruitments will not override any specific interim or final orders already passed by courts or tribunals in related matters.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits. Goa marks the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in early December, a major religious observance that can lead to localised school holidays.

The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

This is the time when most students are juggling multiple demands—revision, full-length syllabus coverage, coaching classes, test series, and the pressure to meet their own expectations. As the exam inches closer, it is natural to experience stress and a sense of urgency to perform well. Amidst all this, aspirants often look for methods that can make their preparation more effective, structured, and result-oriented. Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test. But simply taking a mock test is not enough. The real value lies in taking each mock seriously, approaching it with exam-like discipline, analysing the results with patience and depth, and learning something meaningful from every attempt.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025.

From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

Indian students weigh options amid growing uncertainty", "summary": "", "content": "–Ankit Mehra For decades, the United States has been considered the world’s most desirable higher education destination, especially in STEM fields.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

Since OPT is the bridge that enables practical experience, employability, and loan repayment, these discussions around changes signal instability and intensify risk assessments.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews.

While Paramount was assumed to be the frontrunner to acquire the storied movie studio thanks to CEO David Ellison’s connections to the Trump administration, new reporting in Bloomberg and The Hollywood Reporter suggests that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos met with President Donald Trump to discuss a potential deal in November. Trump reportedly told Sarandos that Warner Bros. should sell to the highest bidder, and the Netflix executive seems to have left the meeting convinced that the president would not immediately oppose the acquisition. After the initial stories about the meeting appeared on Sunday, Trump confirmed that the meeting took place . As for his feelings about the deal, he said, “Netflix is a great company. They’ve done a phenomenal job. Ted is a fantastic man. I have a lot of respect for him. But it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.” Bloomberg also reports that Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav was reluctant to sell the company and was surprised when Paramount began to explore an acquisition — if nothing else, he’d expected Ellison to wait until the studio completed a planned split of its movie and streaming businesses from its cable networks. Ultimately, Warner Bros. said it would consider other bids, leading to a competitive process that Netflix won — although Paramount could still keep its hat in the ring with a hostile bid.

In its first fine under the European Union’s Digital Services Act , the commission called X’s blue checkmark system “deceptive” and said the paid verification system makes users vulnerable to impersonation and scams. The commission also said X’s advertising repository failed to meet the DSA’s requirements for transparency and accessibility.

Let’s take stock. Waymo started testing its autonomous vehicles (with a safety monitor) in Philadelphia and will start manual driving to collect data in Baltimore, St. Louis, and Pittsburgh; Uber and Avride launched a robotaxi service in Dallas that will initially include a human safety operator behind the wheel; and the California Department of Motor Vehicles released revised rules that would allow companies to test and eventually deploy self-driving trucks on public highways in the state. Autonomous vehicle tech is scaling and the pace is quickening. But should it? As autonomous vehicle tech percolates into the cityscape, so has the criticism and challenges. A couple of recent incidents illustrate this point. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Waymo for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year. The agency already opened an investigation into Waymo’s performance around school buses. Then there is KitKat, the bodega cat that died after a Waymo robotaxi ran him over on October 27. The company was already facing criticism over the event. And now it might escalate thanks to new video. The NYT tracked down surveillance video that shows a woman crouching beside the Waymo trying to lure KitKat to safety before the vehicle suddenly pulled away.

At the moment, users are able to make crypto-to-crypto trades — but speaking at India Blockchain Week (IBW), Coinbase’s APAC director John O’Loghlen said the company will open up a fiat on-ramp in 2026, allowing users in India to load money and buy crypto. Coinbase opened up its services in India in 2022, and within days had to shut down support for the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment network . This move came after UPI operator National Payments Corporation (NPCI) refused to acknowledge Coinbase’s presence in the country . Later in 2023, Coinbase ceased all operations for Indian users and asked them to offload their accounts . “We had millions of customers in India, historically, and we took a very clear stance to off-board those customers entirely from overseas entities, where they were domiciled and regulated. Because we wanted to kind of burn the boats [sic], have a clean slate here. As a commercial business person wanting to make money and active users, that’s like the worst thing you can do, and so you know it wasn’t without some hesitation,” O’Loghlen said. The company started engaging with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), a government agency that oversees transactions and fraud, and eventually registered with them this year. In October, it started to onboard users through early access, and now the app is open to all users. Many Internet companies have set up their base in India hoping to tap into the world’s second-largest online user base. While social platforms and AI companies like OpenAI have found rapid growth in the market, it has been hard for crypto companies to follow the same path because of strict regulations and taxation around cryptocurrencies. India levies a 30% tax on crypto income without any loss offset and also charges 1% deduction on each transaction, which could discourage users from trading frequently.

People trust ChatGPT and anything we do will be designed to respect that.” Earlier that same day, however, Chen responded in a more apologetic tone, acknowledging that the controversy isn’t just a matter of user confusion. “I agree that anything that feels like an ad needs to be handled with care, and we fell short,” he wrote. “We’ve turned off this kind of suggestion while we improve the model’s precision.

It’s a nice feather in the cap of Gelsinger, who spent 35 years across two stints at Intel before the board showed him the door late last year owing to a lack of confidence in his turnaround plans. But the xLight deal is also shining a spotlight on a trend that’s making people in Silicon Valley quietly uncomfortable: the Trump administration taking equity stakes in strategically important companies. “What the hell happened to free enterprise?” California Governor Gavin Newsom asked at a speaking event this week, capturing the unease that’s rippling through an industry that has long prided itself on its free-market principles. Speaking at one of TechCrunch’s StrictlyVC events at Playground Global, Gelsinger — who is xLight’s executive chairman — seemed unbothered by the philosophical debate. He’s more focused on his bet that xLight can solve what he sees as the semiconductor industry’s biggest bottleneck: lithography, the process of etching microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers. The startup is developing massive “free electron lasers” powered by particle accelerators that could revolutionize chip manufacturing. If the technology works at scale, that is. “You know, I have this long-term mission to continue to see Moore’s law in the semiconductor industry,” Gelsinger said, referencing the decades-old principle that computing power should double every two years. “We think this is the technology that will wake up Moore’s law.” The xLight de", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/06/pat-gelsinger-wants-to-save-moores-law-with-a-little-help-from-the-feds/", "timestamp": 1765193427.5886493}

The startup’s co-founder and CEO Howie Liu told the NYT that this is not a pivot because it’s not about changing direction after getting something wrong. Liu said the company considered calling it a relaunch or transformation, but ultimately chose “the language of founding because the stakes feel the same.” Similarly, Handshake’s chief marketing officer Katherine Kelly said the company is trying to bring startup culture “back into an existing business.” That can also mean harder work — Kelly said handshake told employees they have to be back in the office five days a week, “operating with a pace and number of hours that is meaningful and will help us hit goals.” Topics Show your CFO the marketing proof they want!

Some of the firmest opposition has come from the Writers Guild of America, which issued a statement declaring, “This merger must be blocked.” “The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent,” the WGA said. “The outcome would eliminate jobs, push down wages, worsen conditions for all entertainment workers, raise prices for consumers, and reduce the volume and diversity of content for all viewers.” While statements from other Hollywood unions were not quite as unequivocal, they still suggested that there are “many serious questions” about the acquisition’s “impact on the future of the entertainment industry” (as the actors union SAG-AFTRA put it ). The deal came after a competitive process in which Paramount and Comcast also made bids. Paramount was trying to acquire the entire company, while Netflix will only buy the film and television studios, as well as the streaming business, after Warner Bros. moves forward with a plan to spin off its TV networks division. Initially, Paramount was seen as the frontrunner , with its ties to the Trump administration (the studio is now run by David Ellison, son of Oracle co-founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison) easing the way for regulatory approval. But even before the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount’s lawyers sent an angry letter complaining about “a tilted and unfair process,” and Netflix soon emerged publicly as the winner.

Speed, meanwhile, has more than 50 million followers (and 6 billion views ) across various platforms and is known for his dramatic behavior while livestreaming.

The petition, obtained by TechCrunch, alleges that Speed inflicted “irreparable damage” to Rizzbot. The lawsuit alleged that — and the livestream video shows that — Speed repeatedly punched Rizzbot in the face, put it in a chokehold, at one point pinned it to the couch, and threw it to the ground. “Speed absolutely knew that this was not an appropriate way to interact with a sophisticated robot and knew that such actions with inflict irreparable damage to Rizzbot,” the petition read. “These actions resulted in the total loss of the Rizzbot.” The petition read that Speed’s handling of the robot caused “complete loss of functionality,” and that Rizzbot had “significant damages” to its mouth and neck. “Additionally, the head cameras no longer function, the ports behind the neck which connect to robot’s sensors that allow it to see and hear are dead, and the robot is unstable and cannot walk straight any longer,” the petition alleges. The petition is asking for compensation for damages, including actual and lost profit, though Rizzbot’s legal team declined to comment on the dollar amount the owner is seeking.

Amazon Music has a new Spotify Wrapped knockoff this year called “ 2025 Delivered ,” which offers a summary of users’ listening stats, such as top artists, songs, and even podcasts. Notably, the platform also takes advantage of Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, by giving users a special message from their favorite artist. The feature can be found on the app by tapping on the Library tab. This year’s update features new badges for listeners to showcase. For instance, the “Trendsetter” badge is given to those who listened to trending albums early, while the “Headliner” badge honors fans who rank among the top percentage of an artist’s listeners. There are also new shareable cards designed with a “music festival” theme, tailored specifically for each listener. Previously, Amazon Music’s equivalent of Spotify Wrapped was “My Year in Review,” a playlist featuring 50 to 100 of the most popular tracks based on your yearly statistics. The playlist is available in the “Playlists” section or “Made For You.” Apple’s music streaming service Apple Music first rolled out its “ Replay ” experience in 2019. The feature offers a summary of top songs, artists, albums, genres, playlists, and stations, including play counts, total time spent listening, and other insights.

It comes after a $13.7 million Series A round announced in May, bringing the startup’s total funding to nearly $60 million. As AI tools spread into workplaces and fuel fears of automation, Yoodli positions itself differently.

Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher “headline” valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors. Aaru and Redpoint Ventures didn’t respond to a request for comment. The exact round size couldn’t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million. Aaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles. The startup’s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events.

Software recalls have become more common in the age of modern passenger vehicles — and now robotaxis — in which operations are handled by software. These updates, or fixes, are often made prior to the official recall but still carry weight when filed with the federal government. Waymo’s decision follows increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism by officials in Atlanta and Austin over how its robotaxis perform around school buses. NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into Waymo in October after seeing footage of its autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. Other similar incidents popped up in Austin, where the company also operates a robotaxi service with partner Uber. Austin School District officials contend, in a letter available on NHTSA’s website, that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software.

NHTSA said in the letter it has received 62 complaints from Tesla drivers, 14 reports submitted by Tesla, and four media reports that describe potential violations. That’s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it opened an investigation into the behavior in October. The federal safety agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla’s driver assistance software can “accurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,” according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla’s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla’s responses are due January 19, 2026. The increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already “taken action to address the issue at this intersection.” The agency didn’t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts its own submissions to the agency. The new letter was sent to Tesla the same week that CEO Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that the latest version of FSD will allow drivers to text and drive while using the driver assistance software, which is illegal in nearly every state. NHTSA has not responded to requests for comment about Musk’s statement. The letter is meant to kick off the discovery process for NHTSA, and as such it details a number of requests for information the agency has made to Tesla. For instance, the agency is asking for data on how many Tesla vehicles are equipped with FSD, as well as how often the software is engage", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/feds-find-more-complaints-of-teslas-fsd-running-red-lights-and-crossing-lanes/", "timestamp": 1765193428.6830587}

A few years earlier, he had lost 40 pounds with the help of an Apple Watch, which counted steps and tracked his calorie burn, and he began wondering if there was a similar device to assess his stress. “I wanted to lose 40 pounds of stress, and realized there’s no wearable for that today,” Forenza told TechCrunch. That’s when Forenza realized he’d stumbled onto a gap in the consumer health market. Drawing on his engineering background, he decided to build the device himself, using a more than century-old technology: the electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect and measure electrical activity in the brain. While EEG is used clinically to diagnose diseases such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, it can also detect psychological stress by measuring high-frequency brain waves called beta waves. When those rapid beta waves persist for extended periods, they can lead to exhaustion, insomnia, and mental distress. Forenza collaborated with data scientists and biomedical engineers to develop Awear , a small device worn behind the ear for continuous brainwave monitoring. The device transmits results to an app, which provides information about the wearer’s mood and offers AI-powered coaching advice for managing stress and improving emotional resilience. “Our brain is phenomenal at self-adjusting and makes us believe we are not stressed,” Forenza said. “It’s fine to be in ‘fight or flight’ every once in a while. It’s part of our nature. But if you fall into the trap of constant ‘fight or flight’, then that leads to chronic stress, depression, anxiety.” Forenza claims that Awear helps users proactively intercept excessive stress before it leads to negative health effects .

SpaceX has not responded to a request for comment; the WSJ not did report on the scale of the offering. The eye-popping figure reflects how routine mega-valuations have become within private markets. OpenAI stands at $500 billion, while Anthropic reportedly surged last month to $350 billion following major investments from Microsoft and Nvidia, up from $183 billion just months earlier. These companies can now achieve public-market-scale valuations while remaining private, fueled by secondary sales that provide liquidity without the scrutiny of quarterly earnings reports. SpaceX, founded in 2002, dominates commercial rocket launches and operates Starlink, its satellite internet service with over 8 million customers globally as of November.

The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year. Customers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software “Rewind,” which recorded users’ desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record. The startup, founded by Brett Bejcek and Dan Siroker, the co-founder and former chief executive of Optimizely , pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another ( not very well-received ) AI pendant known as Friend . According to Limitless’ announcement, the company shares in Meta’s vision to “bring personal superintelligence to everyone,” which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life — which likely means supporting Meta’s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup. The company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too. “When we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,” wrote Siroker in the announcement. “AI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different.

There's such a rush of books at the end of the year that I usually make a couple stacks at the far end of my desk, then attack them methodically, but this book was different. The cover was inviting, like I landed in a party where the drinks and people looked fun and beautiful, and at the same time it immediately started answering questions about the food and culture. Amazingly, that serendipity happened five times this fall. What makes this group of books unique is that they are all artistic big swings. It’s almost like the authors, photographers, editors, and art department folks stood in a circle, put their hands in the middle, counted to three, and shouted \"go for broke!' There have been isolated versions of similar greatness in the last few years, often in surprising corners of the cookbook kingdom. Recent favorites from the last few years include Koreaworld , Korean American , Start Here , Oaxaca , Big Dip Energy , and maybe even Molly Baz's trippy More Is More . The resulting efforts opened me up like a favorite piece of art, making me happy and making learning effortless, everything working together to draw me in further. My hope is that this is the start of a new way forward, because once you start comparing this bunch with older cookbooks, or those from publishers with rigid and repetitive styles, those quickly start to look boring. This year's bumper crop looks at salsa, instant ramen noodles, drinking culture, a country, and home baking. Subtle they aren't, but they get you cooking, eating, drinking, and dreaming, which sounds like cookbook perfection to me. More really is more. Enjoy!

Runners laced up one of the few models available and made it work, whatever the terrain. However, in 2025, it’s all very different. We now have running shoes tailored to every type of run: daily trainers, carbon racers, easy-day recovery shoes, speed session super trainers, tempo shoes. Trail running isn’t immune to the endless subcategories, and the newest niche is gravel shoes—a subset of trail running shoes designed specifically for mixed-terrain runs across compacted gravel paths, forest roads, hard-pack trails, and regular old roads. But are the brands just repackaging trail running shoes with smaller lugs? Or do gravel shoes genuinely offer something new and different? Here’s everything you need to know about trail’s latest footwear trend. (Check out our guides to hiking boots or if you should wear hiking boots or trail runners for more.) Salomon REI (Men's) REI (Women's) Backcountry (Men's) Backcountry (Women's) If you’re recently been scouting for the best running shoes for trail, chances are you’ll have stumbled across gravel shoes. You’d be forgiven for wondering what they are. Gravel running shoes are basically hybrid running shoes built to handle multiterrain runs. They’re designed to let you run off-road—just not too far off the beaten track and certainly not onto the trickiest mountain slopes. The big selling point: They’re versatile enough to cruise compacted gravel (of course), forest tracks, hard-packed park and river paths, light uneven trails, and even the road commute to get there. “Gravel is a fairly new category,” says Taylor Bodin, chief trail shoe tester for Believe in the Run . “It is meant to be versatile in the sense that it can traverse lighter terrain more efficiently. This could mean anything from a door-to-trail shoe to a light trail shoe.” Gravel shoes blend the technologies and design of road and trail, mixing some of the cushion, impact pr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-gravel-running-shoes/", "timestamp": 1765193430.2963448}

Players walk clockwise in a circle. When the music stops, everyone sits in a chair. Big Tech is setting in motion its plans for the next gen of lead designers, engineers, AI chiefs, and even CEOs. In Cupertino, Apple execs with familiar faces are retiring or reducing responsibilities. Who’s in and who’s out? Well, chief operating officer Jeff Williams retired in November, and the speculation is that CEO Tim Cook could follow in the near term. Lisa Jackson, who has led Apple’s sustainability efforts since 2013, is now set to retire in January too. There’s also the squad of Apple staffers who have been lured away to work with OpenAI , notably Apple’s former chief design officer Jony Ive after his independent stint at LoveFrom . In 2024, Molly Anderson was named industrial design leader, heading up a team of mostly fresh faces. Others have gone to Meta, such as Apple’s VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, who just this week was poached to head up a new Reality Labs design studio. At Apple, he’s been replaced by long-time UI designer Stephen Lemay. Phew. In this swirl of shifting talent, John Ternus, who has worked for Apple since 2001, and served as SVP of hardware engineering for the last four years, reporting directly to Tim Cook, is emerging as the frontrunner to succeed Cook as Apple CEO, reportedly as soon as next year. WIRED asked Apple for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. Alongside a steady drip of “leaks” on succession planning and Ternus’ position at the front of the pack, since 2023, Ternus has been given more prominence at product launch events. He announced the iPhone Air onstage this past September, and has appeared alongside other senior Apple leaders in press interviews and in-store Apple events. “I think they're testing to see what sentiment is like.

Here’s a test for infants: Show them a glass of water on a desk. Hide it behind a wooden board. Now move the board toward the glass. If the board keeps going past the glass, as if it weren’t there, are they surprised? Many 6-month-olds are, and by a year, almost all children have an intuitive notion of an object’s permanence, learned through observation. Now some artificial intelligence models do too. Researchers have developed an AI system that learns about the world via videos and demonstrates a notion of “surprise” when presented with information that goes against the knowledge it has gleaned. The model, created by Meta and called Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), does not make any assumptions about the physics of the world contained in the videos. Nonetheless, it can begin to make sense of how the world works. “Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting,” says Micha Heilbron , a cognitive scientist at the University of Amsterdam who studies how brains and artificial systems make sense of the world. As the engineers who build self-driving cars know, it can be hard to get an AI system to reliably make sense of what it sees. Most systems designed to “understand” videos in order to either classify their content (“a person playing tennis,” for example) or identify the contours of an object—say, a car up ahead—work in what’s called “pixel space.” The model essentially treats every pixel in a video as equal in importance. But these pixel-space models come with limitations. Imagine trying to make sense of a suburban street. If the scene has cars, traffic lights and trees, the model might focus too much on irrelevant details such as the motion of the leaves. It might miss the color of the traffic light, or the positions of nearby cars. “When you go to images or video, you don’t want to work in [pixel] space because there are too many details you d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-one-ai-model-creates-a-physical-intuition-of-its-environment/", "timestamp": 1765193430.5190203}

Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider ) had \"Norwegian kaiju\" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating \"Megatroll\" it has locked away. Soon, Nora—reunited with allies Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Major Kris Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen)—is caught in another desperate race to prevent a trollpocalypse. This time though, there's an edge of Indiana Jones at work, with a madcap ancient conspiracy to decode alongside the troll-smashing action. Troll 2 is a bit more tongue-in-cheek than its predecessor, and ventures into so-bad-it's-good territory in places, but it knows exactly what it is and what it's offering: giant rock monsters beating the boulders off of each other.

You could take all of your games with you, install mods and custom software, or even plug into a hub and get some work done. Lenovo is taking another swing at the Windows handheld game with the Legion Go 2, undeterred by mixed reviews on the original Legion Go and streamlined Legion Go S . But even a snappier interface and versatile input methods can’t overcome a lot of the barriers inherent to running Windows on a device with no keyboard. If you’re willing to put in the work, or you already love your original Legion Go, the performance, screen, and software support have all improved. If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I’d recommend picking something a little lower maintenance. I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand. Lenovo Go Gen 2 Rating: 7/10 Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings. It’s unique, and the easy access to a mouse and right-click without using the touchpad is a nice bonus, but the way you grip the controller means you're always kind of palming the joystick on the side.

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain . By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity . The present crisis reflects not only this summer’s extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry. The drought quickly disrupted Tehran’s urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank . Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation , and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved . These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran’s infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress. These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer. Over the past five years, precipitation during this wet period has remained consistently below the long-term climatological baseline, with the 2024-25 season showing the most pronounce", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/why-tehran-is-running-out-of-water-iran-climate-change-drought-extreme-weather/", "timestamp": 1765193431.0341432}

Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept —a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell. British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing. Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new . Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn’t until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings. Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet Rating: 9/10 RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila! The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company’s name, RLS, or “Relea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/canyon-deflectr-rls-bike-helmet/", "timestamp": 1765193431.2681363}

The lowest tier contains cheap machines one would buy as a housewarming present for a friend or relative’s third or fourth property, like a timeshare in the country or a freshly christened yacht. The second-lowest is a mandatory gift for someone you don’t know well or care for very much, such as the wedding of a distant cousin or former nemesis. The third tier is a gift for someone you know and like, and the fourth is a treat yo’ self gift you bestow upon yourself after finishing a large project, landing a promotion at work, or finally turning a profit at your bespoke AI-powered marketing and SEO agency. Gevi’s imaginatively named Espresso Machine lands at the high end of the second tier. This single-boiler, 15-bar machine performs essential functions like grinding coffee, pulling shots, and steaming milk at a level that’s acceptable for its cost.

Zoë Schiffer: Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley . I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week, including how despite some reports claiming that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is pretty much over, DOGE people are actually still at work across federal agencies. I'm joined today by our senior politics editor, Leah Feiger. Leah, welcome back to Uncanny Valley . Leah Feiger: Thanks so much, Zoë. How are you doing today? Zoë Schiffer: I am great because I've spent the day with you, but our gentle listeners don't know that. Today's a good day. Let's dive right in. So the first story this week is one that I saw and I thought, you know what? Leah's going to want to talk about Amazon's artificial intelligence prowess. Leah Feiger: That's all I ever want to talk about. Zoë Schiffer: I know. I know. But I'm actually going to make a hard pitch for you right now. Leah Feiger: OK. Hit me.

But Horses fails to meet the lofty goals of its own ideas.", "content": "Shortly before the December 2 release of horror game Horses , developer Santa Ragione shared some news: The game would not be available on Valve’s mega platform, Steam . Valve had already banned an early, incomplete version of the game two years ago and offered, according to Santa Ragione , little clarification about why at the time. Then, hours before the game’s release, the Epic Games Store banned Horses as well. A day after the game’s launch, distribution platform Humble removed, and then later relisted, the title. The public swiftly spoke out against these bans, and community support for the game’s developers has been plentiful. Many pieces have been written online about how the game doesn’t deserve to be shunned by the distribution platforms, and about how the game’s content is relatively tame . But too few of these pieces engage with the content of the game on a critical level. Horses ’ storytelling is clumsy, and its blasé treatment of the sexual assaults (plural!) depicted in the game fails to elevate the game beyond more than a lazy commentary of sexual repression. It’s difficult to untangle the circumstances and controversy surrounding the game’s release from the content of the game itself. As a writer, I think censorship of creative work is Bad. I think Horses has as much right to exist as any other game, and that the power of distribution platforms to ban and delist a game by a small studio should be a concern for everyone. But the real problem with Horses is not that it’s too audacious for what is clearly intended to be an adult audience. Horses , for all the attention around its banning, is tedious and overreliant on pseudo-intellectual ideas. It confuses its own pretension for something profound. Even its shock value eventually wears off, making its three-hour run time feel like a slog. Conversations about whether or not it deserves the scandal are ultimately useless and wholly subjective.

It also ends the streaming wars.", "content": "Close your eyes, think for a minute, and tell me: What is a Netflix Movie? OK, try again: What is a Netflix Show? Sure, it’s easy to rattle off some killer titles— KPop Demon Hunters , Stranger Things —but Netflix has never really had a brand identity. It’s not, like Disney , the home of Star Wars and Mickey Mouse. As streaming services go, it’s made its name by being a jack of all trades and a master of none. Now, it’s made its smartest move yet, dropping $83 billion to buy itself a whole new personality. On Friday, the streaming giant announced it will be acquiring Warner Bros. in a deal that gives Netflix the studio’s film and television operations as well as HBO and HBO Max. For those who can’t keep up with who owns what these days—no one can—that means that once the deal closes, Netflix will own everything from Batman to The Big Bang Theory , The Wizard of Oz to Westeros . Also, Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter , and prestige TV shows like The Sopranos. According to Paul Erickson, a media and entertainment analyst at Omdia, acquiring content with that kind of name recognition will allow Netflix to attract and retain subscribers. “It will also increase Netflix’s standing within the industry from talent, recruitment, and salary negotiation perspectives,” he added. The deal, which is expected to close next fall after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable business (CNN, HGTV, Discovery, and others), surprised the hell out of Hollywood when Netflix announced it Friday morning. Warner Bros. Discovery’s future had been hanging in the balance for weeks, with a series of potential buyers putting in offers. NBCUniversal parent company Comcast made a bid. So did Paramount Skydance—which worried some, given that the merger of Paramount and Skydance, headed up by Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s son David Ellison , became a political football involving everything from South Park to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert , which got put on ice this summer.

We have liked everything we've tried from Silk & Snow, and right now the company is hosting a Cyber Week Sale that runs through December 7. You can save on some of our favorite bed frames and mattresses that we've tested long-term in our own homes, and if you prefer to browse on your own, the sale offers up to 35 percent off site-wide. I've rounded up the highlights on WIRED-tested gear below. Silk & Snow Silk & Snow In our Bed Frame Buying Guide , I say that Silk & Snow could charge more for this bed frame—but right now, it's 20 percent off. Assembly is a little bit annoying. But the fabric-covered headboard is gorgeous, and the frame is sturdy. My favorite part is the drawer cleverly concealed at the foot of the frame, with its two partitions and its magnetic closure. It does feel a little jarring if you open and close the drawer while your partner is in bed, but I like having extra storage in my room, especially since this frame is too low to the ground to allow for stashing things under it. Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress The S&S Organic Mattress is the best organic latex mattress . It's very soft and offers a lot of pressure relief and support, but the responsive material means it's better suited to solo sleepers than it is to couples. It feels like a soft, dense marshmallow, per our sleep reviewer Julia Forbes , who advises using lightweight blankets and cooling sheets if you're a hot sleeper and also raved about the lengthy year-long sleep trial. As part of the Cyber Week sale, you can choose between a free sleep bundle (with a sheet set, a duvet, two microfiber pillows, and a mattress protector) or you can opt out of the bundle to get an extra 10 percent off your mattress.

Once assumed to be something that only older people might need due to perimenopause, menopause, and post-menopause, the reality is that the best lubes will make all sex-related activities much more pleasurable—no matter your age, gender, or whatever you’re into exploring. It's why you should always have lube within reach . Lube is a sexually active person’s best friend. Not only does it help prevent friction during penetration—vaginal and anal—which can lead to micro-tears and chafing, making one susceptible to possible infections, but it can be an incredible asset when giving oral sex or if you need some slippery touches during foreplay.

Lube Types: Silicone, Water, and Natural Oil There are three kinds of lubes on the market: Water-based, silicone-based, and oil-based. To make the right choice for your sex life, your lifestyle, and even your sex toys, it’s paramount to have an understanding of each. Water-based lubes are by far the most common because of their compatibility with silicone toys and latex condoms. These lubes also tend to be the most affordable—they’re water-based, after all—so you’re going to find them both online and in sex shops easily. High-quality water-based lubes may as well be called aloe-based lubes because Aloe barbadensis leaf gel is the primary thickener in almost all of them.

Three founders discuss what it takes.", "content": "Julie Bornstein thought it would be a cinch to implement her idea for an AI startup . Her résumé in digital commerce is impeccable: VP of ecommerce at Nordstrom, COO of the startup Stitch Fix, and founder of a personalized shopping platform acquired by Pinterest . Fashion has been her obsession since she was a Syracuse high schooler inhaling spreads in Seventeen and hanging out in local malls. So she felt well-positioned to create a company for customers to discover the perfect garments using AI. The reality was much harder than she expected. I had breakfast recently with Bornstein and her CTO, Maria Belousova, to learn about her startup, Daydream , funded with $50 million from VCs like Google Ventures. The conversation took an unexpected turn as the women schooled me on the surprising difficulty of translating the magic of AI systems into something people actually find useful.T Her story helps explain something. My first newsletter of 2025 announced that it would be The Year of the AI App . Though there are indeed many such apps, they haven’t transformed the world as I anticipated. Ever since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, people have been blown away by the tricks performed by AI, but study after study has shown that the technology has not yet delivered a significant boost in productivity. (One exception: coding.) A study published in August found that 19 out of 20 AI enterprise pilot projects delivered no measurable value. I do think that productivity boost is on the horizon, but it’s taking longer than people expected. Listening to the stories of startups like Daydream that are pushing to break through gives some hope that persistence and patience might indeed make those breakthroughs happen. Bornstein’s original pitch to VCs seemed obvious: Use AI to solve tricky fashion problems by matching customers with the perfect garments, which they’d be delighted to pay for.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

Look no further than the delta between the 1962 Hanna-Barbera cartoon The Jetsons —which predicted a space-age utopia replete with flying cars, automated kitchens, and robot maids—and Ridley Scott’s 1982 dystopian sci-fi hallmark Blade Runner , which portrays Los Angeles as a dreary urban hellscape overrun with crime, pollution, and android slaves gone rogue. Throw in Gattaca , The Matrix , and Her and you’re presented with a fairly certain conclusion that the technology is making things worse, not better. Alas, technocrats keep grinding away at products that aim to increase your quality of life by a few percentage points by cutting out friction and inconvenience. ZIRP-era luminaries “solved” problems like last-mile transit, the need for pesky humans to operate taxis, and the lack of true market influence on housing costs. And with liquid full-meal replacement products, they even solved the problem of cooking and chewing food! While many of these time-saving products look like protein shakes at first glance, the key difference is the addition of vitamins, plant fiber, and other “proprietary nutrient blends” that will keep your body functioning while also making you un-hungry in the morning.

A scenario where a parent asks someone on an airplane to switch seats so they can sit next to their young child is likely to invoke the same rush of anger. But those posts may trigger a Reddit moderator’s annoyance for a different reason—they are common themes within a growing genre of AI -generated, fake posts. These are examples that spring to mind for Cassie, one of dozens of moderators for r/AmItheAsshole . With over 24 million members, it's one of the biggest subreddits, and it explicitly bans AI-generated content and other made-up stories. Since late 2022, when ChatGPT first launched to the public, Cassie (who wanted to be referred to by first name only) and other people who volunteer their time to moderate Reddit posts have been struggling with an influx of AI content. Some of it is entirely AI-generated, while other users have taken to editing their posts and comments with AI programs like Grammarly. “It’s probably more prevalent than anybody wants to really admit, because it’s just so easy to shove your post into ChatGPT and say ‘Hey, make this more exciting,’” says Cassie, who thinks as much as half of all content being posted to Reddit may have been created or reworked with AI in some way. r/AmItheAsshole is a pillar of Reddit culture, a format that has inspired dozens if not hundreds of derivatives like r/AmIOverreacting, r/AmITheDevil, and r/AmItheKameena, a subreddit with over 100,000 members described as “Am I the asshole, but the Indian version.” Posts tend to feature stories about interpersonal conflicts, where Redditors can weigh in on who is wrong (“YTA” means “You’re the asshole,” while “ESH” means “Everyone sucks here”), who is right, and what the best course of action to take is moving forward.

The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1765193432.7839983}

The “overwhelming majority” of the images involved nudity and were “depicted adult content,” according to the researcher who uncovered the exposed trove of data, with some appearing to depict children or the faces of children swapped onto the AI-generated bodies of nude adults. Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos.

Thanks to its revolutionary Pleasure Air Technology that mimics the feeling of oral sex, not only has Womanizer discovered a way to stimulate the 10,000+ nerve endings in the clitoris in a way that hadn’t been done by a sex toy before—yes, they were the first—but the brand can even boast a 100% orgasm rate among users. As a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2 , both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance , the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm.

The outside general counsel for USIP, he’s been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump’s right to remove them from office.

Boomers, Hogg said, are likely the group most out of touch with their generation in Washington, DC. “You know why I say that?” Hogg said. “It's because the people that are marching by the millions right now in the No Kings Day protests are not young people. They are people of Chuck Schumer's generation that are extremely pissed off with him.” Hogg’s Schumer slams weren’t the only anti-boomer jabs he threw during his talk, likening the current makeup of Congress to the “end of the Soviet Union” when he said “leaders were dying over and over because they were so old,” and complaining about the establishment leadership in the Democratic National Committee , where Hogg was vice chair until a recent shake-up. While Hogg did concede that “there are plenty of great boomers out there,” he said part of what he’s working on as the cofounder of the group Leaders We Deserve is a shift in elected officials’ age and political focus. “What we want to do with Leaders We Deserve is not just elect younger versions of who's already there,” said Hogg. “We want to elect younger people that have the chance to actually have integrity, support them with millions of dollars, ensure that they don't take money from corporations, for example, [and ask] th", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-david-hogg/", "timestamp": 1765193433.672433}

Though he cut his product-management teeth at Google and Stripe , he was never comfortable with the industry’s increasing prioritization of profits over people. Once during his time at Google, he extolled the societal benefits of a project only to be met with, “Oh Alex, you'd be a VP by now if you just stopped thinking through the implications of your actions.” Since that 2010s episode, the revenues and valuations in tech have skyrocketed, as has the blithe disregard for users. “It’s disgusting to see the industry as it currently is,” Komoroske says. Now, he’s doing something about it. Today, Komoroske and a loose group of concerned technologists are releasing The Resonant Computing Manifesto , an idealistic set of principles that attempts to recenter Silicon Valley around the values that have been lost in the scramble to hyperscale and maximize shareholder value. Komoroske and his coauthors are inviting anyone who, um, resonates with this jeremiad to sign it and proselytize those values in the products they create. Accompanying the manifesto is a shared doc of “the theses of resonant computing” where the community itself can provide input on shared principles.

The idea for the manifesto emerged from an informal “think tank,” as Komoroske calls it, of technologists concerned about the state of Silicon Valley.

Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs. In a post on the Meta platform Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the two would lead the new studio and “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” In his own Instagram post, Sorrentino confirmed the news . (In response to a request for comment from WIRED, a Meta rep pointed toward the Threads posts by Zuckerberg and Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth .) Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface. If they want users to stay on their platform, they’re going to have to fix the UI.” The move comes as Meta continues to go absolutely all in on its AI efforts.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should. Lavingia was previously assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), where he was part of a group of technologists brought into the government in the early months of DOGE’s takeover. In 2015, he had applied to be a part of the US Digital Service (USDS), now the US DOGE Service . Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work. At the VA, Lavignia attempted to use an AI tool to write code for the agency’s systems and suggested the agency move away from paper forms entirely. He built a tool to “munch” data about the agency’s contracts to identify those that could be cut. He was fired from his role at the VA in May after he spoke to a reporter about his work at DOGE.

The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday. The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command’s classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.” The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate , because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security .

At WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday—not so coincidentally held in San Francisco—the mayor told global editorial director Katie Drummond that he’s absolutely convinced that anyone looking to rag on the city doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Of course, Lurie said, things could always be better. While he hailed positive changes that San Francisco has made since he took office 11 months ago, like more office space being filled in the downtown area and a decrease in crime, he acknowledged that some of that might have come in the wake of companies’ return-to-office policies and the AI boom. Still, Lurie said, if you ask San Francisco residents, 62 percent say that their city is headed in the right direction, compared to just 25 percent a year ago. Lurie said part of what’s going to help keep San Francisco on the right track is a commitment from residents. Past leaders, he said, “took San Francisco for granted,” thinking “we could just continue on, and our success would continue as well.” To make San Francisco resilient, able to weather economic changes and tech booms and busts, Lurie said, its leaders have to be “relentless in fighting for [their] city, standing up for [their] city, and welcoming people, saying, ‘We want you here, and we're going to create the conditions for your success.’” But while San Francisco is often cited as a city for the ultra-rich—like the tech CEOs who have lobbied for the city in Washington and like the mayor himself, who has a connection to the Levi Strauss fortune—Lurie said he wants to push toward making his city more affordable, stressing that he wants kids who are born in San Francisco today to be able to live comfortably in the city for the rest of their lives.

But It Might Not Work", "summary": "By rolling back auto industry fuel efficiency goals, US president Donald Trump hopes to make new cars cheaper. But prices won’t drop for years, and consumers will spend more on gas in the meantime.", "content": "The Trump administration says its proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, announced officially in the Oval Office on Wednesday, is an attempt to shave dollars off the ballooning cost of new cars in the US. But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change. The Biden administration took a carrot-and-stick approach to vehicles and their effect on the environment. Light-duty cars and trucks alone are responsible for some 15 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The previous administration tried to boost electric vehicle adoption by using tax subsidies for consumers and manufacturers interested in building fuel-efficient vehicles and technologies, including batteries. It also introduced penalties for those unable or unwilling to meet stricter environmental standards. Automakers should be able to hit next decade’s goals by selling more electric vehicles, the government then reasoned.

That’s when women are supposed to start getting mammograms and men are supposed to start paying a bit more attention to their prostates.

Is there a way that, even as we age, we can stay healthy in a way that’s both meaningful and not reliant on taking 12 horse-sized pills every morning? Eric Topol certainly thinks so. The cardiologist, vice president of Scripps Research, and author of Super Agers is convinced that new innovations in AI-assisted medicine, bioengineering, and anti-inflammatory awareness could have potential to revolutionize the way people age. During WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday, Topol told features editor Sandra Upson that while he was working on Super Agers he learned that there’s a difference between lifespan and health span and that neither has much to do with genetics. Someone who’s “wellderly,” or over 65 and generally healthy, has pretty much the same genetic makeup as someone who’s elderly and facing major health challenges, like heart disease, cancer, or a neurodegenerative disorder. Instead, Topol said, there appears to be a correlation between having a healthy immune system and aging healthily.

And that's why we talk about it so much.” More than 300,000 startups, developers, and companies use some version of Anthropic’s Claude model and Amodei said that, through the company’s dealings with those brands, she’s learned that, while customers want their AI to be able to do great things, they also want it to be reliable and safe. “No one says, ‘We want a less safe product,’” Amodei said, likening Anthropic’s reporting of its model’s limits and jailbreaks to that of a car company releasing crash-test studies to show how it has addressed safety concerns. It might seem shocking to see a crash-test dummy flying through a car window in a video, but learning that an automaker updated their vehicle’s safety features as a result of that test could sell a buyer on a car. Amodei said the same goes for companies using Anthropic’s AI products, making for a market that is somewhat self-regulating. “We’re setting what you can almost think of as minimum safety standards just by what we’re putting into the economy,” she said. Companies “are now building many workflows and day-to-day tooling task", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-daniela-amodei-anthropic/", "timestamp": 1765193434.7258193}

OpenAI’s Sam Altman has often talked about a possible billion-dollar company being spun up with just one human and an army of AI agents.

Chu Says AI Couldn’t Have Made One of the Best Moments in ‘Wicked’", "summary": "The Wicked: For Good director says being able to improvise on set allows for the kind of moments that are hard for machines to make.", "content": "If there’s anyone who understands the importance of viral marketing, it’s Wicked: For Good director Jon M. Chu . At WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco, the onetime YouTuber and Crazy Rich Asians director said that working with acts like Justin Bieber taught him the value of connecting with fans online during the creation process. While directing Bieber’s concert film, Never Say Never , in the late aughts, Chu said the then-14-year-old star used Twitter to introduce Chu to fans. After Bieber posted a clip joking that the director was following him around on set, Chu told WIRED’s senior culture editor, Manisha Krishnan, he began to watch his online followers grow by tens of thousands of people almost instantly, something that really drove home the power of direct connection with a fan base. Working with Bieber, Chu said, made him realize that “the story is being told before you even start shooting, and after you’re done with the movie, you have to continue that story.” That’s why he believes fans have felt so invested in Wicked —and its sequel, Wicked: For Good —and why the movie’s marketing and press tours have leaned so heavily on the relationships built by the cast while filming. Bonds, like the one between stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, came from the immense pressure the crew felt to make something not only great but also bankable. “We only had each other, so we’re very, very bonded,” Chu said, likening the relationship to that of Silicon Valley developers working long hours together to deliver a new product. A Bay Area native, Chu said he has always felt partially indebted to the tech world for his start in entertainment. In the ’90s, when Chu was just a teenager, tech-minded customers at his parents’ Chinese restaurant would slip him computers, video cards, and software when they heard he was interested in filmmaking, giving him a leg up on fellow students when he went to college at the University of Southern California. “I was built by the gen", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-jon-chu-wicked/", "timestamp": 1765193434.955511}

OK, we’re not going to sugarcoat it: As far as MCU movies go, Madame Web is one of the series’ worst (it currently holds an 18 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes). It’s impossible to deny that some of the creative decisions made were very bad ones—so much so that even star Dakota Johnson has publicly voiced her disappointment in the project. But the movie has also got a handful of things going for it: namely, the always-captivating Johnson in the title role. (Plus Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, Tahar Rahim, Mike Epps, Emma Roberts, and Adam Scott.) While the execution is far from perfect, it does offer a fresh take on a superhero origin story. In this case, New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb’s (Johnson) newfound ability to see the future—and change it. At a time when the business of news is changing, and journalists are coming under fire from high-ranking political figures, Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Lynsey Addario is a testament to the importance of a free press.

Authorities identified the man as Brian J. Cole Jr., a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. The arrest marks a major break in a case that has vexed authorities for nearly five years. Cole, 30, is charged with transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, intimidate, or destroy property and with attempting to damage and destroy the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees by means of an explosive device. If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison. According to an affidavit , investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Cole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day. Senior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it. “Though it had been nearly five ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/", "timestamp": 1765193435.1918726}

When asked at WIRED’s Big Interview event if AI is a bubble, the company’s CEO said, “Emphatically, from my perspective, no.”", "content": "Earlier this year, WIRED said that AMD CEO Lisa Su was “ out for Nvidia’s blood .” The American chipmaker is still small compared to the juggernaut that is Nvidia—their market caps are $353 billion and $4.4 trillion, respectively—but Su’s company is gaining steam. Today, when Su took the stage at WIRED’s Big Interview conference in San Francisco, she had something else in her sights: the AI bubble . When asked by WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode if the tech industry is in an AI bubble, her response was “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” The AI industry is going to need scores of chips from companies like AMD, and fears of such a bubble, Su said, are “somewhat overstated.” That might sound bold, but boldness is Su’s whole deal. Since she became AMD’s CEO in 2014, she has increased the company’s market cap from $2 billion to $300 billion. Now, Su is betting big on the need for much more computing power for AI, and the data centers needed to provide that. Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead for AMD. One is all of those data centers being built, and another is getting its chips out into the hands of as many customers as possible. During the discussion, Goode asked the AMD CEO about selling chips to China. She confirmed that AMD will pay a 15 percent tax instituted by the Trump administration on MI308 chips it plans to resume shipping to China. The US government previously halted sales of the chips to China, but then began reviewing applications again over the summer. AMD said earlier this year that US export restrictions on the MI308 chips would cost the company roughly $800 million. Earlier this year, AMD made a huge deal with OpenAI, under which the AI company will deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD’s Instinct GPUs over the course of several years. As part of the deal, AMD agreed to allow OpenAI to buy 160 million shares of the company’s stock for a penny per share. effectively giving it a 10 percent stake in the company.

This story explains how it happens, why it matters, and how you can enjoy tea without putting your health at risk. Think of it as a gentle guide told in a friendly, clear voice. Tea contains natural compounds called tannins which bind to non heme iron in plant based foods. This makes your body absorb less iron. Research in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows tannins can reduce iron absorption by up to 60 percent in some meals. Iron helps your blood carry oxygen to every cell. When levels drop, your body works harder, leading to tiredness and weakness. It may feel subtle at first which is why many people miss it until symptoms become harder to ignore. Early signs often include persistent fatigue, pale skin and a sense of breathlessness during simple tasks. Some people experience headaches or trouble concentrating. These symptoms can mimic everyday stress which is why they often go unnoticed. Drinking strong black tea with meals or drinking more than four large cups a day increases the risk of iron depletion. People who rely on mostly plant based iron sources are more vulnerable because their iron is already less absorbable. Drink tea between meals, not with them. Add vitamin C rich foods like oranges or strawberries to improve iron absorption. Choose lighter brews when possible. Small changes help you enjoy tea while keeping your iron levels steady and resilient. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/this-nutrient-gets-blocked-when-you-drink-too-much-tea-and-it-may-be-harming-your-blood-health/slideshow/125833498.cms", "timestamp": 1765193456.019718}

Surprisingly, it’s not always what you eat — sometimes it’s how you combine foods. Certain pairings slow digestion or trigger gas, leaving you with discomfort, heaviness or a bloated tummy. Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt) digests slowly. Starches like bread or pasta take time too. Pairing them together — or combining protein-rich meals with fresh fruit — can slow digestion. The lag can cause fermentation, gas, heaviness, and bloating. Combining two or more proteins — like meat with beans, or eggs with dairy — forces the digestive system to work harder. Beans plus cheese or dairy adds fermentable fibre to heavy protein and lactose, increasing gas and causing bloating. Heavy and fatty foods already slow digestion. When paired with carbonated drinks (soda, sparkling drinks), the extra gas from the drink adds to digestion troubles. This combo often results in bloating, belching, and abdominal discomfort.  ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/-3-food-pairing-mistakes-that-quietly-upset-your-gut/slideshow/125833070.cms", "timestamp": 1765193459.392246}

It breaks down the science in simple language with one real journal reference and offers practical tips that anyone can apply with ease and clarity.​", "content": "Ocean waves and forest ambience help many people unwind because they lower mental load and create gentle predictability. These sounds do not force your brain to stay alert. They help you slip into a calmer state that makes sleep feel more inviting and less pressured. The brain relaxes faster when it hears steady natural sounds because they reduce sudden shifts in attention. These patterns smooth out racing thoughts and let your mind drift toward sleep with less effort. This gentle auditory cushion makes it easier to move into deeper rest. Ocean waves offer rhythmic consistency while forest sounds add soft variation. When combined, they create a balanced soundscape that feels familiar and safe. This blend gently masks unwanted noise so the brain can release tension without feeling overwhelmed or overstimulated. Deep sleep, which is called slow wave sleep, is the stage where the brain repairs itself. According to a 2017 study in Scientific Reports, pink noise increased slow wave activity in adults. Nature sounds that mimic these steady patterns may support smoother transitions into deep sleep. When external noise stays consistent your brain stops scanning for threats. This predictability helps stabilize the sleep cycle. With fewer interruptions your deep sleep periods remain more intact which can leave you feeling restored instead of foggy. Use low volume nature audio and keep it consistent each night. A simple loop that does not fluctuate too much works best. Pair it with a dark cool room so your senses collaborate instead of competing. Small adjustments like these often lead to clearer morning energy.  ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/ocean-waves-forest-noise-can-soothing-sounds-truly-deepen-your-sleep/slideshow/125832502.cms", "timestamp": 1765193461.498722}

But timing matters too. Water at wrong times can disrupt digestion, sleep or even body balance. Let us explore when water becomes a hidden trouble, and why skipping a drink at those wrong times could actually help you feel better. Drinking a lot of water right before sleep often leads to nighttime bathroom trips. This disrupts your sleep cycle and rest — leaving you tired or unfocused next day. Drinking lots of water immediately before or after a meal can dilute digestive juices or stomach acids. That can slow digestion, cause bloating or mild indigestion. Consuming large amounts in one go — instead of spacing water across the day — may overwhelm your body. Too much water too fast can disturb your fluid balance. Drinking excessively without regard to need can lower sodium levels in blood. This may trigger nausea, dizziness or even more serious issues like hyponatremia in extreme cases. Better to sip water regularly through the day, not in big gulp. Drink before meals (but not right at mealtime) or wait about 30 minutes after you eat. And stop heavy fluid intake at least 1–2 hours before bed. ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.) ​ Log In/Connect with: Will be displayed Will not be displayed Will be displayed", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/drinking-water-can-do-more-harm-than-good-bad-times-to-hydrate/slideshow/125830208.cms", "timestamp": 1765193473.849858}

The crisis in pictures.", "content": "IndiGo crisis: India’s civil aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has issued a show-cause notice to Pieter Elbers, the CEO of InterGlobe Aviation, the parent company and operator of IndiGo, demanding an explanation for one of the country's most severe air travel disruptions. IndiGo , which commands nearly 66% of the domestic aviation market, cancelled hundreds of flights last week, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across major Indian airports. The crisis was triggered by an acute pilot shortage, as the airline failed to adequately prepare for new, stricter pilot duty rules, which mandate increased rest hours, effective 1 November. The airline confirmed its planning failure, stating it did not make timely arrangements to implement the stricter regulations governing night flying and weekly pilot rest. This misstep, compounded by the December peak travel season for holidays and weddings, led to the immediate collapse of its flight roster. In the notice issued on Saturday, the DGCA asserted that CEO Elbers \"failed\" in his duty to “ensure timely arrangements for conduct of reliable operations and the availability of requisite facilities to the passengers.” In response to the crisis, IndiGo's stock plummeted by as much as 8% on Monday, marking its steepest decline in eight months. The airline initially expressed confidence that normal operations would stabilize by Wednesday, but the civil aviation watchdog gave the company only 24 hours to explain why it should not face regulatory action. Concurrently, Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu announced that the government is launching an inquiry into the matter, promising to take action that will \"set an example\" for all airlines. Blaming the airlines for its failure to manage the crew and duty roster through its day-to-day operations, Naidu said: “We are not taking this situation easily. We are doing an inquiry. We will take very, very strict action not only for this situation but", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/indigo-meltdown-in-pics-baggages-pile-up-thousands-stranded-airport-scenes-paint-a-grim-picture-11765185144472.html", "timestamp": 1765193475.318749}

This opportunity comes after recent solar activity, including a coronal mass ejection (CME) and disturbances in Earth’s magnetic field. The event coincides with the Geminid meteor shower, one of 2025’s most prominent annual celestial shows, which is expected to gain intensity ahead of its peak next weekend. NOAA has issued a G1-rated geomagnetic storm alert. Although this is the lowest level on the geomagnetic scale, it is still strong enough to expand aurora visibility to areas farther south than usual. Officials noted that the auroral oval could stretch across up to 12 US states, if skies are clear and light pollution is minimal. The geomagnetic disturbance originates from a CME that left the sun on December 4, shortly after an M6-class solar flare. CMEs are clouds of fast-moving charged particles that can distort Earth’s magnetic field and create vivid auroral displays near the poles. Spaceweather.com reports that a large sunspot facing Earth is currently active and capable of releasing major solar flares, which may further enhance aurora sightings through next week. Aurora visibility may be affected by the waning gibbous moon. The moon reached its full supermoon phase on December 4, and although its brightness is now decreasing, it may still make faint auroras difficult to see with the naked eye. Nevertheless, amateur astronomers and photographers using long-exposure cameras might capture subtle glows. This week’s auroral activity coincides with the Geminid meteor shower, which started on December 4 and continues until December 17. The shower is expected to peak on the night of December 13–14, according to the American Meteor Society, as reported by Forbes.

The latest earthquake comes around a month after another tremor had rattled Turkey. As per multiple social media posts, the earthquake was widely felt across the Antalya Province. Videos showed doors and windows shaking as a result of the seismic activity. No serious damage or injuries have been reported so far.  Earlier this year – in October – anothe r earthquake of magnitude 4.7 struck Turkey , as per the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) said on Thursday. The quake was recorded at a depth of 10km, GFZ further said. Initially pegged to be a 5.33 magnitude quake. The GFZ later downgraded it, Reuters reported. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and greater casualties.

A fan breached security, jumped onto the stage, and grabbed her, triggering serious safety concerns. The incident occurred while Kanika was performing one of her songs, when a man from the crowd suddenly climbed onto the stage and clutched her legs. Kanika Kapoor was in the middle of her performance – singing the Bollywood hit – ‘Kala Chashma’ when a fan appeared on stage – grabbed the singer by her legs – in what looked like an attempt to pick her up from the stage. A video of the incident, which quickly went viral on social media, shows security personnel quickly intervened, escorting the intruder away as the visibly shaken crowd watched in shock. Kanika regained her composure and continued the performance without stopping. The unsettling episode sparked outrage online, with several users condemning the breach and calling for stricter security at live concerts. One social media user wrote: “In India, women are not safe even on stage in front of thousands of people.” Another Instagrammer reacted angrily, saying, “What was he trying to do—grab her, molest her, lift her? This is unacceptable. Such people should be jailed.” This is not the first time that a singer has faced harassment on stage. A similar thing happened to American singer Akon, who was in Bengaluru last month for his India Tour. A night that was expected to be full of energy and nostalgia during Akon’s Bengaluru stop on his India Tour took an unexpected turn , after a video from the concert went viral for all the wrong reasons. Instead of the upbeat atmosphere the singer is known to deliver, footage from the show has triggered widespread criticism online.

The man, identified as Aman, uploaded a short reel on Instagram, offering glimpses of his Singapore office while sharing his reflections. In the voiceover, he said: “India me leave maangne ke liye humein beg karna padta tha, sir tabiyat kharab hai, sir family emergency, we had to invent tragedy just to get a Friday leave. Here in Singapore I do not ask, I just inform. Shaam 6 baje baad mera phone mera hai, boss ka nahi, no calls, no guilt, just life. Agar tum 8 baje ke baad office me baith kar hard work kar rahe ho toh tum hard working nahi, tum bas exploited ho yaar.” According to him, simply notifying the team about time off—rather than pleading for approval—was one of the biggest behavioural shifts he experienced after relocating. In the caption accompanying the clip, Aman wrote: “The biggest mindset shift I had moving to Singapore. Stop justifying your time off. In toxic cultures, you feel the need to explain why you aren’t working. You overshare details hoping for sympathy or approval.” He noted that this change in approach helped him understand how different corporate environments shape an employee’s confidence, boundaries, and mental well-being. His commentary struck a chord with many Indian employees who often highlight similar concerns—strict leave policies, long hours, and a lingering expectation to stay reachable beyond work timings. The video renewed conversations about healthier work structures and the need for trust-based systems. The clip prompted a flood of responses. One commenter hoped \"GenZ's change this in India,\" while another said, \"I also want this kind of work culture.\" Others related strongly to his observations, with a user noting, \"As an Indian I completely relate with Indian toxic work culture,\" and another writing, \"You are doing your dream job,\" applauding his improve", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/india-singapore-work-culture-differences-revealed-by-a-singapore-based-indian-11765186414013.html", "timestamp": 1765193476.3255816}

Fireworks from the electric the triggered the fire after its sparks came in contact with the thatched bamboo roof and fibre sheets. An eyewitness in an interview with Hindustan Times said, “It started when a belly dance performance was underway. The performers used some cold pyro sticks which upon ignition leapt skywards and came in contact with the ceiling made of bamboo, fibre and straw-type material.

PM Modi was quick to respond. He said, “I will say Bankim Babu . Thank you, I respect your sentiments,” before joking, “Can I call you dada, or is that also an issue?” ‘Da’ is the short form of ‘dada’, meaning elder brother, used informally for someone older, familiar, or respected in a friendly way. Calling someone ‘Bankim Da’ feels friendly and familiar. ‘Babu’, on the other hand, is formal and respectful and historically used for educated, respected gentlemen. At times, it is referred to as a sarcastic reference to the colonial-era intellectual Bangalis who attempted to ‘adapt’ to British culture, earning the reputation of aspiring to the so-called Babu culture.

According to The Independent report, the news reporter was left with a bloody face after being struck by a seagull while filming. The journalist, a New Zealand -based reporter, Jessica Tyson, was reportedly filming an outdoor segment for the Maori+ show Te Ao with Moana when the bird slammed into her. The bird was possibly blown off course by the high winds. ”Oh my god, my eye,” Tyson winced, before quickly realising the collision had opened up a cut above her right eye. In a screenshot from her Instagram story , accessed by The Independent, the journalist could be seen bleeding from near her eye, sparking concerns about the extent of her injury. However, speaking to Channel 9’s Today programme, the journalist confirmed that although she was left with a scar, she wasn’t seriously injured. She also shared that she had continued filming after getting the injury cleaned up. Social media users were concerned about the journalist's injury and joked that the seagull should be “arrested” for the assault. “The bird chose violence,” a netizen quipped. Another said, “Left wing? Right wing? Whole fuckin bird mate.” A user joked, “Need to check what she was about to talk? Maybe it was the God message, to stop her to say some crap.” “Arrest the bird for assault,” another added. “Proof that my fear of flying living things is not unfounded!” said a netizen. “I have a work accident to report,” another netizen added.

Judge Honey M Varghese found Pulsar Suni and five others guilty of multiple offences under the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act, according to the Bar and Bench report. Those convicted are: Sunil NS (Pulsar Suni) Martin Antony Manikandan B Vijeesh VP Salim H (Vadival Salim) Pradeep The court held them guilty under IPC Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 340–354, 366, 354B, 376D (gang rape), and also under Section 66A of the IT Act. Sentencing will follow separately. The case pertains to the abduction and sexual assault of a prominent South Indian actress on 17 February 2017, when she was travelling to a film location in Thrissur. A group of men allegedly forced their way into her moving vehicle, assaulted her, and recorded videos of the attack. The next day, the vehicle’s driver, Martin Antony , was arrested. Within a week, police apprehended Pulsar Suni, a known history-sheeter, who became the first accused. Additional arrests followed through the month as the investigation widened. Suni remained in custody for more than seven years until the Supreme Court granted him bail last year. In July 2017, police arrested actor Dileep on charges of criminal conspiracy, purportedly to take revenge after the survivor informed his then-wife about an alleged extramarital affair. His early bail applications were rejected twice by the Kerala High Court. He eventually secured bail in October 2017 after spending 83 days in custody.

Trump was critical of Zelensky after US and Ukrainian negotiators completed three days of talks on Saturday aimed at trying to narrow differences on the US administration's proposal to end the Ukraine war. But in an exchange with reporters on Sunday night, Trump suggested that the Ukrainian leader is holding up the talks from moving forward. The US plan has been through several drafts since it first emerged last month, amid criticism it was too soft on Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Trump has had a hot-and-cold relationship with Zelensky since riding into a second White House term, insisting that the war was a waste of US taxpayer money. Trump also repeatedly urged the Ukrainians to cede land to Russia to bring an end to a now nearly four-year conflict he says has cost far too many lives. Zelensky said Saturday he had a “substantive phone call” with the American officials engaged in the talks with a Ukrainian delegation in Florida.

Tensions have simmered since Thailand last month suspended de-escalation measures after a Thai soldier was maimed in the latest in a succession of incidents involving landmines that Bangkok says were newly laid by Cambodia. Cambodia rejects the allegations. BUDGETS AND GROUND PERSONNEL Cambodia had a defence budget of $1.3 billion in 2024 and 124,300 active military personnel. The armed forces were established in 1993 from the merger of the country's former Communist military and two other resistance armies. Of this, the Cambodian army is the largest force, with some 75,000 soldiers, backed by more than 200 battle tanks and around 480 pieces of artillery. Thailand, which the U.S. classifies as a major non-NATO ally, has a large, well-funded military, with a defence budget of $5.73 billion in 2024 and over 360,000 active armed forces personnel. The Thai army has a total of 245,000 personnel, including an estimated 115,000 conscripts, around 400 battle tanks, over 1,200 armoured personnel carriers and some 2,600 artillery weapons. The army has its own fleet of aircraft, comprising passenger planes, helicopters such as dozens of U.S.-made Black Hawks, and unmanned aerial vehicles. AIR FORCES Cambodia's air force has 1,500 personnel, with a relatively small fleet of aircraft, including 10 transport planes and 10 transport helicopters. It doesn't possess any fighter aircraft but has 16 multi-role helicopters, including six Soviet-era Mi-17s and 10 Chinese Z-9s. Thailand has one of the best equipped and trained air forces in Southeast Asia, with an estimated 46,000 personnel, 112 combat capable aircraft, including 28 F-16s and 11 Swedish Gripen fighter jets, and dozens of helicopters.

This recent high-profile jewellery theft and the accidental water leak raise concerns over the museum’s infrastructure.", "content": "Paris' Louvre Museum is once again in the spotlight after the authorities recently announced that several hundred works from the Egyptian department were damaged due to a water leak late in November. The incident reportedly occurred on 26 November, almost a month after a daring jewellery heist in which Napoleonic jewellery worth $102 million was stolen in broad daylight. The museum’s deputy general manager, Francis Steinbock, elaborated on the extent of damage and informed that periodicals and archaeological reviews dating from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were damaged. As per The Guardian report, the water leak damaged between 300 and 400 works. Egyptologists and students regularly consulted these treasured works. Even though the damaged items were “extremely useful”, they were not “unique”, said Steinbock. Suggesting that the losses in these collections are not significant, Steinbock added, “At this stage, we have no irreparable and definitive losses in these collections.” “No heritage artefacts have been affected by this damage,\" The Guardian quoted the deputy administrator as saying. According to a Bloomberg report, the world's most visited museum suffered a leak from a water pipe that damaged treasured items kept in its library on Egyptian antiquities. In the Mollien wing, a valve from an obsolete heating and ventilation system accidentally opened, which caused water to seep through the ceiling. The system was shut off for several months and was due to be replaced in September 2026. Francis Steinbock said that restoration of damaged works is in progress, which will “be dried, sent to a bookbinder to be restored, and then returned to the shelves.” The concerned authorities launched an internal investigation into the leak. Notably, four suspects have been charged in the October jewel robbery, but the whereabouts of the precious jewellery— including royal necklaces, tiaras and earrings — are still unknown.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable.
