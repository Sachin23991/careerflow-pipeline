The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

His advice to aspirants: – Focus on strengths, avoid comparison, drink enough water, and sleep well. “CAT is not about knowing everything; it’s about knowing what you know well.” What to avoid: – No late-night study – No new topics – No scrolling through forums – Don’t freeze if the first few questions look tough “Don’t let someone else’s stress become yours.” How he attempted the paper: A quick scan, attempt the obvious ones, mark the rest, no over checking. “Move fast, trust yourself, don’t overthink.” Also Read | CAT 2025: Common mistakes aspirants make and how to avoid them Apoorva Rajadhyaksha , who scored a perfect 100 percentile i", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-what-toppers-did-in-the-last-few-days-before-test-mba-admission-iim-10384785/", "timestamp": 1764423103.041936}

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people.

The Ministry of Education had earlier this year set up a nine-member panel to examine issues relating to coaching and the emergence of “dummy schools” besides the effectiveness and fairness of entrance examinations. The panel is studying the effectiveness and fairness of competitive entrance examinations in the context of the school education system and their influence on the growth of the coaching industry. During the year, the parliamentary panel will also examine the “current practices and policies” regarding school closure.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

In addition, SSC has reinstated the ‘own scribe’ facility for persons with benchmark disabilities (PwBD), applicable to examinations notified on or before December 31, following clarifications issued by the DEPwD. The facility is now governed by additional compliance requirements. Under the revised norms, the age of the scribe must correspond to the qualification level of the examination. For matriculation and Class 12 examinations, the scribe should generally not be older than 20 years, while for graduate-level examinations, the age limit is 22 years. Moreover, Aadhaar-based authentication has been made mandatory for all scribes registered under the “Own Scribe” facility. In cases where Aadhaar verification cannot be completed at the examination venue, candidates will be required either to use a scribe provided by the Commission or to appear for the examination without one.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764423137.8012114}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.

The team’s celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball. “We went from zero to $30 million in revenue. We sold out games. We built something people didn’t think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an interview last month , pointing to Angel City’s commercial success from the very outset of the team’s formation. “That really led to the formation of Monarch.” That commercial success, not trophies, became the blueprint for Monarch Collective, the $250 million fund Nortman launched in 2023 , which has become the first investment vehicle focused exclusively on women’s sports. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch’s portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City’s training facility in Thousand Oaks, California.

But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market. “You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler , general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month. The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld , vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added. Marc Manara , head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it. “There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.” Specifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past.

And the fight that’s brewing isn’t about the technology, it’s about who gets to do the regulating. In the absence of a meaningful federal AI standard that focuses on consumer safety, states have introduced dozens of bills to protect residents against AI-related harms, including California’s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act, which prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems. The tech giants and buzzy startups born out of Silicon Valley argue such laws create an unworkable patchwork that threatens innovation. “It’s going to slow us in the race against China,” Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, told TechCrunch. The industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all. In the trenches of that all-or-nothing battle, new efforts have emerged to prohibit states from enacting their own AI legislation. House lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI. A sweeping preemption that would take away states’ rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year. Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight. To create that national standard, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk. A megabill such as this will likely take months, if not years, to become law, underscoring why the current rush to li", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/", "timestamp": 1764423289.1189542}

Although the iPad started off as a device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into computers that can handle a variety of different tasks for personal, work, and school use. As a result, there are numerous apps to help you do things like create a single place to organize your life or help you stay focused on your day-to-day tasks by blocking out distractions. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best ones that are available on the App Store. Goodnotes is one of the most popular iPad apps , and for good reason. The app is great for people who like to write out notes using an Apple Pencil ; you can include both handwritten and typed text on one page and add things like images, stickers, and even doodles. You can create a digital notebook with blank or ruled paper for notes, checklists, planners, and more. The app lets you export entire digital notebooks or specific pages into PDFs and other files. Goodnotes is also great for drawing and sketching. While it’s not as advanced as some creativity apps like Procreate, Goodnotes is easy to use and perfect for quick sketches or diagrams. If you’re attending a class or a meeting, you can also record audio notes that are synced to the moment you write. Plus, you can use AI to summarize your notes and help you write. You can create three digital notebooks for free. If you want unlimited notebooks, you’ll have to pay $9.99 per year or a one-time fee of $29.99.

Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.) As for all that customer demand, Burry has basically proposed it’s a mirage because AI cu", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/27/this-thanksgivings-real-drama-may-be-michael-burry-versus-nvidia/", "timestamp": 1764423289.5982046}

The list will instead focus on somewhat lesser-known apps. Procreate is one of the most popular drawing apps for the iPad, and for good reason. The app lets you create digital paintings, sketches, and illustrations using dozens of different types of brushes. Procreate is easy to use and features built-in gesture controls, along with a simple interface. The app allows for high-resolution canvases up to 16K by 8K on compatible iPad Pros. It also lets you create storyboards, GIFs, animatics, and simple animations. Plus, you can import image files such as JPG, PNG, and TIFF. Procreate includes several features that are designed to help you during the creative process on your iPad, such as QuickShape, StreamLine, Drawing Assist, and ColorDrop.

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever. In this interview, Damoa is fresh off this big win and eager to use the momentum and prize money to accelerate Glīd into their next phase.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained.

OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT.

Kensington’s website said the cause of the cyberattack is “now established,” but the council “will not be giving out further details of the incident at this stage” due to an ongoing investigation with U.K. law enforcement agencies.

Baris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, is leaving the company effective December 12, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. CNBC was the first to report the departure. Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google. The departures come several months after GM hired Sterling Anderson to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson’s role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM. Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. The departures are part of a restructuring within GM that’s supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company’s cars, trucks, and SUVs. Instead of separate teams, each with overlapping roles, the plan is to integrate hardware and software engineering, AI capabilities, and global product into one organization, according to a series of statements covering each executive’s departure. As Anderson reshapes the organization, he is also bringing in new talent.

In fact, in recent years, some of the most high-profile and brazen digital attacks around the world have been carried out by teens. But even if you're not a hacker, you’re probably still a prolific user of digital tools and social platforms. And whether you've never given much thought to your digital privacy and security or you've started to rein in your data, you can use this guide to implement basic precautions and keep operations security in mind. In other words, this guide contains advice and ideas to help you conceptualize how people can find out information about you from your digital activities—and start to minimize what’s out there in ways you didn’t intend. Protecting your digital privacy isn't a blanket prescription. Some people are more private by nature, and others prioritize putting themselves out there. But even if you're a 24/7 streamer, you can still think about your operations security, commonly known as opsec. What can viewers see in your room while you're streaming? Which people from your life have appeared onscreen? Could viewers figure out where you live from what they can see out your window? These same types of questions can be adapted for any type of onlooker—from the tech companies that operate the platforms you use to people browsing your social media or dating profiles or a friend (FORMER FRIEND) looking over your shoulder at your phone. In digital operations security, “operations” are the things that make up online activity like messages, searches, AI chats, websites, photos, accounts, passwords, and so on. The “security” piece has two goals. One is secrecy: No one sees stuff they shouldn’t. The other is availability: You don’t lose access to your data and accounts. Opsec is hard, because secrecy and availability conflict. The more secret you make things, the easier it is to accidentally lock yourself out and vice versa. Good security is a balance.

Some even let you write colored notes on the pages or in the digital notebook built within it. It makes for a really fun experience, especially if you're a book-annotator type of person (I aspire to be such a person, but I usually lose steam halfway through a good book) or love graphic novels. I've tried several color e-readers and e-paper devices in my testing , and as I compare overall features and value, I've found myself impressed again and again with the value of Kobo's color e-readers. Whether that's the larger Kobo Libra Colour, our favorite all-around e-reader that can double as a digital notebook, or the affordable Kobo Clara Colour, you can't go wrong with Kobo's colorful devices. From a simple glance, most color e-readers look pretty similar. You'll usually see a 150 pixels-per-inch resolution for color and 300 for black-and-white, which are specs we see for both Kobo’s and Kindle’s color devices. Kobo's two color e-readers, the Kobo Libra Colour and the Kobo Clara Colour, use E Ink Kaleido 3 technology to power their colorful screens. This technology has 16 levels of grayscale and 4,096 colors, allowing it to represent hues from your favorite books with ease. You'll see higher resolution for the black-and-white technology, since that's still the main base that color e-readers use; the lower-resolution colors are essentially a top-layer effect. So even though the color is lower resolution, you shouldn't notice a lower resolution overall.

That's where “Find my phone” capability comes in handy. Just ask a nearby family member or friend to use the feature built into their phone’s OS to ping the lost device, and it makes a loud noise that helps you find it. The problem: not everyone uses the same phone operating system. In my house, I have an iPhone and my wife has an Android . This means when I inevitably leave my phone in a hotel couch, she can't really help me find it. Sure, she could call my phone number, but I usually have my ringer off and Do Not Disturb enabled. (I'm annoying like that.) She obviously can't use Apple’s Find My iPhone, which doesn’t run on her Android device. And while both Apple and Google offer tools to see the location of paired devices from a computer, the computer that's nearby may not be set up with the proper permissions. Am I doomed to keep track of where my phone is, like a functional adult? No, thanks to a simple app called RingIt by Belgian developer Gaëtan Van Den Berge . This application, which is free for both Android and iOS, exists to make it easier for Android users to help iPhone users find their phone, and vice-versa. Just open the app, hit a button, and the other person's phone will ring—loudly—helping them to find their phone. \"The idea for RingIt actually came to me on vacation with my girlfriend,\" Van Den Berge tells me. \"I kept misplacing my phone, often while it was on silent, and I’d repeatedly ask her, 'Do you know where my phone is?' I remember thinking how nice it would be if she could just make my phone ring loudly from her own device, even if mine was muted.\" And so he made an application that does exactly this, and nothing else. The application doesn't collect location or any user data—just email addresses that are used for verification. Setting up the application is easy: just install the app on your phone.

As a deeper understanding of the human anatomy has come to light, vibrators are designed to transcend archaic stereotypes about what sexual pleasure should be. Vibrators today come in all shapes and sizes. Some look more like art than something that makes you go weak in the knees. What’s most important remains: These are sex toys that use internal motors to stimulate erogenous zones. Yes, zones plural; vibrators aren't just for vulvas. Phalluses and nipples also respond well to stimulation with the right rumbly sensations, as do the perineum, the insides of the thighs, and even the lower abdomen and nape of the neck.

I sometimes look forward to tomorrow's coffee long before I go to bed. And the Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the coffee machine that will get you thinking this way. The Aiden was last year's blockbuster coffee maker and still WIRED's favorite drip coffee machine overall. It is a cross between minimalist design and maximalist function, easy to use but able to be customized out the wazoo. And like a lot of last year's blockbuster devices, it's finally on a big sale: $80 off. It is a truly morning-changing machine, whether your choice is drip or pour-over or cold brew.

This is last season's robot vacuum, and it's at a better price while still packing plenty of features we like to see. Shopping for an older model is WIRED reviewer Adrienne So's advice to get a good robot vacuum without paying four figures. The X10 Pro Omni's mop has downward pressure to actually scrub floors, and it packs a self-emptying bin and a good camera navigation system. 3i Amazon If you're looking for more of a deal, our favorite basic and affordable vacuum is even cheaper than usual right now. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So was impressed by the offerings of this little robot. Especially the enormous 1-liter dustbin, since the vacuum doesn't have a docking station to empty into.

But underneath all that novelty is a hive of engineering and invention. Ninja often manages to take devices once reserved for professional kitchens and make them accessible to the broader public. But as with all novel things, mileage can vary. Here are deals on Ninja devices that the WIRED team has tested, loves, and can vouch for heartily. Ninja Amazon Ninja Ninja came out of the gate strong with its first line of semiautomatic, grinder-inclusive espresso machines designed for people who want both ease of use and the rich crema and intense, take-you-for-a-ride taste of actual espresso made with a non-pressurized portafilter. The Luxe Cafe Pro is Ninja's answer to Breville's wildly popular semi-automatic Barista Express ( also on sale for a terrific $500 price for Black Friday ). The Express has the edge on tried-and-tested durability. But Ninja's milk frother, with a whisk in its carafe, is better than any automatic milk frothing I've used from Breville—and the bean assist to help you dial in grinder settings is as good as anything I've seen in the price range. A cold foam option is also best-in-class. If you're an espresso purist, I'd roll with Breville. But milk lovers may have reason to choose Ninja. Ninja Amazon Walmart The Premier lacks the Pro model's hot water spout for Americanos, but still offers that bean assist and great milk frothing at a lower price. Ninja Amazon Ninja This nifty device can use both K-Cups and ground drip coffee. The latter is not as tasty as our top drip machines , but versatility is nice. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel I can't help it; I love cold, boozy, slushy drinks. I have liked them for many years.

Ritual Ritual Amazon Ritual’s Essential Protein Daily Shake is our top recommendation for women’s protein powder . It’s generally pricier than its competitors, but a $15 discount makes the cost more digestible. Its pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, and each serving also contains four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Ritual is a great supplement for sensitive stomachs as it’s free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial sweeteners. It’s also soy-free, gluten-free, and vegan. Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. It’s obviously made for protein shakes, but I personally prefer using this supplement in baked goods. Liquid I.V.

It's cute as a button, with clean and simple lines and an aesthetically pleasing design that should match any kitchen decor. I like the large touchscreen interface and the built-in wastebasket. My favorite part, though, is that the proprietary B-Pods are biodegradable and designed to break down in a landfill. I don't have to worry about specialty recycling or sending the pods off somewhere to be processed. And yes, the resulting beverage is good, too, be it coffee, tea, or “espresso.” (Sale price with coupon.) Ninja Amazon Ninja Sometimes a pod will do, and sometimes you want a whole pot of coffee. Rather than sacrifice double the counter space, consider the Ninja DualBrew Pro. This pod coffee maker can be used with K-Cups or coffee grounds that you supply, and in addition to brewing individual cups of coffee, you can also make entire carafes. There's a built-in milk frother , though you'll need to warm the milk separately, and you can also brew directly over ice if you prefer your coffee cold.

Do You Need a New Camera? Probably not. Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more. Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

If your bedsheets have seen better days, or you’re still rocking pajamas with questionably large holes in them, it’s probably wise to swap in a new set for regular use—salute to those products for holding out this long. Cozy Earth products have garnered a lot of hype for a reason, as they exude quality and luxury and are soft as heck.

Updated November 28: We've mentioned Branch's daily doorbuster deal and vetted prices. Branch Branch Amazon The Container Store This is my top recommendation for most people in my Best Office Chairs guide . There are dozens of cheaper chairs on the market, but it's hard to find an option under $500 that's comfortable and highly adjustable while also being attractive and offering various style options (Branch now even offers it with bouclé upholstery). The headrest is optional—I don't think you need it—but you can adjust the seat depth, the lumbar support can be aligned and pushed inward, and you can tilt the seat forward, too. Branch Branch Amazon On a tight budget? You won't find a better chair at this $300 mark. The Ergonomic Chair has many of the same adjustment points as the Pro, including seat depth, and has a similar design.

There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle. I mean, c’mon! But this is impressive: Around 240 BC, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt, came up with a brilliant way to calculate the radius of the spherical Earth. You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ). Using basic geometry, this meant the two cities were θ degrees apart on Earth’s 360-degree circumference. At this point, all he needed was the distance between the two cities—the arc length—which I’ll call s . Maybe he hired someone to pace it off, but in any case he got a distance o", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-measure-the-earths-radius-with-legos/", "timestamp": 1764423305.3632212}

Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved.

And we're getting more and more burnt out every year, because all of the promotion relies on us.” To fix that, Barey built Hidden around discoverability. “Innovation like adding a ForYou page makes it easier for girls to build up promo. It creates an ecosystem where we're all bringing fans that are circulating to everybody,” which helps girls who don’t have large followings, she says.

The Arlo Pro 5S, on sale for $85 (down from $180) , isn’t just a good security camera; it’s my pick of the best outdoor security cameras you can buy right now. The Arlo Pro 5S ticks every box, with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and a direct Wi-Fi connection. It is battery-powered, so there’s no need to run cables, offers two-way audio and a siren to scare intruders, and reliably detects people and notifies you. Want more deals? Read our Absolute Best Black Friday Deals roundup and our Black Friday liveblog to find the best bargains this sale weekend. Arlo Amazon Best Buy Video quality is obviously paramount for a security camera, and Arlo’s Pro 5S records at up to 2K resolution. The inclusion of HDR ensures your video doesn’t look blown out when there's a light source in frame. The wide 160-degree field of view takes in the whole scene. When darkness falls, you have a choice of color night vision or a motion-activated spotlight. Best Black Friday Tech Deals (2025) Explore the story One of the main reasons I like the Arlo Pro 5S so much is the swift-loading Arlo app. It delivers rich notifications, showing a few frames with the subject highlighted right there in the notification on your phone or smartwatch. It also supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. You can filter motion alerts by people, animals, vehicles, and packages, and the camera is pretty accurate at correctly identifying subjects. You can also set up privacy zones very easily in the app. The wide smart home support makes it easy to call up your camera feed on your preferred smart displays . The big catch with Arlo systems is that you need an Arlo Secure plan ($10 per month or $96 a year for a single camera, $20 per month or $216 a year for unlimited cameras) to access the best features, bu", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/arlo-pro-5s-black-friday-deal-2025/", "timestamp": 1764423309.6378026}

If you've been thinking of updating, now is the time to buy. The A7R V isn't our top-pick mirrorless camera, but that's mainly because at full price it's expensive relative to the rest of the market. At this price, though, it's a steal, maybe even one of the absolute best Black Friday deals , and while there is no truly best camera for everyone, the A7R V is unquestionably the highest-resolution camera you can buy. And I know, megapixels aren't everything, but I have never taken an image with this camera and thought, darn, that's just too many megapixels. Sony Amazon Adorama B&H Photo The massive 61-megapixel, full-frame sensor in the A7R V is the largest sensor you can get without moving up to a bigger, bulkier medium-format camera. If you want to go totally nuts, get this, landscape photographers: The A7R V can combine 16 shots into a single 240-MP image. It only works with static subjects, but if you ever worried if your images are hi-res enough to cover the side of a building in Times Square, well, you can rest easy with the A7R V. Best Black Friday Tech Deals (2025) Explore the story Yes, the megapixel race is silly and mostly over, but I will say that I've shot quite a bit with the A7R C—which uses the same sensor—and images from this 60-MP sensor are noticeable sharper, and the dynamic range is visibly better than what I get from the A7R II (which has a 40-MP sensor). This is obviously the case onscreen, when pixel peeping, but I also notice the difference when I print images. That the A7R V is $900 off does make you wonder if perhaps the A7R VI is on the horizon? Anything is possible, but I kind of doubt it's coming imminently. The A7C R, which as noted above, is nearly identical in features, is still not on sale.

After all, Kohler is big—one of the biggest family-owned manufacturing empires in the country. And the stuff it sells is big. And so Kohler's Black Friday sale likewise thinks big, offering discounts on life-changing bathroom and kitchen installations.

Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars. Best Black Friday Home and Beauty Deals (2025) Explore the story Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough) . But then a decade later, Kohler quite literally invented the American bathtub—a clawfoot design still popular today among those with a yen for nostalgia. By the 1910s, according to their company history, Kohler also inaugurated the “integrated-apron” bathtub that's in more common use today. So Kohler knows how to make a bathtub, is what we're saying—including a wide variety of hydrotherapy models—and handsome shower fixtures. Modern bathroom collections from Kohler include decor sets designed by lifestyle influencers like Jenn Lake or Jenni Yolo , as well as some people who are not named Jennifer. But around the WIRED Reviews team, Kohler is mostly considered heroic because they make WIRED's favorite bidet priced for mere mortals.

This leads to overeating unhealthy snacks or heavy dinners, ultimately causing weight gain instead of loss. Carb-heavy lunches like plain rice, noodles, or parathas spike blood sugar, creating energy crashes and cravings soon after eating. Without protein for balance, the body stores more fat and feels hungry quickly again. Restaurant meals often contain excess oil, salt, sauces, and hidden sugars even in seemingly healthy options. Regular consumption increases calorie intake without nutritional value, promoting weight gain and water retention. Sugary beverages like cold coffee, packaged juices, soda, and sweetened tea add unnecessary calories and sugar spikes. They don’t keep you full, pushing the body to store extra calories as belly fat. Eating in a rush prevents the brain from registering fullness, causing overeating before satisfaction kicks in. Quick eating also affects digestion and increases cravings later, contributing to unhealthy weight gain. Larger plates, lunch buffets, and habitual overeating lead to consuming more calories than the body needs. Extra food gets stored as fat, even if the meal is healthy. Portion awareness supports weight control. Many packaged “health foods” like granola bars, flavored yogurt, and ready-to-eat bowls contain hidden sugar, preservatives, and refined carbs. They cause energy crashes and weight gain, unlike whole nutritious homemade foods.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The ceremony, anticipated by fans, the entertainment industry and sections of the cricketing community, did not go ahead as scheduled. Both families released a brief clarification stating that the event had been postponed owing to health reasons, offering no further explanation. The lack of clarity fuelled widespread online speculation, with social-media users suggesting that the reasons may run deeper than what was officially conveyed. Against this backdrop of conjecture, scrutiny and misinformation, both Mandhana and Muchhal appeared to make a deliberate, unified move online. At nearly the same time, the pair updated their Instagram bios, adding just a single symbol — the nazar (evil-eye) emoji . There was no statement, no comment, and no attempt to address the rumours directly. Instead, the symbol — traditionally used across South Asia to ward off negativity and ill will — became the couple’s first visible joint act since discussions around their postponed wedding began dominating online conversations. The alarm bells first rang when Mandhana deleted every post related to the wedding — including her proposal video and engagement announcement — from her Instagram . Meanwhile, the same items remained on Muchhal’s profile. The situation escalated into controversy when an Instagram user, Mary D’Costa, published what she described as screenshots of chat exchanges from earlier this year.

However, Central Province’s Kandy relief officials said the death toll could be much higher as the toll in the Kandy district itself had reached more than 50 by late Friday night and remained unverified officially. Badulla in the central hills is another district badly hit by landslides with many people missing and over 35 dead. The flooding situation in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for those living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows into the Indian Ocean from Colombo. The Kelani burst its banks on Friday evening, forcing hundreds of people to move to temporary shelters, the DMC said. Rains have subsided in most parts of the island country, including the capital, but parts of the island's north were experiencing showers due to the residual effects of Cyclone Ditwah . The weather system is moving away from the island towards neighbouring India, the DMC said. The weather bureau said more rains over 200 mm were expected to fall, although Ditwah may exit the island by late Saturday. Sri Lanka is facing one of its worst disasters as cyclonic storm Ditwah wreaked havoc, causing floods and landslides that left a trail of destruction and damage to infrastructure. Cyclone Ditwah is expected to make landfall between north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh between the evening of November 29 and the morning of November 30.

What further drew the ED’s attention was that more than ₹ 1 crore, out of the over ₹ 331 crore deposited, had been used to cover expenses for a \"grand destination wedding\" at a luxury hotel in Udaipur, Rajasthan. Officials said the wedding is linked to a young politician from Gujarat, who may soon be summoned for questioning. The ED believes that the driver’s bank account was a \"mule\" platform. Investigators quickly realised it was a typical case of a “mule” account being used to channel illicit funds. A mule account is used to funnel illicit funds generated from financial crimes, and the actual owner is not its user. Such accounts are created using fake or hired KYC, where someone lends their account in exchange for a commission. Officials informed PTI that the ED came across the driver of the ride-hailing platform during their investigation into the 1xbet online betting -related money-laundering case. Officials stated that the driver's bank account received deposits totaling ₹ 331.36 crore between August 19, 2024, and April 16, 2025. Alarmed by the \"suspicious\" multi-crore-rupee transactions within just eight months, the federal agency conducted a raid at the address listed in the driver's bank records. Investigators discovered that the driver lived in a two-room shanty in a modest Delhi neighbourhood and spent his entire day on the road, driving his bike to make a living. The driver reportedly told ED investigators during questioning that he had no knowledge of the bank transactions and could not identify the bride, groom, or their families, whose Udaipur wedding was \"funded\" through his account.

Shared by user Imsongoku7, the anecdotal account highlights the stark contrast many Indians feel when coming back home after a trip abroad — especially when it comes to civic behaviour, infrastructure and everyday interactions. The user wrote that he had just returned from an 8–9 day foreign trip and was still enjoying the memory of clean roads, organised traffic and basic civic discipline he experienced overseas. The moment he landed in Mumbai and took a connecting flight to Nagpur, he sensed the shift. He first encountered an inflated fare: “One guy near the stand asked ₹ 500 just to drop me till Lokmat Square. I just stared and said, ‘Bro, I’m also from here.’” He then booked an Ola and reached Lokmat Square — only to notice the auto driver chewing gutka and spitting repeatedly on the road. But the worst was yet to come. While walking with a heavy bag on an uneven footpath, he sprained his ankle. Moments later, an auto driver driving past spat gutka that landed directly on his shoe. “That was it. Full ‘welcome back to reality’ moment. Within one hour — scam attempt, gutka spitting, sprain, and gutka on shoe.” He summed up the experience with a tone of resigned humour: “Not even angry at this point, just laughing at how brutally fast the transition was.” The post quickly went viral, with many users agreeing that coming back to India can be a jarring switch — particularly with public hygiene, road safety and traffic discipline. Several comments echoed similar frustrations: “Make peace with it. its not worth the effort to burn your energy thinking about it or trying to change. just make sure your own behaviour is upto your standards. you cant change lame ass people, they deserve what they get,” a user advised. “There is one thing being optimistic and one thing being blindly optimistic, whatever happens doesn't make us go up.

Their pre-wedding celebrations had already lit up social media, with fans eagerly waiting for glimpses from the big day. But celebrations quickly turned into concern. Reports surfaced on Sunday morning that Smriti’s father, Srinivas Mandhana, had been hospitalised due to a heart issue. Soon after, Palash too was admitted with viral symptoms and acidity complications. His sister, singer Palak Muchhal , later confirmed that the wedding ceremonies had been postponed until both families were in better health. Thankfully, both Smriti’s father and Palash have since been discharged. Adding to speculation, Smriti deleted her proposal and engagement posts — content that had earlier taken the internet by storm — while her close friends Jemimah Rodrigues and Shreyanka Patil also removed celebratory posts. Both Smriti and Palash have now added a nazar emoji to their Instagram bios — a symbol believed to ward off negative energy. While fans await clarity on the new wedding date, here’s a look back at how their relationship blossomed: The two reportedly began dating in 2019 — a relationship kept largely away from the public eye. Despite coming from different creative fields, they connected over ambition, discipline and a strong work ethic. After years of subtle mentions and rare appearances in each other’s social media posts, the couple finally made it Instagram official in July 2024, celebrating five years together with a heartfelt message.  Following India’s Women’s World Cup triumph, Palash revealed a tattoo on his hand — featuring Smriti’s initials and her jersey number — calling it his tribute to her success. In a moment scripted like cinema, Palash proposed to Smriti at DY Patil Stadium, the iconic venue where she lifted the World Cup trophy.

In the short clip, Dayal narrates an incident just three days after quitting his job and returning to his family home from another city. He recalls how things felt different when he was earning — a time when he felt valued for his contribution. Something as simple as his mother offering him extra rotis at dinner made him feel appreciated, he says.

Approximately 200 to 250 planes in India may need software updates.", "content": "Several domestic airlines may experience delays and schedule changes on Saturday across multiple routes due to a technical directive from Airbus affecting its A320 fleet. Many airlines warned of delays and cancellations following an alert from Airbus, which suggested that up to 6,000 active A320 aircraft might require upgrades. IndiGo, Air India, and others are expected to experience operational disruptions. The airline informed its passengers that it is updating its aircraft, which may result in slight schedule changes for some flights and encouraged them to check their flight status online. In a post on the social media platform X, IndiGo said, “Airbus has issued a technical advisory for the global A320 fleet. We are proactively completing the mandated updates on our aircraft with full diligence and care, in line with all safety protocols. While we work through these precautionary updates, some flights may see some slight schedule changes. Our teams are here 24×7 to support you with rebooking, updates, and information. Please check your latest flight status on our app/website before heading to the airport.”  Air India acknowledged a directive from Airbus for the A320 aircraft, leading to longer turnaround times and operational delays. Passengers have been advised to check flight status online and contact the airline for assistance during this period. “We are aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in-service across airline operators.

In a letter dated 28 November, it directed West Bengal's top law enforcement officials to ensure safety and security of Booth Level Officers (BLOs), the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) and other poll officials involved in the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise across the state. Urging concerned authorities to make robust security measures to prevent any intimidation of election personnel, the letter said, “The Commission is concerned about the safety and security of the Booth Level Officers and other field functionaries engaged in SIR work and therefore directs that all possible measures shall be taken by the police authorities to ensure safety and security of these officers and staff.\" It further added, \"It shall be ensured that there is no perceptible atmosphere of fear, threat and undue influence on these field functionaries and that no untoward incident occurs at any place.” The call for enhanced security measures comes after 24 November security breach at the central Kolkata building where protesters opposed the SIR exercise. Emphasising that BLOs must not be subjected to pressure, threats or interference from political party workers, the letter states, \"In exercise of the powers conferred on it by Article 324 (6) of the Constitution of India, the Election Commission of India hereby appoints you as its Special Roll Observer in connection with work relating to Special Intensive Revision of Electoral Rolls in the State of West Bengal.

Both were shot in an ambush attack, with Trump confirming that one of them had died. CBS News footage showed the two soldiers lying motionless on the ground, surrounded by numerous law enforcement officers, including police and Secret Service agents, amid the chaos. A nearby bus stop was also struck during the ambush-style attack, scattering shards of glass across the area. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, succumbed to her injuries on Thanksgiving, while Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained hospitalised and fighting for his life as of Friday evening. Beckstrom, a native of Webster Springs, W.Va., was remembered by her loved ones on Friday as the “sweetest girl” with a “heart of gold\". Fellow West Virginia native Wolfe, from Martinsville, remained in critical condition on Friday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey stated. The two service members were in Washington, DC, as part of President Trump’s deployment of troops to cities facing increasing crime. Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal was injured after another National Guard member returned fire, stopping his violent attack. Lakanwal arrived in the US with his family in 2021 after fleeing his war-torn Middle Eastern homeland, where he had served in an elite unit with connections to the CIA. Federal prosecutors stated that he is facing first-degree murder and related charges, the New York Post report noted. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced plans to pursue the death penalty against him. Flags across the state are being flown at half-staff to honour Beckstrom’s memory.  Jeanine Pirro, US attorney for Washington , DC, stated that additional charges are expected against 29-year-old Lakanwal, who migrated from Afghanistan in 2021 under “Operation Allies Welcome” foll", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/white-house-shooting-haunting-image-shows-national-guard-members-motionless-after-afghan-national-suspect-shot-down-11764379421398.html", "timestamp": 1764423393.3899076}

Despite expected heavy footfall in stores, cautious spending prevailed due to inflation and other factors.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "US shoppers spent $8.6 billion online this Black Friday, according to a report by Adobe Analytics, as more consumers opted to scroll for deals on their phones and laptops over standing in the cold to chase deals during the crucial holiday shopping weekend. Online spending grew 9.4% through 6:30 pm ET (1130 GMT) on Black Friday compared with the previous year, according to Adobe Inc's data and insights arm, which vets e-commerce transactions, covering more than 1 trillion visits to retail sites in the United States. Stores were expected to draw heavy footfall, but post- Thanksgiving bargain hunting remained muted as shoppers grew cautious of overspending amid persistent inflation, trade policy-driven uncertainty, and a weakening labor market, Reuters reported. While early online sales signaled strong momentum, most Black Friday shopping at major retailers has happened between 10 am and 2 pm ET (1900 GMT) on Friday, according to data from Adobe Analytics, with another surge expected later in the evening. However, the data firm anticipates shoppers to spend anywhere between $11.7 billion and $11.9 billion on Friday, following a final tally, saying it could set a new record for online sales on Black Friday. It expects consumers to spend  $5.5 billion  on Saturday $5.9 billion  on Sunday, both higher than last year as discounts remain elevated. Black Friday spending has remained strong, thanks to deeper-than-expected discounts, Adobe said. The rise of online shopping has also diluted the day's traditional significance, with promotions now stretched over several weeks. Adobe Analytics expects Cyber Monday to generate $14.2 billion in online sales, a 6.3% increase from last year, making it the biggest online shopping day of the year.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop.
