The Bench directed that all appointment or promotion orders issued under the Act must explicitly state that they are provisional and contingent on the court’s final judgment, preventing candidates from claiming equity if the enhanced quotas are struck down.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season.

In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

This is the time when most students are juggling multiple demands—revision, full-length syllabus coverage, coaching classes, test series, and the pressure to meet their own expectations. As the exam inches closer, it is natural to experience stress and a sense of urgency to perform well. Amidst all this, aspirants often look for methods that can make their preparation more effective, structured, and result-oriented. Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test. But simply taking a mock test is not enough. The real value lies in taking each mock seriously, approaching it with exam-like discipline, analysing the results with patience and depth, and learning something meaningful from every attempt. Read More | How to balance JEE Main 2026 & Class 12th board exam preparation When mock tests are used thoughtfully and consistently, they help in developing a mental discipline, sharpening cognitive ability, improving precision, and building the confidence needed to face the actual JEE Main exam .

Before taking mock tests regularly, the first and most important step is to ensure that you choose the right mock tests.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025.

From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said.

Here are the educational qualifications of the Bihar Cabinet top Ministers 2025 Nitish Kumar began his early education in local schools in Bakhtiyarpur. In 1972, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Bihar Engineering College, now known as NIT Patna. During his college years, he participated in technical clubs and projects. After earning his engineering degree, Nitish Kumar began his career at the Bihar State Electricity Board, but his growing interest in social issues and public life soon drew him away from engineering, and he chose politics. The National Institute of Technology Patna, established on January 28, 2004, became the 18th NIT in India after the Ministry of Human Resource Development rechristened the historic Bihar College of Engineering. Its roots stretch back to 1886, when the Pleaders’ Survey Training School was founded in Patna.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

Around 57 per cent of these institutions reported a decrease in new international student enrolments for the 2025-26 academic year, while 14 per cent reported stable numbers, and 29 per cent indicated an increase.

The fall semester began in August/September this year. “For India, the top sender of international students whose numbers soared post-pandemic, the majority of institutions now report new enrolment declines, with only 39 per cent of institutions noting increased or stable numbers. These declines in new enrollment from India are likely driving the overall national declines in new enrollment,” the report on the fall 2025 session noted. In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals. While 96 per cent of institutions cited the visa application process as a factor in the decline of new international student enrolment this year, this figure was only 64 per cent in the fall of 2021, and was at 85 per cent last year. The fall snapshot was released along with the Open Doors 2025 report Monday, which shows that new international student enrolment in 2024", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/international-student-enrolments-in-us-universities-dropp-2025-26-iie-10369929/", "timestamp": 1764680345.8859448}

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As part of the expansion, the Indian telecom ministry is requiring companies that buy or trade used phones to verify every device through a central database of IMEI numbers. This comes in addition to a recent directive ordering smartphone manufacturers to preinstall the government’s Sanchar Saathi app on all new handsets and push it onto existing devices through a software update. Reuters first reported the news on Monday, which was later confirmed by the ministry in a public statement. Launched in 2023 , the Sanchar Saathi portal allows users to block or trace lost and stolen phones. The system has blocked more than 4.2 million devices and traced 2.6 million more devices, per government data. The system expanded earlier this year with the release of a dedicated Sanchar Saathi app in January, which the government says helped recover more than 700,000 phones, including 50,000 in October alone. The Sanchar Saathi app has since gained broad adoption. The app has been downloaded nearly 15 million times and saw more than three million monthly active users in November — up more than 600% from its launch month, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Web traffic to Sanchar Saathi has also surged, with monthly unique visitors rising by more than 49% year-over-year, per Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch. The government’s order to pre-install Sanchar Saathi has already drawn significant backlash from privacy advocates, civil society groups, and opposition parties.

The round was led by FirstMark Capital and Eurazeo, with participation from Niel, DST Global Partners, billionaire Eric Schmidt and other investors. Gradium has developed audio language AI models designed to deliver voice at scale with ultra-low latency — essentially, AI voices that respond almost instantly. It was founded just a few months ago, in September, 2025, by Kyutai founding member Neil Zeghidour, who cut his teeth working with voice models as a researcher at Google DeepMind. The startup’s goal, it says, is to make voice models speedier and more accurate for developers. And, as a European startup, it launched with multilingual support out of the gate: English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, with additional languages coming. Of course, Gradium is entering a race with plenty of competition. For starters, the frontier LLM companies like OpenAI, Anthropic , Meta Llma , and Mistral all have voice, speech recognition, and multimodal models. Then there are well-funded startups like ElevenLabs , and hundreds of voice/speech models on Hugging Face. Right now, there’s no shortage of options for a developer needing AI voice capabilities. That said, the need for what Gradium hopes to offer — ultra-realistic voice expression and accuracy — will only grow over time, as AI moves from typed chats to AI agents and expands into use cases from entertainment to work.

At TechCrunch’s signature Disrupt event back in October, Sequoia Capital’s Roelof Botha jokingly offered what might be the understatement of the year when asked about the trend: “[Some] of the most dangerous words in the world are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” Other VCs have similarly expressed concerns, if quietly, about what it means when their portfolio companies are suddenly competing against startups backed by the U.S. Treasury, or even when they find themselves sitting across the table from government representatives at board meetings.

He’ll stick around through spring as an adviser. His replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It’s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately. The move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed. Its first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC complained twice after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn’t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final even began . Then there was Siri’s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple. A Bloomberg investigation published in May revealed the depths of Apple’s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple’s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn’t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who’d been promised an AI-powered assistant. By that point, Giannandrea had already been sidelined, according to Bloomberg. The news organization reported that Tim Cook had stripped Siri from Giannandrea’s oversight entirely back in March, handing it to Vision Pro cr", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/apple-just-named-a-new-ai-chief-with-google-and-microsoft-expertise-as-john-giannandrea-steps-down/", "timestamp": 1764680626.1092498}

The promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service. In a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.” Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard . More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail , Calendar and Drive. But as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history , and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations.

Just over a year after adding climate risk scores, Zillow has removed them from more than 1 million listings after real estate agents complained that the information was causing them to lose sales. Zillow first added the data to the site in September 2024, saying that more than 80% of buyers consider climate risks when purchasing a new home. But last month, following objections from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS), Zillow removed the listings’ climate scores. In their place is a subtle link to their records at First Street, the climate risk analytic startup that provides the data. “When buyers lack access to clear climate-risk information, they make the biggest financial decision of their lives while flying blind,” First Street spokesperson Matthew Eby told TechCrunch via email. “The risk doesn’t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability.” First Street’s climate risk scores first appeared on Realtor.com in 2020, where they remain. They  also still appear on Redfin and and Homes.com. The New York-based startup has raised more than $50 million from investors including General Catalyst, Congruent Ventures, and Galvanize Climate Solutions, according to PitchBook. Art Carter, the CRMLS CEO, told The New York Times that “displaying the probability of a specific home flooding this year or within the next five years can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability of that property.” He also questioned the accuracy of First Street’s data, saying he didn’t think that areas which haven’t flooded in the last 40 to 50 years were likely to flood in the next five. This isn’t the first time real estate agents have complained about climate risk scores.

According to Shopify’s status page , the company has found and fixed the issue. The disruption is particularly problematic given that customers were actively searching for deals on Cyber Monday, one of the busiest online shopping days of the year. Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company reports Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S. The issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. Shopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage. The exact number of affected merchants is unclear.

The semiconductor giant announced Alpamayo-R1, an open reasoning vision language model for autonomous driving research at the NeurIPS AI conference in San Diego, California. The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to “see” their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive. This new model is based on Nvidia’s Cosmos-Reason model , a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August. Technology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post . Nvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the “common sense” to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do. This new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face. Alongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub — collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook — to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation. These announcements come as the company is pushing full-speed into physical AI as a new avenue for its advanced AI GPUs.

In a blog post , he added that “the makeup of the development team changed,” and he was unable to find the right collaborators to grow the app. Brownlee was inspired to create Panels because when he posts video reviews of phones, tablets, and computers, fans always point out how stunning his wallpapers and lock screens are. When he first announced the app, he pointed out that if you type “where does mkbhd …” into Google, one of the first suggestions is “… get his wallpapers.” Panels partnered with artists to sell distinct, high-resolution wallpapers, which users could access at a cost of $50 per year, or $12 per month (the artists got a cut of those payments). But Brownlee couldn’t overcome the challenge of trying to create a paying market for something that consumers are not accustomed to paying for — it’s easier to just pull an image from the internet, or take a cute photo of your dog. Thanks to Brownlee’s stature, Panels ranked No. 1 on the iOS and Google Play charts for photos apps during its launch month. The app couldn’t sustain that momentum.

Meanwhile, a grid monitor is blaming such growth for high electricity prices.", "content": "Planned data center construction shows no signs of fading, with new additions to require 2.7x — nearly triple — the sector’s current demand for electricity over the next decade, according to a new report from BloombergNEF. By 2035, data centers will draw 106 gigawatts, up sharply from the 40 gigawatts they use today. Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, BloombergNEF said . Driving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatt. At the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute.

Europol confirmed the seizure in a press release , where it called Cryptomixer “the platform of choice for cybercriminals seeking to launder illegal proceeds from a variety of criminal activities, such as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, ransomware attacks, and payment card fraud.” Since 2016, Europol said, Cryptomixer facilitated the laundering of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in Bitcoin. Hackers and other criminals use laundering services such as Cryptomixer to obfuscate and hide the provenance of their cryptocurrency.

As many digital currencies provide a public ledger of all transactions, mixing services make it difficult to trace specific coins, thus concealing the origin of cryptocurrency,” Europol said.

With the new Festivitas app for iPhone and iPad, you can add and customize a string of holiday lights on your device’s Home Screen using iOS widgets. The lights can frame your favorite personal photo (or perhaps a holiday image you dig up on Pinterest), and you can opt to make the widget transparent so it blends in with your background. While seasonal apps can sometimes be low-quality cash grabs, developer Simon Støvring puts genuine effort and thoughtfulness into Festivitas’ design — and doesn’t charge an arm and a leg, either. Instead, the app is available for free to consumers, with premium features that can be unlocked for a fair price of between $3.99 and $9.99. (You get to choose the price that works best for you.) On both macOS and iOS, you can customize the holiday lights in multiple ways, beyond picking their colors and flashing pattern. You can adjust the cable’s thickness, its drop width and height, and choose from pre-made color palettes like Candy Cane, Winter Snow, Elf, and others, or you can design your own. You can also make finer adjustments to things like the colors’ hue or temperature, the speed of the flashes, and the spacing between the lights. Another perk is that you’ll be able to use the lights again outside of the winter holidays, as you can now change the bulb shape to designs like a bat, clover, Easter egg, heart, ghost, star, “2026,” and more throughout the year.

Thrive Holdings operates like a private equity firm for AI, rolling up companies that it believes could benefit from the tech in sectors like accounting and IT services. Neither company disclosed the terms of the deal, but it will involve OpenAI sending employees from its engineering, research, and product teams to work within Thrive’s companies to accelerate AI adoption and boost efficiency. If those companies succeed, OpenAI’s stake will grow, and it will get compensated for its services, according to a source familiar with the matter. The partnership follows a pattern of circular dealmaking for the $500 billion AI giant, which also recently took stakes in infrastructure partners like Advanced Micro Devices and CoreWeave . For instance, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy Nvidia chips. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave’s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI’s stake more valuable. The Thrive deal has a different structure, but the result is still interdependence. Here is how it will work. OpenAI embeds its own workers to build products and implement systems in Thrive’s portfolio companies. OpenAI profits when those companies scale based on growth its work helped generate.

The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble. Nvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia’s AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys’ electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release . The deal gave Synopsys’ stock a lift by signaling long-term growth — a boon after the company recently reported weakness in its IP segment due to U.S. export restrictions and issues at a major customer. For Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys’ widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions.

They only increased by 20% when Rufus wasn't used.", "content": "Amazon’s AI chatbot, Rufus , saw a surge of adoption on Black Friday, according to new data published over the weekend by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower . In the U.S., Amazon sessions that resulted in a purchase surged 100% on Black Friday compared with the trailing 30 days, while sessions that resulted in a purchase and didn’t include Rufus increased by only 20%. In addition, Amazon saw a 75% day-over-day increase for sessions that included Rufus and resulted in a purchase, compared with just a 35% day-over-day increase for sessions without Rufus that had resulted in a purchase. The firm also noted that Amazon sessions that involved the AI chatbot outpaced total website sessions. On Black Friday, Amazon’s total website sessions increased by 20% day-over-day, while those that involved Rufus were up by 35%. Amazon’s AI chat was first launched into beta in early 2024 before rolling out to all U.S. customers later that year . Today, Rufus helps Amazon shoppers find products, get recommendations, and perform product comparisons. Rufus’ adoption to drive Black Friday sales is part of a broader surge in consumers turning to AI to help them with holiday shopping, data shows. According to e-commerce data from Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 805% year-over-year on Black Friday. This indicates that consumers more heavily embraced generative AI chatbots to find deals and research products this year. The AI tools were mostly used for popular Black Friday deal categories like electronics, video games, appliances, toys, personal care items, and baby and toddler products. Adobe Analytics also noted that the use of AI increased conversions. It found U.S. shoppers who came to a retail site from an AI service were 38% more likely to buy, compared with non-AI traffic sources. Whether AI directly contributed to the record Black Friday spending of $11.8 billion is less clear.

The deal happened because Clipbook’s founder, Adam Joseph, took a long shot with a cold email that he never thought anyone would read, he told TechCrunch. Joseph launched Clipbook in 2023 and bootstrapped it to a million dollars in annual recurring revenue, he said. At that point, about a year ago, he felt he was ready to find investors. “I literally made a list of the top five media investors in the world,” Joseph recalled. His product uses AI to help companies track what the world says about them and their competitors in the press, across podcasts, and in social media. So he wanted investors who understood that scene. Mark Cuban, who has founded media networks, starred on “Shark Tank,” written books, produced movies, and is regularly interviewed on TV, was at the top of Joseph’s list. So, one evening in late 2024, Joseph drank a beer for courage and sent a one-page investment pitch via cold email to everyone on the list. No warm intro. Cuban, alone, answered. It turns out, busy and inundated with pitches as he is, Cuban still scans his own emails. He’s always looking for his next deal. “I have literally invested tens of millions of dollars from emails, and a lot of them have paid off, turned into unicorns,” Cuban tells TechCrunch about why he answered Clipbook. But before Cuban cracked open his checkbook, he put Joseph through a series of tests. His first email response “was the most skeptical 20 questions that he could ever ask,” Joseph recalled. Cuban admits he’s fairly famous for that from “Shark Tank.” “When I start to pepper them, they wilt, right? They wilt or they get angry at a certain level,” Cuban explained. “It’s their baby. They don’t like to be questioned, yeah? But Adam was just like, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.” After answering every question to Cuban’s satisf", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/how-ai-pr-startup-clipbook-won-mark-cubans-investment-from-a-cold-email/", "timestamp": 1764680627.585316}

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Melinda French Gates, welcome to The Big Interview . Thank you so much for being here. MELINDA FRENCH GATES: Thanks for having me, Katie.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades.

The 48-ounce stainless steel container is not only huge and hygienic, the machine itself combines an intuitive touch interface with a refined, timeless design. The non-reactive stainless steel material resists stains, odors, and corrosion, and expertly handles hot, cold, and acidic ingredients. This futuristic gadget also has an automatic self-cleaning program and ten blending programs for popular items like smoothies, soups, frozen cocktails and more for a precise blend, every time. Vitamix has tons of ways to save on these handy kitchen gear items, including $25 off when you register your email. All you have to do is input your email on Vitamix’s website, and you’ll get a discount of up to $25 sent straight to your inbox. Plus, you’ll get free shipping on orders of $100 or more. Glad you asked. Vitamix is offering free standard shipping for orders above $99. This pretty much means that ground shipping is free for blenders at the current discounts. Priority shipping is not free, however. WIRED has long been singing the praises of the classic Vitamix 5200.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air.

I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance.

However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers.

It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now.

Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work.

This one offered by Amazon , for example, is a Gorilla Tag bundle, which is currently the most popular game on the platform. It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played. For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR. Meanwhile, Best Buy is offering a bundle with the game The Walking Dead: Sinners & Saints for the same price of $249. That's a $20 game. But it also comes with a $50 Best Buy e-gift card.

We've also found the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals and deals under $100 , if you need to scoop a last-minute holiday gift. Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them.

Norway, however, is bucking the trend—thanks to a tax incentive system that will soon be rolled back.", "content": "The slump does not stop. Tesla sales in Europe slumped again in November 2025, confirming a negative trend that has been going on for more than a year. Data reported by Reuters shows monthly registrations of Tesla automobiles—an accurate way of measuring sales—halved compared to the same month in 2024 in the continent's main markets: down 58 percent in France, minus 59 percent in Sweden, and  down 49 percent in Denmark. In Germany, where the Elon Musk -controlled automaker has its only European plant, on the outskirts of Berlin, recorded just 750 vehicles sold in October, less than half the number sold a year earlier. The big exception to this downward trend is in Norway, where registrations of Tesla cars nearly tripled, to 6,215 units. The numbers for the first 10 months of 2025 expose a structural crisis. Tesla lost about 30 percent of European sales compared to the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association , the body that groups the industry's manufacturers on the Continent. Tesla's market share in the electric car segment fell from 12.6 percent in May 2024 to 7.2 percent in May 2025, according to analysis by Schmidt Automotive. Volkswagen took the lead among electric vehicle manufacturers by selling 133,465 units in the first six months of the year versus Tesla's 108,878, and Chinese manufacturer BYD sold more than twice as many cars as its US rival in October. The reasons for the decline are many. Musk's political stances have alienated a significant portion of his European customer base, particularly in Germany where the entrepreneur has publicly supported Alternative für Deutschland, Germany's far-right party known as AfD. Musk's virtual participation in an AfD election rally in January 2025, during which he called on Germans to overcome guilt over their Nazi past, triggered a wave of boycotts.

Check out our guides to the best backpacking tents and best car camping tents for more details. Six Moon Design's Lunar Solo (7/10, WIRED Review) is my favorite single-wall ultralight solo tent. It's not without its quirks ( read the pitching tips ), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat. It's well ventilated for a single-walled tent, with the ability to raise up the front door when weather is nice. I also like that it only needs one trekking pole (or one pole if you don't hike with trekking poles). You'd be hard-pressed to find a tent even half this nice at this price.

The first significant snowfall of the year just hit much of the country, from Philly to Boston to Kansas City . But not only will grilling season be back very soon, but the holidays are also actually a great time to cook outdoors , since smoking a big piece of meat leaves your oven free for sides. Which is why we're scoping some sales on our favorite grills this Cyber Monday. Most of the products on our list of the best grills are currently marked with some type of discount, though many of them have been priced that way for a while. Among the ones actually discounted, you find the T raeger Woodridge Pro that we reviewed very positively below $1,000 on Amazon , which is $200 off the price we normally see it at. Amazon has a ton of other big Traeger discounts , too, including $100 off the budget Pro Series 22 and $130 off the larger Pro 34 , which has 800-plus inches of cooking area. Traeger Amazon Home Depot You'll see a lot of sales marked for Weber products like the classic Original Kettle , but it's actually been selling for $142 for a long time, according to our tracking. You can probably wait for spring on that one. However, Recteq is another brand offering the biggest discounts we've seen recently. The Flagship 1600 is a smoker and grill with massive grate space (1600 square inches, as the name implies) and has impressive specs, including the ability to go low and slow for 40 hours nonstop with a full hopper. It also has wifi connectivity and can get up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit for searing steaks and burgers. The Cyber Monday price is $1,250 , the lowest we've tracked, and it's often sold for its full $1,600 list price. The more modestly priced kettle-shaped Recteq RT-B380 is also the cheapest we've seen it at $425.

Any such discounts are few and far between, and sell out almost immediately thanks to our old friends, the scalpers (shakes fist). Check your local card shops for cards that aren't priced scarily high over MSRP. But if you're shopping for a Pokémon fan, there are still some Cyber Monday discounts worth perusing that'll make great gifts, and I've rounded them up below. We haven't hand-tested everything in this list, but we know WIRED readers are searching for Pokémon gifts.

This little Pikachu Squishmallow can be clipped onto either, and might I say that it'd look mighty fine attached to a stocking on the morning of a certain holiday? I can attest to the clip's durability—I have a similar plush charm from the brand that I've toted to music festivals across the country. It's still going strong despite putting it through situations no keychain should be forced to endure. Lite Brite Amazon This Lite Brite comes with six Pokémon-themed templates and 1,000 pegs for endless creativity. ColourPop Amazon Reviewer Louryn Strampe has loved ColourPop since 2014, and this themed lip balm automatically adjusts to a rosy pink shade that'll suit any skin color.

Arlo Amazon Best Buy Arlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and direct Wi-Fi connection, and the Pro 5S is my pick of the best outdoor security cameras . The Arlo app is swift to load, offers rich notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. TP-Link Amazon B&H TP-Link As my top pick of the best indoor security cameras , the Tapo C120 has everything. It records video at up to 2K resolution, supports two-way audio (with a slight lag), and supports up to 512-GB microSD cards for local recording. There's impressive color night vision, on-device smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) without a subscription, and it even has an IP66 rating, which means you can also use it outdoors (provided you can run the power cable). We like this camera at its usual price (it hovers around $35), so this is a deal worth bagging. Nest Amazon Walmart Google Best Buy Doorbells don’t get smarter than this, and the Nest Doorbell tops our best video doorbells guide.

Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more. Most of it will be garbage, but you'll be learning. If you need a new camera to get you to do that, then carry on, there are some truly great deals to be had right now.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media , a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here . The findings bring up questions about who exactly has access to footage collected by Flock surveillance cameras and where people reviewing the footage may be based. Flock has become a pervasive technology in the US, with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use every day to investigate things like carjackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock’s business—creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors US residents’ movements—means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs. Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by. Law enforcement are then able to search cameras nationwide to see where else a vehicle has driven. Authorities typically dig through this data without a warrant, leading the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation to recently sue a city blanketed in nearly 500 Flock cameras. Broadly, Flock uses AI or machine learning to automatically detect license plates, vehicles, and people , including what clothes they are wearing, from camera footage.

Maybe that's a good thing, considering that many of those artificial intelligence features aren't very useful right now.

It's otherwise expected to be a processor bump, so don't expect much else. If you just want a simple, big-screen tablet to catch up on shows, do some work, and even play games, the iPad A16 fits the bill. It's powerful enough for most apps and games, and the 11-inch screen size is not too big and not too small. This iPad recently got a whole lot more versatile with the iPadOS 26 update , which adds windowing features, turning the iPad experience into a Mac.

Let's move on.", "content": "My little theory is that the concept of “imprinting” in psychology can just as easily be applied to programming: Much as a baby goose decides that the first moving life-form it encounters is its parent, embryonic programmers form ineradicable attachments to the patterns and quiddities of their first formative language. For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described. My dislike for it was immediate. To arrive at a language late is to see it without the forgiving haze of sentimentality that comes with imprinting—the fond willingness to overlook a flaw as a quirk. What I saw wasn’t a bejeweled tool but a poor little thing that hadn’t quite gotten the news that the world of programming had moved on. Ruby was created in 1995 by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro Matsumoto, affectionately called “Matz.” Aside from creating the only major programming language to have originated outside the West, this Osaka-born practicing Mormon is also known for being exceptionally nice, so much so that the Ruby community adopted the motto MINASWAN, for “Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.” Befitting this, as well as its pretty name, Ruby is easy on the eyes. Its syntax is simple, free of semicolons or brackets. More so even than Python —a language known for its readability—Ruby reads almost like plain English.

More buttons: At a minimum, a good gaming mouse should have a clickable scroll wheel, a button for adjusting sensitivity, and two buttons where your thumb rests. Those extra thumb buttons can be lifesavers in competitive games. Better buttons: They should also have higher-quality buttons, and more of them, than a standard office mouse. The left and right buttons should have individual switches inside, tensioned to register rapid clicks and reinforced to withstand more frequent clicks than a normal mouse.

The original V1 came out in 2006 , and the nameplate has been under constant production since. In that time, the DeathAdder has maintained its shape and ergonomics, but nearly everything else has changed. The mouse’s weight has halved, its polling rate has increased eightfold, and the maximum dots per inch (dpi) has increased by 25 times. To add to that, the new DeathAdder V4 Pro packs all of this into a wireless design. It's a great example of how far mouse technology has come over the past two decades. Over the years, I’ve watched mice progress in every way. With higher-performance sensors, improved switches, higher polling rates, and lower weights, it’s hard to argue that a mouse from 2006 is still competitive. At the same time, not all of those specs matter much to the average user. Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro Rating: 9/10 Sure, there’s a difference between 1,000- and 8,000-Hz polling, or 0.1 and 0.2 milliseconds of latency, but it's marginal compared to a new switch that feels better to press, a body that’s sturdy during use, or a design that saves 10 grams of weight. Time and time again, I find that the physical aspects of a mouse will have a much more direct and tangible impact on the user experience than any high-end internals. That’s what the DeathAdder V4 Pro gets right: It feels good to use. The buttons are snappy with a short travel distance but provide just enough resistance that resting your hand on them doesn’t risk a mis-input. The mouse wheel feels tight and notchy, with short ratchets that easily snap into place as you scroll. The overall shape is slightly sculpted, with a subtle ergonomic curve on either side. The mouse feels agile and responsive—it fits into your hand, but isn’t so sculpted that your hand sinks into it. ( Logitech's MX Master line does the inverse perfectly, which makes it specialized for productivity , but not ideal for high-intensity gaming.)

Coffee tastes best in the fall because this is when all the espresso makers, coffee machine makers, and coffee grinder makers trot out their best deals.

I usually advise people to wait to buy espresso machines on Prime Day in the summer, or right now during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale weekend.

Breville Amazon Best Buy Seattle Coffee Gear Breville Barista Express is the unparalleled blockbuster of the espresso world, long one of WIRED's top picks and long the best-selling machine of its kind on Amazon. The reasons are simple. It hits that Goldilocks sweet spot of taste, ease, and affordability—and never more so than during big sales events. It's still the one I recommend as the best device for most people, especially as a starter to the espresso world. If you're looking for a machine with a grinder included, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better or more reliable semi-automatic machine than this Breville. This thing has been chugging happily along.

A 29-year-old teacher and musician from Richmond, Virginia, Yongbanthom didn’t know much about Facebook Dating before creating a profile in 2023. Still, his matches sort of made sense. “It’s just a mom thing to be on Facebook, I guess,” he says of the perception around the social network . What Yongbanthom couldn’t figure out was why he also kept matching with people who were so far away. “No one is ever near me, which is interesting given there are so many users on Facebook Dating.” Twenty-one million users, actually. In November, for the first time since its launch in 2019, Meta shared with WIRED user information about Facebook Dating, and the figures landed to the sound of collective astonishment. Suddenly, the platform was a secret hit—and bigger than Hinge, its closest rival. Even more bewildering was how Facebook Dating seems to be slowly catching on among young people, with 1.77 million daily active US users between ages 18 and 29, a stat that challenges the idea that only boomers use Facebook. According to a Pew survey from last year, 32 percent of teen respondents said they use Facebook compared to 71 percent in 2015, though Facebook Dating notes that daily conversations among its 18-to-29 demographic increased by 24 percent in 2024. Facebook Dating is not like any other dating app on the market. It’s technically not even an app. Like Marketplace or Groups, it’s a service within the Facebook app. It also doesn’t depend on a subscription model like Bumble or Tinder, a major advantage when onboarding new users. That’s what Olivia Nwokoma, a 24-year-old hospitality worker in Maryland, likes about it the most. “It doesn’t block the better features behind a paywall,” she says. Nwokoma, who is always on the lookout for a good deal on Facebook Marketplace, prefers men over 6 feet, so when a dating app allows for it—and Facebook Dating does—she will often filter by height.

It was the first brand on the market to introduce AI bird identification, as well as the first to introduce auxiliary products like smart nesting boxes , birdbaths (see below), and feeder bodies made from different materials like wood or metal. The products still suffer the occasional quirk or connectivity issue, but all smart feeders do. The Birdfys remain my go-to for gifts and personal use at my home due to their consistency and ease of use. If you're looking to buy one this year for yourself or a loved one, these are the best prices you'll see, and these are the most giftable models, most usable out of the box without a subscription.

I know multiple people who were gifted a smart bird feeder last year for the holidays and still, in November 2025, have yet to take it out of the box. Apparently they're not alone, because there's now a feeder specifically for the reluctant: the Rookie, which looks like a gravity pet feeder and snaps together in three simple pieces with no tools. You'll still have to charge the 1080p camera (once a week, as this version doesn't come with a solar panel) and calibrate it to the app, but that's it—just pop the camera on its little side stand, fill the seed hopper, attach it to a wall or pole with the included hardware, and you're good to go.

Simple home options that feel good and make physiological sense for everyday digestion.​​", "content": "Bloating often follows fast eating, excess salt, fizzy drinks, or slow gastric emptying. Focus on gentle carminatives, digestive enzymes, fiber, and fluids to move gas along and calm gut muscles after meals. Small portions work best.​ Chew 1 teaspoon fennel seeds or sip warm fennel tea. Compounds like anethole relax intestinal muscles and help trapped gas pass. It is a classic post meal habit with supportive evidence for easing bloating.​ A cup after meals can relax smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract via menthol and ease cramps and gas. People with acid reflux should be cautious as peppermint can aggravate symptoms.​ Fresh ginger in hot water or grated into food can speed gastric emptying and reduce fullness. Gingerols and shogaols support motility and reduce discomfort in simple indigestion.​ Eat a small bowl of ripe papaya. Papain is a protein digesting enzyme that helps meals break down more completely and can ease bloating after heavy or protein rich dishes.​ Have one to two kiwis. Actinidin helps digest proteins and dietary fiber supports regularity, which can reduce constipation related bloating. Many people notice a gentler belly within hours.​  ​ (Disclaimer: This story is strictly for educational purposes only and does not substitute any professional medical advice and should not be considered as professional medical advice.)

Eat this one protein rich food three times a week and feel the magic", "summary": "", "content": "Chickpeas aren't trendy nutrition speak. They're real food that does real work. One cup of boiled chickpeas serves 14.5 grams of protein, 12.5 grams of fiber, plus iron and folate. Eat them three times weekly for eight to twelve weeks, and your body recalibrates. Energy lifts. Hunger quiets. Cholesterol drops. That's the pattern researchers keep documenting. Chickpeas pack all nine essential amino acids except methionine, making them a complete protein source. Athletes and desk workers alike gain from this amino acid profile. Your muscles repair faster post-workout. Vegans who nail chickpea intake maintain strength without animal products. Three weekly servings build and preserve lean mass sustainably. Chickpeas have a low glycemic index. Your blood sugar won't skyrocket after eating them. The fiber slows carbohydrate absorption. The protein blunts glucose swings. A twelve-week study showed people eating chickpeas daily lowered fasting insulin levels notably. For prediabetics and diabetics, this steady burn is transformative for daily stability. A research trial had seventy-two people with prediabetes eat one cup of chickpeas daily for twelve weeks. Total cholesterol fell from two hundred milligrams per deciliter to one hundred eighty-six. That shift moves your numbers back to the healthy zone. Three times weekly offers cumulative benefits for your lipid profile over months. Chickpeas contain resistant starch and prebiotic fiber. These feed beneficial gut bacteria. Your microbiome composition changes. Gut barrier integrity strengthens. Inflammation in your digestive tract quiets. Regular consumption enhances intestinal health and may reduce colon cancer risk. Your digestion becomes smoother, less bloated. Fiber in chickpeas prolongs fullness. You eat less throughout the day. Protein curbs cravings. Studies show pulse eaters consume fewer total calories naturally. You're not white-knuckling willpower; your body simply feels satisfied sooner.

It is the country’s yearly money map.​ Since 2017 the Budget is presented on February 1 so ministries can get Parliament’s approval before April 1, which is the new financial year, and start spending on time without using temporary funds.​ Budget 2026 is prepared under the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance. The Finance Minister leads a months-long process to plan income and spending for the next year. It starts about six months before presentation in Parliament. Around August to September the Finance Ministry sends a Budget Circular telling all ministries what numbers to submit, expected receipts and spending for current and next year, which senior officials then review and forward. ​ Ministries send three sets of numbers: Budget Estimates for next year, Revised Estimates for this year, and Provisional Actuals for last year, so trends are visible and mistakes can be corrected early.​ The Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs prepare revenue estimates. These are consolidated with expenditure plans to form the final Union Budget. The Finance Ministry meets ministries and stakeholders like farmers and small businesses, checks what is affordable, and balances needs with total money available, including planned borrowing and savings.​If ministries and the Finance Ministry disagree on funds the issue goes to the Union Cabinet or the Prime Minister for a final decision, so that the priorities are aligned in accordance with national goals.​ The Cabinet signs off the Budget draft, then printing begins with a traditional halwa ceremony, and officials involved stay in a secure zone to keep proposals confidential until presentation day.​ The Finance Minister gives the Budget Speech in the Lok Sabha then lays documents in", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-budget-2026-how-a-union-budget-is-drafted-reviewed-and-presented-in-parliament/slideshow/125717988.cms", "timestamp": 1764680665.1231983}

She explains what’s actually good for you and what you should skip.", "content": "Nutritionist Suman Agarwal , known for simplifying nutrition with facts, breaks down the difference between sugar, jaggery , honey , dates , monk fruit, and stevia in her latest Instagram reel. She explains what’s actually good for you and what you should skip. Sugar is the most refined form of sweetness and is made of pure sucrose, offering zero nutrients and causing a rapid spike in blood glucose . With a high glycemic index of around 65 and about 387 calories per 100 grams, Suman says sugar gives only empty calories and should be kept to a minimum in daily meals. Jaggery is a minimally processed sweetener that keeps some natural minerals like iron, magnesium, and potassium . However, it still acts like sugar in the body, carrying a glycemic index of about 84 and ~383 calories per 100 grams. Suman Agarwal says jaggery can be chosen occasionally, but it shouldn’t be treated as a “free” or unlimited sweetener. Honey provides natural enzymes and small antioxidants , but it is still high in sugar and calorically dense with 304 kcal/100g and a GI close to 58–60. Suman explains that while honey is more natural, it should still be consumed lightly, not daily in excess. Dates are one of the most nutritious sweeteners because they contain fiber , potassium , iron, and natural antioxidants . With a GI between 42 and 55 and ~282 kcal per 100 g, they release sugar more slowly than honey or jaggery. Suman highlights dates as one of the most balanced natural sweeteners when used mindfully. Both stevia and monk fruit are plant-derived sweeteners that provide sweetness with no calories and a GI of 0, so they don’t impact blood sugar at all. Suman Agarwal highlights that stevia sometimes has a sharp, slightly bitter aftertaste, while monk fruit has a cleaner, more sugar-like finish , which many people prefer. Artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose, acesulfame-K , and saccharin may be calorie-free, but Suman Agarwal warns they can disrupt gut health, increase cravings, con", "url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/the-real-difference-between-sugar-jaggery-amp-honey/slideshow/125716912.cms", "timestamp": 1764680672.4130607}

For more than three weeks, Imran Khan’s family and PTI leaders have been attempting to meet the imprisoned leader, but their requests have reportedly gone unanswered. This has fuelled growing speculation that the cricketer-turned-politician might be dead. In response to the growing worries over the PTI founder's condition in Adiala Jail , party members have scheduled demonstrations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister and PTI leader Sohail Afridi announced a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and a demonstration outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on Tuesday. The KP CM also called on all PTI members to immediately mobilize to Islamabad and later gather near Adiala Jail. Furthermore, all PTI parliamentarians plan to stage a protest at the IHC before the chief justice on Tuesday. “This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi said. In anticipation of these large-scale gatherings, authorities moved to restrict public assembly. Section 144, which bans public gatherings, was imposed across Islamabad and Rawalpindi. This comes despite existing restrictions on public assembly that have been in place since 18 November. The Rawalpindi deputy commissioner’s office confirmed the imposition of Section 144 from 1 December to 3 December. A central point of contention is Khan's alleged isolation. PTI leader Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in \"complete isolation\" since 4 November. He also stated that Khan’s sisters, senior party figures, legal counsel, and even personal doctors have been prevented from meeting him, effectively placing him in solitary confinement. Khan’s family asserts that court-ordered prison visits remain blocked.

PTI leaders say they have been repeatedly denied permission to meet their incarcerated founding chairman, prompting the party to organise demonstrations outside both Adiala Jail and the Islamabad High Court (IHC). According to Dawn , the plan was finalised despite the authorities enforcing fresh curbs on public assembly. PTI leader Asad Qaiser told the publication that lawmakers from both houses of parliament would begin their protest outside the IHC before moving towards the jail. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” Qaiser said. Qaiser added that he would address a public gathering in Quetta on Tuesday, while advocate Gohar Ali Khan and other senior PTI figures would lead demonstrations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The PTI protests will unfold under a sweeping ban on public gatherings, implemented by both local and federal Pakistani authorities. The Rawalpindi district administration issued a three-day ban, effective Monday, while Islamabad’s administration imposed a two-month prohibition starting from 18 November. The move has been criticised by PTI as an attempt to suppress political opposition and prevent supporters from drawing attention to what they describe as a violation of Imran Khan’s fundamental rights. PTI maintains that Imran Khan’s family members and senior party leaders have been denied access to him for several weeks.

Many states close schools from late December to early January. Check out more details.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "December school holidays in India differ from state to state. Yet, a few clear patterns help parents plan ahead. Christmas Day on 25 December is the only nationwide holiday, and all schools remain closed. Many states schedule their winter break in the last part of the month. Schools in Uttar Pradesh usually close from 20 to 31 December, which gives students around 12 days off. PM SHRI schools in several states follow a break from 23 December to 1 January, which adds up to 10 days. In Madhya Pradesh, many districts observe holidays on 23 December or 24 December. The school holidays end either on 31 December or in the first few days of January. Jammu and Kashmir’s winter zone follows a different rhythm. Harsh weather shuts many classes from late November to late February. So, December is entirely off. Delhi keeps December largely academic as pre-board exams happen. Still, schools shut on 25 December and shift into winter vacation only at the very end of the month. In Haryana , Punjab, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, most schools also follow a pattern of closing during the final 10 days of December. However, exact dates are announced in individual state circulars. Some regions also observe local holidays tied to festivals or district-level events, which may impact select schools. Parents are advised to check their school’s official notice as final schedules are issued locally. December brings a set of region-specific school holidays across India. These vary widely. Goa schools usually close on 3 December for the Feast of St Francis Xavier and on 19 December for Liberation Day in Goa, Daman and Diu. Jammu and Kashmir schools shut on 5 December for Sheikh Abdullah Jayanti. Meghalaya observes holidays on 12 and 18 December. Chhattisgarh marks a holiday on 18 December. Some states treat 24 December as an optional day off. Many schools start their winter break from this date. Haryana, Telangana and several northeastern states also note holidays on 26 and 27 December.

The Chief Adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus , has also expressed his concerns about Zia's health condition. He had sent another adviser, Asif Nazrul, to the hospital on Friday to inquire about Khaleda Zia's condition.

Notably, as the court have extended the deadline to claim the settlement payment from November 18 to December 18, here's how to check if you are eligible for the sum, and how to apply for it. The company faced multiple lawsuits across the US for “repeatedly” failing to protect consumer data, as per an AP report. AT&T informed millions of customers that their personal data, including Social Security numbers and call records, was compromised in two breaches in 2024. Reports said that the breaches affected over seven million of AT&T customers in 2024, and more than 65 million customers between 2019-2024. While it denies wrongdoing, in a statement to the media the company said it opted to settle to avoid a long legal battle. “We have agreed to this settlement to avoid the expense and uncertainty of protracted litigation. AT&T remains committed to protecting our customers’ data and ensuring their continued trust in us,” it stated. Customers in both data breaches are eligible for claims. The court has awarded two settlement classes, based on different cases, which customers can file for separately. While the combined settlement amount is $177 million for both breaches , a preliminary order in June showed that the first settlement class can claim up to $149 million, while the second settlement class can claim combined $28 million, the AP report added.

Senior defence, intelligence and foreign policy officials gathered in the Oval Office to determine next steps in a rapidly escalating regional confrontation that has sparked legal questions, congressional scrutiny and fears of a widening conflict. The high-level meeting — with attendees arriving shortly before 5 p.m. — brought together key members of Trump’s national security inner circle, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller were also expected. It follows the administration’s recent strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug-trafficking vessels and a rapid build-up of US military assets in the Caribbean as part of “ Operation Southern Spear ”. The Pentagon has now deployed more than a dozen warships and 15,000 troops to the region. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier in the day that Trump was “meeting with his national security team on this subject and on many matters,” adding: “It’s part of his responsibility to ensure that peace is ongoing throughout the world.” The administration is facing mounting bipartisan concerns about the legality of recent operations targeting alleged drug boats — particularly reports that the US conducted a follow-up strike on survivors after the initial attack. “The law is clear,” Sen. Angus King told CNN . “If the facts are, as have been alleged, that there was a second strike specifically to kill the survivors in the water — that’s a stone-cold war crime. It’s also murder.” On Monday, Leavitt identified the official who authorised the second strike: Adm. Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley, commander of US Special Operations Command.

This latest development has caused immense confusion over the rapper's condition. According to a TMZ report, POORSTACY, whose real name is Carlito Junior Milfort, passed away early on Saturday after a sudden medical emergency at a Boca Raton hotel. The report cited police officials to confirm the news of the death of the rapper, who has worked closely with Travis Barker . Authorities have not released details about what led to his apparent death. The police said that the artist had been staying at the hotel for nearly 10 days with a woman and a toddler. No one else was hospitalised. As social media started flooding with RIP messages for the rapper, a friend of POORSTACY, under the Instagram handle ‘@hoodunderratchet’, reposted a story citing the TMZ report, and said he was “still fighting”. “This n*** has not f**king passed yet!!!! I will say RIP when he is gone my brudda stil fighting and when the plug gets pulled I will then say Rip... I love you brudda, (sic)” he wrote. This is the only known social media post to refute the TMZ report about the rapper's death; however, it did not say that the information about POORSTACY's hospitalisation was wrong. A number of fan comments on the rapper's social media profiles seem to suggest that he died by suicide ; however, authorities have not confirmed this claim yet. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner has, however, said that the cause of death is still under investigation. TMZ spoke to an employee at the Boca Raton hotel, who revealed that the rapper was taken to a local hospital on Saturday morning owing to a medical emergency. He had been living in the establishment for 10 days and had checked in with a woman and a toddler. There was no other report of injury at the hotel on Saturday.

NEW DELHI : A push by the Centre to curb phone-based scams by mandating a government app on every smartphone in circulation is likely to be opposed by the world’s largest handset makers — including Apple, Google, Samsung — and even industry bodies, according to multiple executives Mint spoke with. The app, Sanchar Saathi, offers cyber security and surveillance features. A non-removable government app may hinder a person’s right to choose, may conflict with India’s newly-minted data-privacy regime, and impose onerous compliance requirements, the executives said on condition of anonymity since their companies were still evaluating the government order. On 28 November, the department of telecommunications (DoT) under the ministry of communications issued a notification to companies that sell mobile phones in India to mandatorily pre-install Sanchar Saathi on all new phones, and use software updates to load them on phones that are already in use. Companies were given 90 days to comply and 120 days to file a compliance report, and asked to ensure that the app cannot be disabled or uninstalled at any point. Mint has seen a copy of the notification. The DoT reinforced its message with a post on social media platform X on Monday evening. To be sure, India has about 750-800 million smartphone users, and just over 150 million smartphones are sold in India every year, as per IDC. Two senior executives at electronics companies, who were privy to the notifications directly, said DoT’s notification was served to reduce the misuse of mobile phones in various scams. “The notification clearly states that Sanchar Saathi must be preinstalled in all mobile phones in order to make it easier for the Centre to track nefarious activities,\" the first of the two executives said. “Their idea is that if a smartphone’s IMEI (international mobile equipment identity) number is blacklisted on Sanchar Saathi, having t", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/centres-order-to-pre-install-sanchar-saathi-app-on-all-smartphones-sparks-industry-concern-11764593502702.html", "timestamp": 1764680687.0402346}

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop.

In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta?

Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture.

This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why?

Whether you’re heading to Europe, Asia, or anywhere in between, living and learning in a new culture offers you the chance to build skills that last a lifetime. So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success. Naturally, studying abroad improves language skills —especially if you’re living in a country where a different language is spoken", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/what-skills-do-you-gain-from-studying-abroad/", "timestamp": 1764680712.3263853}
