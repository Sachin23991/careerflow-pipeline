With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options.

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763655527.1208382}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues. Each student benefits from one-on-one interaction with tea", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/autistic-students-special-schools-autism-spectrum-disorder-campus-needs-children-day-2025-10349218/", "timestamp": 1763655531.467155}

Participating in international moot courts and research projects exposed me to diverse legal systems, and I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding global frameworks of justice and governance. The idea of studying abroad became less about a dream and more about an academic necessity — a step towards widening my perspective and grounding my legal education in an international context. I come from Chandigarh , and completed both my Class 10 and Class 12 from Shivalik Public School. My school, and the city itself, gave me a strong sense of grounding. My academic interests started shaping there, especially as I took part in debates, science exhibitions, and extracurricular activities that built my interest in public affairs and law.  After schooling, I moved to Symbiosis Law School, Noida, under Symbiosis International (Deemed) University, to pursue my BA LLB. degree.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES).

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763655547.8771062}

It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services. Speaking at the launch, Education Minister Ashish Sood said the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India and Viksit Bharat 2047. The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education.

The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends.

The minister made the announcement during an inspection of the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a Delhi government senior secondary residential school located in Isapur village, Najafgarh. During the visit, he held detailed discussions with officials and local residents about various educational and residential welfare schemes for students. Singh said that several hostels for school and college students across Delhi were shut down in the past due to the negligence of the previous government. He also alleged that irregularities had been reported in coaching institutes meant to prepare students for competitive examinations. According to a statement, the Isapur residential school was established for SC, OBC, minority, and orphan students, offering free accommodation, meals, uniforms, stationery, and medical services. The school also provided vocational training and sports facilities for the holistic development of students, it stated. However, it was closed in September 2024 due to the dilapidated condition of the building and lack of financial support. At the time of closure, nearly 800 students were enrolled against its capacity of 1,200, it read. During the inspection, Singh said the government’s focus is on ensuring quality education and a safe residential environment for children from underprivileged sections of society. He added that the government is actively working to reopen closed hostels and build new ones to meet the needs of students.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic. They influenced a well-known mathematician named Al-Khwarizmi, who lived in present-day Iraq.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive. UPSC reports from 2010 to 2021 show consistently low participation of women and transgender individuals in the Civil Services Examination, with 2021 being the most recent data available. According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam.

The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Seven IITs, which feature in the top 10 among Indian institutions in the QS Asia Rankings 2026, have seen a significant fall in their ranks this year compared to last year.

READ MORE| India’s top IITs rank slip as universities from China, Singapore surge ahead in QS Asia Rankings 2026 The ranking of Asian universities, released on Tuesday, reflects an eastward concentration of top performance, QS said. Indian institutions retain strong reputations but face stiff competition from those in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, which are outperforming them on metrics like ‘citations per paper’, which is a measure of the impact of research, faculty-student ratio, and international student ratio. Reacting to the rankings, Prof Chakraborty said: “The QS rankings are one of several reference points in a very broad and complex global higher education ecosystem. A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/qs-world-rankings-asia-universities-2026-ranks-indian-institutes-drop-rank-iit-kharagpur-director-reacts-suman-chakraborty-10347239/", "timestamp": 1763655555.956925}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Developed in collaboration with YNOS, an IIT Madras-incubated startup, the project aims to bridge the information gap that has long hindered founders, investors, and other ecosystem players. The initiative was launched by Dr Palanivel Thiagarajan, Minister for Information Technology and Digital Services, Government of Tamil Nadu , during the ‘TN Global Startup Summit’ held recently in Chennai . India’s startup ecosystem — the world’s third-largest — is expected to play a pivotal role in achieving the nation’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision and $5 trillion economy target, a statement released by IIT Madras noted, adding that yet, a major challenge remains the “information conundrum,” where data appears abundant but is fragmented and scattered, making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions. Addressing this issue, IIT Madras CREST and YNOS have developed India’s only independent digital platform dedicated to startups. The platform already hosts over 2.75 lakh startups, 15,000 angel investors, 5,500 venture capital firms, 1,400 incubators, 800 banks, and 110 government support schemes, making it the country’s largest and most comprehensive startup database. Explaining the objective, Prof Thillai Rajan A, head of CREST and faculty member at the Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras, said: “Information asymmetry has long been one of the biggest barriers for founders. Through the ‘Startups for All’ initiative, we aim to level the playing field by giving every entrepreneur and citizen — irrespective of location or background — equal access to credible information that supports smarter decisions and faster growth.

Speaking to indianexpress.com , he shared that although AIR 2 is a great achievement, it felt unreal. “I did not expect to secure AIR 2… It is a great feeling,” he said. Born and brought up in Hyderabad , Tejas comes from a family of Chartered Accountants – his father and brother are CAs – so his choice of profession seemed almost natural. “CA runs in the family, and I have always been interested in finances. I think CA is one of the best ways to gain comprehensive knowledge about the world of finances, and that is what drew me to this profession,” he said.

He appeared for the CA Foundation in 2021 and has been clearing all levels in his first attempt since then, including the Intermediate-level exams this year. His typical routine during the CA Final group exams was intense and disciplined. “I studied for about 12 hours during the final group preparation, along with regular workout sessions,” Tejas shared. But it was hardly all work and no play. Beyond the monotonous study sessions, Tejas looked forward to his weekend ritual with great anticipation. “Six days I study, and on Sundays I look forward to going out with friends for a 5-km run. It is something I really enjoy and helps me maintain balance,” he said. Tejas was also clear about the need to get coaching. “It helps you understand what to learn, what all to understand, and how to cover the syllabus. This is only possible with a professor or teacher’s help. Coaching is essential,” he said, adding that he left coaching after the Intermediate exams round and continued his pre", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/icai-ca-final-september-2025-result-hyderabad-tejas-mundada-air-2-first-attempt-social-media-marks-score-strategy-10343405/", "timestamp": 1763655560.7806554}

As a result of a settlement with the SEC, Curastory’s founder and CEO, Tiffany Kelly, has resigned from the role and replaced herself with Dave Dickman, former CEO of the influencer marketing platform Tagger. Under Dickman’s leadership, the company has begun fundraising, international expansion plans and product updates, Kelly and Dickman tell TechCrunch. The settlement agreement specifically barred Kelly for ten years from serving on the board of directors or as an executive at any company that would, essentially, fundraise. TechCrunch saw a version of this agreement that had not yet been finalized. It stated that Kelly agreed to these stipulations without admitting to or denying the allegations.

On Thursday, the company announced an integration with TuneMyMusic , a tool that can transfer playlists from other streaming services into users’ Spotify libraries. The new feature, which is rolling out now to all Spotify users, will be found in the “Your Library” section of the Spotify mobile app. To use TuneMyMusic, you’ll scroll to the bottom of the page, then tap on the new option to “Import your music” and follow the prompts to connect with the service. You can then choose the platform you’d like to transfer playlists from, and they’ll appear in your Spotify library. To be clear, this process doesn’t delete the original playlists — it only copies them over to Spotify. At launch, TuneMyMusic supports transferring playlists from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer, Pandora, SoundCloud, Tidal, YouTube Music, and others . The addition of the new feature ramps up the competition in the streaming wars, while also serving as a win for data portability. One of Spotify’s top competitors, Apple Music, already offers a way for iPhone and iPad users to transfer their saved music and playlists from other services to their Apple Music library via a feature that’s built directly into the iOS and iPadOS Settings app . That option is also available within the Android version of the Apple Music app. YouTube Music Premium users can import their playlists from other services, including Spotify, as well. For customers thinking of switching to Spotify, having the transfer feature built into Spotify could push them to make the jump. It’s a nice perk, too, since the online version of TuneMyMusic only offers to transfer 500 tracks for free. For unlimited transfers, users would have to upgrade to a paid plan. Spotify isn’t sharing the terms of its deal with TuneMyMusic, but it’s likely a win for both companies, as it could bring more customers to Spotify while TuneMyMusic snags a large cl", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/spotifys-latest-feature-lets-you-transfer-playlists-from-other-services/", "timestamp": 1763655833.5751083}

The project, dubbed “HyperVault,” comes as demand for AI compute is rising faster than companies can build the power-hungry infrastructure needed to support it. The demand-supply gap for AI compute in India is particularly stark: the country generates nearly 20% of the world’s data, but accounts for only about 3% of global data center capacity . Big tech companies and cloud providers have been investing billions of dollars to expand local capacity and tap the country’s growing adoption of AI products. With HyperVault, TCS and TPG plan to develop liquid-cooled, high-density data centers with the power and network capacity required to support advanced AI workloads across major cloud regions, the companies said. Liquid cooling and high-density rack designs are growing common as the GPUs needed to power AI inference and training use significantly more power and generate more heat than conventional CPU servers. But such designs also raise questions about resource use in countries like India, where water scarcity is already a concern. In urban hubs such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, where much of India’s data-center capacity is concentrated, existing water stress could complicate operations. S&P Global, citing Uptime Institute estimates, noted that a 1-MW data center load can require up to 25.5 million liters of water a year for cooling, adding pressure to already strained infrastructure. The rapid building of AI data centers stands to further stress India’s power and land use, two other bottlenecks identified by industry analysts. High-density AI clusters require reliable electricity supply and large parcels of industrial land, two requirements increasingly difficult to secure in major urban regions.

Dubbed Nano Banana Pro, the new model is built on Google’s latest large language model, Gemini 3 , released earlier this week. The company claims Nano Banana Pro improves on its predecessor, Nano Banana, with the ability to create more detailed images and accurate text, and generate text in different styles, fonts and languages. The model also has web searching capabilities, so you can do things like ask it to look up a recipe and generate flash cards. Google says Nano Banana Pro is geared towards giving professionals more control over images, and lets users  control aspects like camera angles, scene lighting, depth of field, focus, and color grading. And compared to Nano Banana’s resolution cap of 1024 x 1024px, users can generate 2K or 4K images with Nano Banana Pro. The company noted that while Nano Banana Pro can generate images at a higher quality, it is slower and costlier than the original model, which cost $0.039 per 1024px image. Comparatively, the new model costs $0.139 for each 1080p or 2K image, and $0.24 for every 4K image. The new model can use six high-fidelity shots or blend up to 14 objects within an image. It can also maintain consistency and resemblance of up to five people. The company has released a demo app where you can try some of these capabilities. Nano Banana Pro is being rolled out across many of Google’s existing AI tools.

The company said on Thursday that it will start manually driving its vehicles in those cities “in the coming days,” ahead of testing and validating its driverless tech, before eventually launching a commercial robotaxi service in each. These cities join a growing list of locations where Waymo has launched or plans to launch its robotaxis. The Alphabet-owned company is already offering rides on surface streets and highways in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, and is live in Austin and Atlanta as well. In 2026, Waymo plans to expand to Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City, and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo. The new cities announced Thursday could present some unique challenges for Waymo, though. Minneapolis has perhaps the harshest winters of the cities Waymo has chosen to date. Snow could challenge Waymo’s perception stack, and the lack of traction will give its automated driving system some extra work to do. New Orleans, meanwhile, has a lot of tight, one-way streets that are heavily used by pedestrians — especially in the French Quarter. As Waymo has expanded, it’s been working with partners in a number of cities to help operate its fleets. Its vehicles are on Uber’s app in Austin and Atlanta ; African mobility and fintech company Moove took over operations in Phoenix (and will do the same in Miami), and Avis Budget Group will manage the fleet in Dallas .

BOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The settlement lays to bed a drawn out, three-year fight between Samsung’s display division and BOE, both of whom supply display panels used in Apple’s iPhones. Samsung in December 2022 filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging that BOE had infringed its OLED patents, and then filed another case in October 2023 , accusing the Chinese company of stealing trade secrets by poaching employees to access confidential OLED manufacturing processes and technologies. In March 2025, the ITC ruled that BOE had infringed three of Samsung Display’s OLED patents. On the trade secret side, in a preliminary ruling handed down in July, the ITC found that BOE had misappropriated Samsung Display’s OLED trade secrets, and recommended banning the Chinese company from exporting OLED panels to the U.S. for nearly 15 years. Now, the companies appear to have asked the ITC to end its investigation. When reached for confirmation, the ITC declined to comment. The settlement comes as major tech companies try to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturers for components used in their devices. A U.S. export ban would have certainly been terrible news for BOE, which is one of the world’s largest suppliers of LCD and OLED display panels, behind Samsung and LG .

The startup is building a second sorting facility in Tennessee.", "content": "When it comes to recycling, few materials can match aluminum. It can be reused an infinite number of times, and it’s often cheaper to recycle than to produce new aluminum because it requires so much less energy.  Yet only about a third of the aluminum used in the U.S. gets recycled. The problem lies in sorting mixed aluminum scrap — a challenge that has long stumped the recycling industry. Michael Siemer, CEO of Sortera , thinks his company has found the key, though. Sortera says it has developed a system that can separate aluminum grades with over 95% accuracy — a breakthrough that could unlock a massive untapped resource in the recycling industry. Here’s how it works: The company uses an AI model that identifies different grades of aluminum based on data from lasers, X-ray fluorescence, and high-speed cameras. The system has to classify each chip — about the size of a large potato chip — in a fraction of a second. “Ten milliseconds is a long time,” Siemer says. Once the vision system identifies the grade, a series of nozzles blow precise puffs of air to flip the chip off the belt and into the correct bin. That speed and accuracy matters because other recycling operations must melt the aluminum first before they can tell which type of alloy it is. And if alloys aren’t sorted properly, the mixed heap is worth far less because customers can’t be confident it will have the properties they need. “People have been wanting to go after [this unsorted aluminum], and nobody’s been able to unlock it,” says Siemer. Sortera’s sorting accuracy has further helped the company unlock something else many startups seek: profitability. “The margin is exponential above 90%, [while] 92% gets you a nice little margin, 95% gets you a big margin, [and] 98% is a really big margin.” That’s helped the company become cash flow positive since August, he says, all based on the operation of a single plant in Indiana.

NestAI has also struck a partnership with Nokia to build AI products for defense applications and develop “ physical AI ,” which involves using large language models and related technology for robotics and other real-world applications. The funding will help NestAI build “Europe’s leading physical AI lab,” co-founder Peter Sarlin said at the Slush 2025 technology conference in Helsinki. Physical AI has been a growing research field both for Big Tech and startups, and NestAI’s funding round shows there’s space for European companies to develop homegrown solutions to address the continent’s needs — which have leaned towards defense applications due to prolonged Ukraine-Russia war. Last month, the startup announced it would support the Finnish Defense Forces in adopting AI. This focus on sovereignty may explain why NestAI has been in stealth so far, but it is now building in public, supported by Sarlin, who has been funding the venture for the past few months through his family office, PostScriptum . “In line with PostScriptum’s mission, NestAI has from the start set out to become Europe’s leading physical AI lab to drive technological sovereignty,” Sarlin told TechCrunch. “This partnership also marks an important step in securing Europe’s defense capabilities and sovereignty.” After selling AI startup Silo AI to AMD for $665 million last year, Sarlin has been active as a philanthropist and investor, backing startups like Legora and Lovable. While he’s building NestAI, his day job is still at AMD, and he will only act as the startup’s chairman, not its CEO.

The memo comes after Monarch Tractor was already cutting some positions over the last few weeks at its California corporate facilities and remote teams in India and Singapore, according to multiple former employees who spoke with TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity. Monarch Tractor was founded in 2018 by a team that included a former top executive at Tesla’s first gigafactory and Carlo Mondavi, a scion of the famous winemaking family. The company raised at least $220 million, including $133 million in 2024, as it pursued a goal of making “driver optional” autonomous tractors that could perform tasks at places like wineries and other fruit farms. While Monarch Tractor claims to have shipped around 500 of those tractors to date, the company announced a restructuring in late 2024 that was supposed see its tractors expand to other use cases, like pushing feed at dairy farming and maintaining golf courses. CEO Praveen Penmesta also said at the time that Monarch Tractor would focus more on selling software services and licensing the company’s autonomous tech. At least one customer — one of Monarch Tractors’ first dealers — claims the autonomous tech never worked well, if at all, according to a lawsuit first reported by TechCrunch this week. Idaho dealership Burks Tractor claimed Monarch sold it “defective” vehicles that experienced “significant problems” after they arrived in 2024. Primarily, Burks accused Monarch’s tractors of being “unable to operate autonomously.” (Monarch denied the claims in a court filing.) Monarch Tractor suggests to employees in the memo on Thursday it is trying to pivot even harder away from making tractors — which may not be surprising, given that the startup lost its contract manufacturer, Foxconn, earlier this year . “The new busines", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/monarch-tractor-preps-for-layoffs-and-warns-employees-it-may-shut-down/", "timestamp": 1763655834.721509}

And based on the company’s results, there may be reason to. Nvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company’s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations. The revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia’s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia’s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive. Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company’s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs. “This demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,” Kress said. Blackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company.

An “infamous mystery hacker” known as the Puppet Master is wreaking havoc on the internet, breaking into the so-called cyber-brains of several humans as well as “every terminal on the network.” As it turns out, the Puppet Master is a creation of Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In other words, the Puppet Master is what we would call today a government-backed hacker, or advanced persistent threat ( APT ). In this case, however, the “phantom” hacker goes rogue and is wanted for “stock manipulation, spying, political engineering, terrorism, and violation of cyber-brain privacy.” That is the basic premise of the Japanese anime cult classic “ Ghost in the Shell ,” which marked its 30th anniversary this week since its debut, and was based on the chapters titled “Bye Bye Clay” and “Ghost Coast” from the first volume of the eponymous manga, released in May 1989. To say that the story of the Puppet Master was ahead of its time may be an understatement. The World Wide Web, essentially what flourished from the internet as we know it today, was invented in 1989, the same year that the first volume of “Ghost in the Shell’s” manga — including the story of the Puppet Master — hit newsstands in Japan. (The World Wide Web publicly launched in 1991.) In the manga, when the Puppet Master gets caught, an official from Public Security Section 6, an agency under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explains that they had been after the hacker “for a long time,” and they “profiled his behavioral tendencies and code/tech patterns.” “As a result, we were finally able to create a special anti-puppeteer attack barrier,” the official says in the manga. At the risk of extrapolating too much from a couple of sentences, the reality is that what the official is describing is basically what cybersecurity companies, such as antivirus firms, do everyday to stop malware. Not only do they create so-called signatures based on the malware’s code, but also based on its behavior and prope", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/how-the-classic-anime-ghost-in-the-shell-predicted-the-future-of-cybersecurity-30-years-ago/", "timestamp": 1763655835.556964}

Sardain claims that Cavela solves this problem through its AI agents, software tools that perform tasks autonomously and, in this case, act as a personal procurement team. These agents can find potential suppliers in over 40 countries and negotiate product specifications and pricing. On Wednesday, Cavela announced that it raised $6.6 million in seed funding co-led by XYZ Venture Capital and Susa Ventures, with participation from Crossover Capital. Finding suppliers and negotiating pricing with them is an inherently arcane, time-consuming process, and, according to Sardain, it was impossible to automate without generative AI. “Making products involves a lot of text data, image data, diagrams, sketches, photos. This is the kind of data that didn’t play nice with technology up until AI,” Sardain said. The latest LLM and image models allow brands to upload their complete product information, including specifications, blueprints, and all other details about the item they want produced, directly into Cavela’s AI agent. Based on those particulars, the agent identifies dozens of potential manufacturers and then instantly contacts those factories via WhatsApp, email, or text to understand production capacity and lead times and to collect pricing quotes. Sardain claims the entire process is seamless, sparing brands from sending hundreds of messages back and forth. “They log in a couple of days later, and there are quotes in their i", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/cavela-lands-6-6m-to-help-brands-beat-pre-tariff-manufacturing-costs/", "timestamp": 1763655836.2999666}

Founders and investors alike are obsessed with AI, and even Neundorfer said her firm is looking at ways to use AI to make their work more efficient, such as helping to do due diligence on the market and competition. As for companies being built, she has a preference for the founders looking to create something entirely new. “Where I tend to get excited is when I see someone who is using AI to do something that isn’t 10x better. It’s actually to create a whole new experience or workflow or behavior,” she said. “That’s what we’re looking at. Less of the incremental changes and more totally new behaviors.” This is getting harder for founders because fatigue, she said, has hit as more AI ideas start to sound the same. “Where I think founders are breaking through is when they can communicate to investors why what they’re doing is really different than the other dozens of startups that are doing that and why they are the team to go after that,” she said. Whether we are in the so-called AI bubble or not, Neundorfer says a market correction is probably coming, and a lot of the companies getting windfalls of investor money now might not survive. The winners will navigate this moment building “truly category-defining companies,” capturing where the tech is going next. “Founders who can stay ahead of that curve, build at the edge of what’s possible today, and build for what’s coming,” she listed. “Founders who are able to really read the market and understand what it is their customer wants versus just building what is possible. Those are the founders that will have an advantage.” Elsewhere on the pod, she spoke about her life before venture, where she worked at YouTube and 21st Century Fox. “So much of what I did was meet with people who had great technology,” she recalled of her time at 21st Century Fox.

Suno, which allows anyone to create AI-generated songs through prompts, announced on Wednesday that it has raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix. The company offers consumer monthly subscriptions (a free tier plus $8 or $24 per month plans) and launched a version of Suno for commercial creators in September. It has now hit $200 million in annual revenue, Suno told The Wall Street Journal . It previously raised a $125 million Series B in May 2024 , led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, Matrix, and Founder Collective, at an estimated $500 million valuation. But Suno has also been the poster child for AI training lawsuits by human artists. The company is battling a suit by three major record labels — Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music Group — which alleges Suno trained on copyrighted materials scraped off the Internet without permission. Those types of suits still reside in a legal gray zone in the U.S., and most are settled, typically by a training data licensing agreement. (Last month, Universal and Udio settled their litigation in such a way.) Suno has also faced similar legal challenges by the Danish music rights organization Koda and Germany’s GEMA. GEMA, by the way, earlier this month won its suit filed in Germany against OpenAI that also challenged the legality of training on scraped copyrighted material. But given Suno’s market success, growth, and the obvious potential market for AI-generated music, its legal complications are a shoulder shrug to investors. “Type an idea, click Create, and suddenly, you’re not just imagining music — you’re", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/legally-embattled-ai-music-startup-suno-raises-at-2-45b-valuation-on-200m-revenue/", "timestamp": 1763655837.9553552}

In those heady days before ChatGPT and DALL-E , and Zoom calls, Swatch launched a fancy online platform that let you, the watch-buying public, design your own Swatch watch . Well, not exactly design. More like customize. It was called Swatch x You , and it let you tweak Swatch's standard New Gent 41 mm model by selecting one of the (surprisingly limited) pre-set designs, which you could then move, zoom and rotate to fit over the watch and strap. You could also add in a chip for NFC payments, and, as a final flourish, put a very short personal message on the case back (to a maximum of 15 characters). As you can tell, although a fun idea, this offering was never designed to be anything near approaching bespoke. From tomorrow, however, the MoonSwatch maker is taking its Swatch x You model and giving it an artificial intelligence makeover. Dubbed AI‑DADA, Swatch says this AI-powered design tool lets you create entirely unique watches starting from a blank canvas and using only your imagination as a guide to the final outcome. After logging into your Swatch account, you prompt AI‑DADA with your own idea, then, in less than two minutes, a “unique watch design comes to life.” To underline this uniqueness, each AI‑DADA watch carries a “1/1” sign on its case back. This Swatch and Bathing Ape collaboration is part of the work now in at AI-DADA dataset. And, just as with Swatch x You, it's possible to further customize the watch by choosing indexes or selecting the color of its mechanism. To save on data center power drains and rampant creativity run amuck, you're only allowed three prompts per day on AI‑DADA, something that Swatch is spinning as a “creative challenge that makes every attempt feel special.” Ultimately, what we have here, is a new version of Swatch x You that has been plugged with image-generation software supplied by OpenAI, thus letting the general public emblazon its timepieces with whatever graphics they see fit to dream up and ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/swatchs-new-openai-powered-tool-lets-you-design-your-own-watch/", "timestamp": 1763655838.8882883}

Some masks—like our top affordable pick, the Honeywell Safety DF300 N95 Flatfold ($13 for 50) —are ideal for public transportation or for use in a theater, and others—like our top overall N95 pick, IQAir's KN95/FFP ($60 for 10) —are put on during or after a wildfire. With the risk of disruption hitting mask supply chains, along with the issues of counterfeit masks, community spread of illness, a longer and more active wildfire season, climate change, and the sometimes-vanishing guidance pages on government websites, it’s important to keep your masks at the ready. Most alarming is the Trump administration’s recent gutting of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website declares, “Due to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.” This will impact compliance and safety of new and future manufactured masks.

The Austin-based company is aiming to give a digital voice to people who have lost the ability to speak due to severe motor impairment. The trial will assess the long-term safety of the Paradromics device, as well as its ability to enable synthesized speech and text communication. Paradromics is one of several companies—which include Neuralink , Synchron , Precision Neuroscience , and Cognixion —working on technology to control computers and other devices using brain waves. Known as brain-computer interfaces , or BCIs, these systems capture brain signals associated with movement intention and translate them into commands. The Paradromics study is slated to begin early next year and include two individuals. After collecting data on the first two participants for six months, the company plans to ask the FDA to expand the study to include more volunteers. “It’s reasonable to think that someone will be communicating at 60 words per minute and be able to really sustain the conversation,” says Matt Angle, Paradromics’ CEO and founder, referring to a rate achieved by previous BCI trials led by academic groups. Normal speaking speed is between 120 and 150 words per minute. BCIs for speech restoration do not read a person’s inner thoughts. Rather, they decode certain signals from the brain’s motor cortex that are generated when a person tries to move their muscles to speak. Users are asked to attempt to say sentences out loud so that the BCI learns how to recognize those brain patterns associated with speaking. “They will just try to say words, and those words will appear very quickly on a screen. They’ll press play, and the words will be read in their own voice,” Angle says.

The best protein powders are an easy boost to any of your go-to recipes, from smoothies to muffins to morning waffles. I rely on it to fill in the nutritional gaps when my meals aren’t winning any wellness awards. While the recommended daily allowance for protein is just 0.36 grams per pound of body weight , that’s the minimum to avoid deficiency, not the sweet spot for optimal health. Depending on how active you are or your dietary needs, your daily protein recommendation may increase. For more on this, check out How Much Protein Do I Need? What was once the territory of gym bros trying to bulk up has exploded into the mainstream. Protein powders are on every shelf, in every form and flavor, and for every dietary preference. Whether you’re plant-based , a picky eater, or need a quick nutrient boost, protein powder is your fast pass. But with so many options, fads, and a never-ending list of additives, it’s easy to grab the wrong one. I’ve sifted through the market to find the best of the best protein powder.

But the trick to getting rid of paper is to not worry about being perfect.", "content": "Wanting to get rid of paper in your life is easy. Following through with that promise to yourself is hard. I've been mostly paperless for close to 15 years, and the trick to it for me was to think about it the same way I think about taking care of my teeth. Staying organized is a kind of hygiene. It's almost never a one-and-done clean-up job. So think about dental hygiene . We learn to brush our teeth twice a day, floss once a day, and see a dentist every six months to catch problems before they get worse. However, if you don't follow that schedule precisely, you can still have good dental hygiene. You just have to do enough . If you do almost everything you're supposed to, but you miss two days of flossing or are a few months late scheduling your next cleaning, your teeth won't suddenly fall out. With hygiene (or any kind of maintenance), you don't have to be perfect; you just have to be good enough. Going paperless is very much like that. Here, I want to share with you the plan I used to remove most paper from my life. It should help you get started, but know in advance that you don't have to stick to it exactly every moment of every day. You can mess up. You can forget. So long as you get into the habit most of the time, you'll find yourself mostly paperless in a couple of months. Decide where to keep digitized papers. A natural choice is to save them in a cloud storage service , such as Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, etc. By saving them in a cloud storage service, you always have a backup. If you save files locally to your device, you could lose them all if your device is destroyed, lost, or stolen. Create an inbox. An inbox is nothing more than a folder where you will save newly scanned papers by default. If you are highly organized, you might have specific folders where you want to sort each paper you scan. That's great. But where will the files go when you're feeling lazy or strapped for time? By creating an inbox, you have a catch-all pla", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-go-paperless-in-9-steps/", "timestamp": 1763655840.25487}

This was my last flight after being away from home on a book tour in May. For the past two weeks, I hadn’t left my chair much, due to all the posting, podcasting, writing, and tense, nervous scrolling that releasing a book involves. But I’d moved just fine from plane to hotel to bookstore. I’d even made a point of walking to the bookstores from hotels and back, to indulge some kind of Walt Whitman–esque fantasy. But now, at the last moment, alarm bells were going off. The pain felt as if I’d taken a hard hit to my tailbone, as I’d once done after going off a jump in an inner tube and landing ass-first on hard-packed snow. But there was no incident to ascribe the pain to. It had arrived unbidden. And now it not only hurt to sit down as I faced two hours of compulsory sitting, but the pain was growing with every minute. I spent the flight lurched forward in my seat, weight shifted all the way onto one leg, rocking back and forth as much as I could without looking like I was experiencing a religious hallucination. By the time I had to stand up, it was all I could do to not cry out—as bad as the pain was sitting down, standing up sent a radical guitar solo through my coccyx. At that time, I was about four months postpartum from delivering my first baby, and had had a blissful recovery, all things considered. I had pelvic muscles of steel, thanks to over a decade of lifting heavy weights, a practice I continued until two weeks before giving birth. I had only been back to lifting for a couple of months—deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead press, here and there some rows or lat pull-downs—but everything had been going well. At first I thought maybe the pain would disappear as quickly and mysteriously as it came.

The best coffee makers of today are nothing like the stained break-room Mr. Coffee you might remember from your first office job. Drip is now, uh, drip . The new generation of drip coffee machines is not just technologically sophisticated but kinda culturally sophisticated—exercising tight control of time and temperature and even borrowing some barista techniques from third-wave café pour-over to get beautiful, gentle, aromatic extraction without the burn or bitterness. As a longtime booster for drip coffee, I'm loving this moment. Besides, filtered coffee is good for you. What's better, most of the best drip coffee machines on this list have a lower difficulty rating than your toaster oven . My top pick, the Fellow Aiden ($400) , is a powerful machine that can account for your local elevation and has special recipes for individual coffee beans—and yet WIRED reviewer Pete Cottell managed a great mug within eight minutes of unpacking the box. My favorite full-flavored single-mug device, the Ratio Four ($259) , has only a single button. So without even trying, you can sip your drip coffee at home and say, “Man, I really taste the lychee notes in this natural-process gesha.” Or just enjoy the delicious, delicious joe. After jittering myself up testing 20 drip coffee makers this year, these are my favorite fully automated immersion-brew coffee makers that make flavorful drip, pour-over coffee, or something splendidly in between.

The letters were sent following the continued adoption of age verification laws in the US and UK, which require users to upload an ID or other personal documentation to verify that they are not a minor before viewing sexually explicit content; often this requires using third-party services. Currently, 25 US states have passed some form of ID verification, each with different provisions. Pornhub has experienced an enormous dip in traffic as a result of its decision to pull out of most states that have enacted these laws. The platform was one of the few sites to comply with the new law in Louisiana but doing so caused traffic to drop by 80 percent. Similarly, since implementation of the Online Safety Act , Pornhub has lost nearly 80 percent of its UK viewership. The company argues that it’s a privacy risk to leave age verification up to third-party sites and that people will simply seek adult content on platforms that don’t comply with the laws. “We have seen an exponential surge in sea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/pornhub-is-urging-tech-giants-to-enact-device-based-age-verification/", "timestamp": 1763655840.896919}

But this infrastructure may have old, insecure configurations, and legacy tech is often no longer supported by vendors for software patches and other protections. As generative AI platforms make it easier for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities in targets' systems, the network tech company Cisco is launching an effort to raise awareness about the issue and promote improvements—both for ancient Cisco devices and products from other companies that are still in use. Dubbed “Resilient Infrastructure,” the initiative includes research and industry outreach as well as technical shifts in how Cisco manages its own legacy products. The company says that it is launching new warnings for its products that are approaching end of life, so if customers are running known insecure configurations or attempt to add them, they will receive a clear and explicit prompt when they update a device. Eventually, Cisco will go a step further to completely remove historic settings and interoperability options that are no longer considered safe. “Infrastructure globally is aging, and that creates a ton of risk,” says Anthony Grieco, Cisco’s chief security and trust officer. “The thing we’ve got to get across is this aging infrastructure wasn’t designed for today’s threat environments. And by not updating it, it's fostering opportunities for adversaries.” Research conducted for Cisco by the British advisory firm WPI Strategy looked at the prevalence and impact of end-of-life technology in the “critical national infrastructure” of five countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan.

A White House spokesperson told WIRED that “discussion about potential executive orders is speculation.” The order says that the AI Litigation Task Force will work with several White House technology advisors, including the special adviser for AI and crypto, David Sacks , to determine which states are violating federal laws detailed in the order. It points to state regulations that “require AI models to alter their truthful outputs” or compel AI developers to “report information in a manner that would violate the First Amendment or any other provision of the Constitution,” according to the draft. The order specifically cites recently enacted AI safety laws in California and Colorado that require AI developers to publish transparency reports about how they train models, among other provisions. Big Tech trade groups, including Chamber of Progress—which is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google, and OpenAI—have vigorously lobbied against these efforts, which they describe as a “patchwork” approach to AI regulation that hampers innovation. These groups are lobbying instead for a light-touch set of federal laws to guide AI progress. “If the president wants to win the AI race, the American people need to know that AI is safe and trustworthy,\" says Cody Venzke, senior policy counsel at the American", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-prepares-executive-order-challenging-state-ai-laws/", "timestamp": 1763655841.8597672}

His thesis is that AI is taking over the world, and Nvidia chips will be sorely needed to power that technological revolution underway. “All industries, across every phase of AI, across all of the diverse computing needs in a cloud, and also from cloud to enterprise to robots,” will need Nvidia’s products, Huang said. The CEO’s pep talk ultimately drew mixed reactions from Wall Street. Nvidia shares have fallen about 10 percent in recent weeks after hitting an all-time high in late October. Shares budged up about 5 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday after Nvidia reported record quarterly sales and Huang made his anti-bubble comments. But the increase was not enough to fully make up for the recent sell-off. Nvidia has enjoyed three years of booming success since OpenAI debuted ChatGPT and caused a massive surge in demand for the company’s GPUs, which are used to train and operate generative AI systems. Nvidia dominates the global market for GPUs, and its latest releases have become highly sought after, with demand far exceeding supply. On Wednesday, Nvidia executives reiterated that it has about $500 billion in unfilled orders. The company has used its newfound wealth to buy back its own shares and invest billions of dollars in AI companies, including top users and customers of its chips such as ChatGPT developer OpenAI, data center operator CoreWeave , and Elon Musk’s xAI , which develops the chatbot Grok.

Saunders worked on an amphibious six-legged prototype before he was promoted to VP of engineering in 2018. He became the CTO of Boston Dynamics in 2021. Google DeepMind has produced important robotics research for years. As interest in more advanced robotic forms like humanoids grows, its researchers are doubling down on developing AI models to control robotic hardware systems. Hassabis said he is excited about these advances. AI-powered robotics “is going to have its breakthrough moment in the next couple of years, if I was to predict,” he explained. Boston Dynamics is majority owned by the South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Company. Hyundai purchased its stake from SoftBank, which acquired the company from Google's parent company, Alphabet, in 2017. The components and expertise required to build legged robots have become more accessible in recent years.

The tech press enthusiastically reported on the device early this year. I was less optimistic, which is why it took me the better part of the year to finally free the grill from its disintegrating cardboard box—something I finally did last week. AI is notoriously bad at recipes (unless you're a glue pizza aficionado), and who needs a recipe for a burger or steak? Since the grill can't physically stop the cook and pull your meat off the grates, what's the real difference between an authoritative AI voice telling you your food is done and a temp alert from the probe? And yet, the Zelos is a great buy, especially when priced below $300 during an end-of-season sale. This Wi-Fi-enabled pellet grill has a great design and features you won't find on grills double or more its price. I have only briefly played with the Vera AI feature, which I found unhelpful. When I prompted it to give me a recipe for \"coffee rubbed ribs with tequila sauce,\" it simply added coffee to a standard rib rub recipe, and then added tequila to a standard barbecue sauce, in equal proportion to the ketchup. ( I did not prepare this recipe, but it certainly appeared to be way too much tequila.) When I used the photo-based personalized recipe recommendation tool to give me a recipe from a photo of ground meat, dill pickles, mustard, and eggs, Vera informed me that “the image content is unrelated to cooking on a wood pellet grill.” D'oh. However, the grill doesn't need AI to be a winner. If I were looking to score a great Black Friday deal on a pellet smoker or small backyard grill, the Zelos-450 would be my choice.

A growing number of experts, however, worry that the US is starting to fall behind when it comes to minting open-weight AI models that can be downloaded, adapted, and run locally. Open models from Chinese companies like Kimi, Z.ai, Alibaba , and DeepSeek are now rapidly gaining popularity among researchers and engineers worldwide, leaving the US as a laggard in an increasingly vital area of AI innovation. “The US needs open models to cement its lead at every level of the AI stack,” Nathan Lambert, founder of the ATOM (American Truly Open Models) Project , tells WIRED. The most advanced models from US companies can only be accessed through a chatbot interface or by sending queries to companies’ servers through an application programming interface, or API. OpenAI and Google have released open-weight models, but they are far less capable than the Chinese offerings, which are better suited to modification and offer more developer support. Chinese model makers also benefit from open-sourcing their models, since the best ideas and tweaks from outside researchers can be folded into future releases. Lambert, who is also a researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2), a nonprofit in Seattle, Washington, founded the ATOM project to highlight the risks associated with the US falling behind in open source. The country needs cutting-edge open models, he says, in part because relying on foreign ones could prove problematic if those models were suddenly discontinued or made closed-source. Open models also foster innovation and experimentation between startups and researchers, Lambert says. Beyond that, companies with sensitive information need open models that they can run on their own hardware. “Open models are a fundamental piece of AI research, diffusion, and innovation, and the US should play an active role", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/us-needs-open-source-ai-model-intervention-china/", "timestamp": 1763655843.4347472}

I recently watched as Memo, a new home robot from a company called Sunday Robotics, made coffee in an open-plan kitchen in Mountain View, California. Memo looks like something out of Wall-E, with a gleaming white body, two arms, a friendly cartoonish face, and a red baseball cap. Rather than using legs as a fully humanoid robot would, Memo moves around using a wheeled platform and changes its height by sliding up and down a central column atop that platform. The robot responded to a request for an espresso by rolling over to a countertop, and then using two pincerlike hands to slowly go through each step required to operate an espresso machine. It filled the porta filter with coffee grounds, tamped them down, slotted the porta filter into place and put a coffee cup below, pressed the buttons needed to start the machine, and finally retrieved the hot drink. “We want to build robots that free people from laundry, from the dishes, from all chores,” Tony Zhao, cofounder and CEO of Sunday Robotics, told me as the robot brought the coffee over to the person who requested it. Making a cup of espresso might not seem spectacular, but the feat is ridiculously hard for a robot to do in a real, messy kitchen. It requires the ability to identify different objects, figure out how to grasp them reliably, and use those objects properly. Sunday is not only building its own hardware but also training the models that allow its system to learn. “We think the way to make a home robot is to be full-stack, and to vertically integrate,” Zhao says. “And that’s a very ambitious thing to do.” Today most robots still do precise, repetitive work in tightly controlled environments; for example, moving the same item from one position to another over and over again.

You likely don’t need the multi-thousand-hertz refresh rates or the intense level of customization most of these keyboards offer, but it never hurts to have something that can outperform you. Unlike a top-of-the-line sports car, having a keyboard that’s faster than you won’t ever send you careening off the side of the road. It just means you’ll lose the excuse of “Sorry, my keyboard didn’t pick up that keypress” when you peek just a bit too far into a sniper lane and get domed. More than anything else, the main appeal of Hall effect keyboards is just how much they can do, from adjustable actuation points, rapid trigger, accidental keypress protection, and multiple inputs per key. Almost every major keyboard player now sells a Hall effect keyboard, so which model should you buy? I've been testing and deconstructing keyboards for years—mechanical, Hall effect, ergonomic, you name it—these are my favorites.

Updated November 2025: We've added the Luminkey Magger68 Plus and Sony Inzone KBD-H75, and mentioned the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 and Syntech Chronos68 as keyboards to avoid. What Is the Hall Effect? The Hall effect is a reaction between magnets and electricity. When a magnet moves closer to an electrical current in a conductor, it moves the electrons, and with this, the distance between the magnet and the conductor can be measured and reported back to your computer. The magnet sits in the switch's stem, and the Hall effect sensor is on the printed circuit board of the keyboard. Your computer can interpret this information to register a keypress once the key is at a certain distance.

That’s all changing.", "content": "For almost a decade, President Donald Trump has managed to control the conspiracy theory spin around disgraced financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . The conspiracy theories benefited him; they were one of the factors buoying him to office. It’s only been in the last few weeks—spurred by the release of new Epstein documents and the public defection of GOP lawamkers—that the complex web of misinformation has spun out of Trump’s control . It all began with QAnon. It is hard to overstate just how fringe QAnon was when Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene began posting about it in November 2017, when she posted a video praising Q as a “patriot.” The movement was led by “Q,” someone who claimed to be a government insider and who posted what they claimed was top secret intel in posts, known as “drops,” on the anonymous message board 4chan. Q laid out a wild and untrue conspiracy theory that a cabal of Democrat and Hollywood elites were behind a supposed global sex trafficking ring. Already, Jeffrey Epstein was among the key characters in the QAnon universe. Epstein was first mentioned just two weeks after QAnon began in late October 2017 and was referenced dozens of times in the almost 5,000 posts Q wrote over the following three years. Like all good conspiracy theories, this one contained a kernel of truth: The fact that Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to state prostitution solicitation charges meant QAnon supporters felt emboldened to believe every wild allegation that Q put forward . I became aware of QAnon in early 2018 but didn’t write about it until September of that year . At the time Greene started promoting it, years before she was elected to Congress, the conspiracy was in its infancy with just a handful of dedicated followers. Trump was quickly cast as the hero of this narrative, working against the “deep state” to expose these demons and bring about “the storm,” which would see the cabal unmasked and everyone from Epstein to the Cl", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-donald-trump-lost-control-of-the-epstein-spin-cycle/", "timestamp": 1763655844.0095756}

Because, you said it the first time we met, Mr. President, America welcomes the world.” Despite the heavy travel restrictions that the US government has imposed during Trump's second term, the FIFA chief estimated that between 5 and 10 million people from around the world are expected to arrive in the country. “With this FIFA Pass we can make sure that those who buy a ticket that are legitimate soccer fans, they can come attend the World Cup in the best condition, starting from getting their visa.” \"We're going to do the same vetting as anybody else would get,\" said US secretary of state Marco Rubio, who was also present at the press conference. \"The only difference here is that we're moving them up in the queue.\" In other words, having a ticket to go to the World Cup does not actually guarantee you a visa, nor does it reduce the fee to be paid. It simply reduces the waiting time for your interview with the consular officer. Rubio estimated that FIFA Pass holders could expect to wait six to eight weeks for that interview to take place. To access this privilege, you must first purchase a ticket through official channels to attend some of the 2026 World Cup matches that will be played in the United States. Then, the user must enter a FIFA portal, which will indicate the steps to follow in order to proceed with the visa application.

In other words, not only does the Q1 convert your speech to another language, it actually sounds like you’re doing the talking. That’s the idea, anyway. But before we get to all that, let’s consider the Q1’s complete feature set and how it differs from previous Vasco devices . The Vasco Translator Q1 is a stand-alone, handset-like device that mimics a tiny smartphone. Measuring about 4 x 2.5 inches in size, and less than 0.75 inch thick, it’s roughly the size of a deck of cards, though at over 5 ounces, it's a bit heavier than one. Vasco Translator Q1 Rating: 7/10 The device has no moving parts, with just a 3.5-inch touchscreen that covers its face and a few buttons on each side. These include power and volume buttons, and the now standard pair of “talk” buttons—one to recognize your partner’s voice and one for your own. In many modes, you won’t need to use these, however. Like most handheld translators, the unit includes a preloaded SIM 4G card that gives it near-global usability. (Vasco says it works “in nearly 200 countries,” which is a lot, since there are only 195 widely recognized nations today.) 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz Wi-Fi are also available when you’re in range of a hot spot or at a hotel. The 2,500-mAh battery charges via USB-C. Vasco claims that the Q1 offers “many hours of intensive use” and up to 160 hours on standby—though the battery will drain faster than you might expect even when it’s idling. “Many hours” in my testing was less than eight, but the 160-hour standby metric was roughly accurate. Language support is robust, but details vary based on how you use the device. For voice-to-voice translation, it supports 86 languages. For text-based translation, that goes up to 108. Oddly, photo-based translations work with 113 languages. Lastly, real-time call translation has suppo", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/vasco-translator-q1/", "timestamp": 1763655844.6518295}

In the first nine months of 2025, Porsche's operating profit plummeted by 99 percent compared to the same stint the year before. Yep, 99 percent. Profit has tanked for the auto brand with a track record of making billions. The reasons for Porsche's misfortune are no secret. There's the hugely expensive product strategy shift that saw the dramatic scaling back of EV plans. There was Porsche scrapping projects to build its own EV batteries in-house and instead developing new combustion and hybrid models. Plus, the double hit of US tariffs and a slump in the Chinese market have left the German automaker reeling. However, whether or not the EU decides to rewrite its EV transition timetable , the future for autos, sooner or later, will not be combustion but electric. So this means that European car companies playing the long game must still show their prowess in electrification. Which brings us to today's reveal of the final production Cayenne Electric and Cayenne Turbo Electric. The Cayenne is Porsche's first fully electric SUV. Costing $109,000 for the Cayenne, and $163,000 for the turbo version (£83,200 and £130,900 respectively in the UK), Porsche will be hoping that this, its first ever fully electric SUV, will present better long-term value for money than its formidable Taycan has, which saw unlucky owners lose half the value of the car in its first six months, pushing some into negative equity on the vehicles. This new electric SUV is the most powerful production Porsche of all time, and the specs are fittingly mighty. The Cayenne Turbo shifts from 0 to 62 mph in 2.5 seconds, from 0 to 124 mph in 7.4 seconds, and goes on to a top speed of 162 mph. A new drive system develops up to 850 kW (1,156 PS) and up to 1,500 Nm of torque when the cars' Launch Control is activated.

However, for those coming from previous generation ESWAP pads , it's unlikely to seem quite so revolutionary—in fact, it's essentially the same, bar the addition of Hall effect tech. Out of the box, the X2 H.E. looks suitably impressive, a monolith of black broken up only by the copper tones of the D-pad and triggers, subtly matched by the lettering on the face buttons and dragon \"2\" of the logo. The LED color bar of the H.E.A.R.T. is gone, making this look and feel far more mature, although the mix of matte black for fixed features and glossy removable modules does make for a degree of visual inconsistency. In the hand, it's definitely better suited to those with larger grips, thanks to a chunky overall size of 160 x 120 x 60 mm and the unusual height of the default thumbstick modules.

The 32-year-old Michigan engineer, who did not want to use his real name due to privacy concerns, first watched porn at the impressionable age of 12, but never realized he had a problem until just after his father’s funeral three years ago. “I didn't shed a single tear,” he says. “I didn't know how to react happily or sadly to anything.” That’s when his porn consumption spiraled—combined with stress, anxiety, and depression—and he locked himself in his room “all day.” The only thing that seemed palpable, he recalls, “was that rush of dopamine” delivered by an intense session of hardcore porn viewing. But for Jamie, who is Christian, those fleeting moments of porn-fueled transcendance were followed by far deeper lows, including suicidal ideations. This past March, Jamie says his partner angrily confronted him over his compulsive porn consumption, accusing him of lying and committing adultery. Jamie’s “entire world came down.” He admitted he felt that he was addicted, begged for her forgiveness, temporarily moved back in with his mother, and renounced porn. That’s when he found Relay , an app created by a pair of Mormon college students that claims it can help people “take back control from porn, one day at a time.” Jamie promised his partner he would never watch porn again—and she gave him one chance. The app provides a comprehensive plan to stop watching porn, with videos by therapists, daily journal prompts, live group sharing sessions, and a function to address serious urges.

Bland “ brain rot ” and AI -looking memes are out; Big Chungus is in. As with anything on the internet, the origin of the Great Meme Reset is hard to place. Most sources point to a March post from TikTok user @joebro909 that called for a whole new generation of memes to save the platform from the “ drought ” that had engulfed it in the spring. The post said nothing of a January 1 launch date, or a return to the memes of the last decade, but the idea was planted. Now hundreds of posts are discussing the reboot—and a return to the internet’s “dank” era. Which implies, of course, that memes lack dankness these days. If anything, Gen Z– and Gen Alpha–fueled internet culture has prided itself on somewhat meaningless content like “ 6 7 ” and absurdist, seemingly AI-generated “ Italian brain rots ,” but after nearly a year of memes with little humanity or depth, a backlash has begun. “Because of just how unrecognizable memes have become,” TikTok creator Noah Glenn Carter ( @noahglenncarter ) said in a recent video, “everyone has come to an agreement that on January 1, 2026, we are going to completely reset all memes and go back to the originals.” When I reach Carter via email, the creator seems pretty convinced the reset idea could take off, and he plans to make more videos promoting it. “The memes we have now are called ‘brain rot’ for a reason,” Carter says. “The ones 10+ [years older], most of the time, had a story behind them. Or they at least made sense.

It also removed one: Launchpad. The feature, which gave Mac users an iPhone-like grid of applications complete with support for folders, is missing from macOS 26. Now, to be fair, a lot of people didn't really use Launchpad. Many people keep their most-used applications on their dock and turn to Spotlight, or other launchers like macOS's new Apps window, to quickly access the rest. But Launchpad had a few die-hard users, many of whom are mourning the loss of the feature on social media. What are they supposed to do? The good news: There are a few decent replacements. I tried out several, and here's the one I think is best (followed by a few other suggestions). Launchie is free, available in the Mac App Store, and as of this writing doesn't have any kind of in-app purchases. It's the best Launchpad replacement I could find. Open the application and you'll see all of your apps listed in alphabetical order. You can use your arrow keys to choose an application, if you want, or you can scroll with your mouse. Launchie is a free download. It's not a perfect Launchpad replacement in one way: It's an ongoing scrolling list of applications, not a set of individual panels. But there is a crucial Launchpad feature it offers: folders. Organization gets a lot more useful when you slot things into folders. I, for example, made a folder for all of my games. You can create folders within your launch grid. There are a few settings you can tweak, such as whether the launcher should take over the full screen or open in a window.

A new investigation reveals the impact of using spying to solve a problem.", "content": "It was in physical education class when Laila Gutierrez swapped out self-harm for a new vice. The freshman from Phoenix had long struggled with depression and would cut her arms to feel something. Anything. The first drag from a friend’s vape several years ago offered the shy teenager a new way to escape. This article was copublished with The 74 , a nonprofit news outlet covering education in the US. Sign up for its newsletters here . She quit cutting but got hooked on nicotine. Her sadness got harder to carry after her uncle died, and she felt she couldn’t turn to her grieving parents for comfort. Bumming fruity vapes at school became part of her routine. “I would ask my friends who had them, ‘I’m going through a lot, can I use it?’” Gutierrez, now 18, told The 74. “Or ‘I failed my test and I feel like smoking would be better than cutting my wrists.’” It worked until she got caught. Like students across the country, Gutierrez got dragged into a nicotine-fueled war between vape manufacturers—including a company that leveraged online advertisements on the websites of Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network to hook kids on e-cigarettes —and educators, who’ve turned to digital surveillance tools and discipline to crack down on the youngest users. Gutierrez was suspended for a week after she was nabbed vaping in a crowded school bathroom during her lunch hour. An in-depth investigation by The 74 reveals how nicotine-addicted teens, who often begin vaping under social pressure or, like Gutierrez, to cope with hardship, are routinely kicked out of school instead of receiving meaningful services that could steer them away from tobacco and help them break free of their vape pens. Candid interviews with a dozen high schoolers and recent graduates from across the country reveal how vaping has become ubiquitous in schools. The battery-powered nicotine sticks are more than an addiction: They define students’ social status, friend groups, and coping strategies years before they’re 21 an", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/vaping-surveillance-school-bathrooms/", "timestamp": 1763655845.785218}

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Revenue growth still lopsided with HLS contributing ~94% of incremental revenue sequentially. Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

However, certain documents may be withheld to protect ongoing investigations and identities of victims.", "content": "Amid growing pressure from his political opponents and members of his own base, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a legislation to compel the Department of Justice to release files on the late disgraced financier J effrey Epstein . In a post on X, Trump said that the measure would help expose the truth about certain Democrats and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, who had ties with powerful figures, died of suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019. The Justice Department will release its Epstein-related material within 30 days, as required by legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and the Senate, confirmed Attorney General Pam Bondi. However, even though Trump has signed the bill, it doesn't guarantee the release of all files, as several documents may remain confidential. The Justice Department has often cited the need to protect investigations when withholding information from the public. According to Reuters, the release of files may not be comprehensive, because the legislation passed by Congress includes provision allowing the Justice Department to hold back personal information about Epstein's victims. The New York Times reported that under the legislation, the Trump administration may withhold records that identify victims or include images of child sexual abuse, or are otherwise classified. The legislation also allows records to be withheld if they would jeopardize an active federal investigation. Insiders warn that even with the president's signature, his administration could lean on procedural delays or lingering federal investigations to keep explosive details out of the public eye, reported AFP.

The drink, which costs  ₹550, has sparked online interest.", "content": "A Beijing insect museum has introduced a new coffee that uses the ground cockroach powder. It also uses dried yellow mealworms to create an unusual drink that many people find shocking. Unusual coffee trends are common in China . Some cafes add deep-fried worms to drinks while some mix fried chilli and hot pepper powder into lattes. According to Chinese doctors, yellow mealworms are rich in protein and may help improve the immune system. A museum worker says the ant-based drink tastes sour. The pitcher plant version, on the other hand, tastes like normal coffee. The roach coffee is mainly tried by curious youngsters because their parents dislike anything related to cockroaches. The shop sells over 10 cups of this unusual brew each day. “The roach coffee is mainly consumed by curious young people. Parents with children do not like it as they dislike cockroaches,” he said. Visitors say the flavour feels burnt and slightly sour, which fits the museum’s insect theme. The drink costs 45 yuan (more than ₹ 550). It is sold only inside the museum’s own cafes. “We launched this type of coffee at the end of June, and it trended on the internet recently. As an insect-themed museum, it seemed like a good idea to have drinks that match,” an employee told the Chinese media. Staff members said the idea originated in June and gained popularity online later. That encouraged more people to try it. The museum has also created drinks using pitcher plant digestive juice. It has also innovated a special ant-based brew that was offered only during Halloween, according to the South China Morning Post. All the insect ingredients come from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) shops. The museum claims they are safe for consumption, which may comfort curious customers. TCM beliefs suggest that cockroach powder can aid in improving blood circulation. This view, however, is not accepted by mainstream science.

Former presidents George W. Bush and Joe Biden will pay their respects, along with former vice presidents Kamala Harris, Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle, the news outlet stated. Trump will not attend Cheney’s funeral and was not asked to speak at the service, USA Today reported, citing a senior White House official. According to the official, the President “was not aware of anyone else on his staff going” to the invitation-only ceremony scheduled for November 20 at the Washington National Cathedral. The news outlet stated that a spokesperson for former President Bill Clinton said he will not be present due to “an unavoidable scheduling conflict.” Cheney, who died earlier this month, will receive full military honours. Trump’s absence is unsurprising, given his long-standing tensions with the Cheney family. In the last presidential race, Cheney endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, and his daughter, former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney, campaigned for Harris throughout the general election. Vice President JD Vance also made a pointed remark about Cheney’s influence in the Bush administration. During a conversation with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. last week, Kennedy reportedly remarked that Cheney “seemed to be actually running the country” during the Bush era.

Nostalgia is widespread even though 72% of respondents across these countries — including India — were born after 1975. In India, in particular, a greater proportion of people believe that life in 1975 was better than it is in 2025. When comparing life today with 1975, many Indians drew on generational memories and family narratives that portray the past as a time marked by greater harmony, simplicity, and stronger community bonds. At least 44% of Indians believe that environmental quality was better in 1975 than it is today. Recent natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, appear to have reinforced the notion that the environment has deteriorated over time. A similar trend is seen in perceptions of happiness, with 41% of Indians believing that people were happier in 1975. “Respondents pointed to greater social bonding, fewer digital distractions, more family time, and a slower pace of life. While financial resources were limited then, many believe people still lived contentedly and shared more meaningful personal interactions,” the study found.  In 2025, India was ranked 118th among 147 countries in the World Happiness Report 2025. According to the survey, more Indian citizens believe that streets were safer 50 years ago, and living standards are perceived to have been better in the past. “People also felt less threatened by war or global conflict, and healthcare was considered more accessible or affordable during that time,” the study added. In 1975, India's then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a National Emergency on the midnight of June 25–26, citing “internal disturbance.” This 21-month authoritarian period (25 June 1975 – 21 March 1977) suspended civil liberties, jailed over 100,000 opposition leaders and critics without trial, censored the pre", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/41-of-indians-believe-people-were-happier-in-1975-but-whats-better-in-2025-11763648752550.html", "timestamp": 1763655894.7035992}

The visit comes soon after UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s trade mission to India and is aimed at strengthening business links, boosting investment flows and expanding collaboration in technology, education and skills. Trade between the two countries continues to grow steadily. India’s merchandise exports to the UK rose 11.7% to $14.5 billion in FY25, while imports grew 2.3% to $8.6 billion, taking the total trade to $23.1 billion, up 8% from $21.39 billion in FY24, when exports were at $12.98 billion and imports at $8.4 billion. The landmark India-UK FTA was signed on 24 July in London during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit. It is the most comprehensive FTA signed by the UK in the Indo-Pacific region post-Brexit and adds to India’s growing portfolio of bilateral trade agreements, including those with Australia and the UAE. During her three-day itinerary, Malhotra will meet UK businesses operating in Chennai and Bengaluru—including Tesco, Revolut and BT—to understand how the FTA is supporting their operations and helping channel investment back to the UK. Calling the visit a reflection of the importance the UK places on its partnership with India, Malhotra said the revitalized relationship was already creating jobs, driving innovation and delivering investment in both the economies. Malhotra also underlined her personal connection to the visit, calling it significant for a UK minister of Indian origin.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. NEW DELHI : \n     \n      A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Thursday held that courts cannot impose timelines on the President of India or state governors to approve bills passed by state legislatures, while urging them to respond promptly. The five-judge bench led by Chief Justice B.R. Gavai said its earlier judgment, which had introduced fixed timelines and suggested that bills could be treated as automatically approved if constitutional authorities delayed action, was incorrect. Such directions, the bench said, take away powers that the Constitution gives only to the President and governors. Other judges on the Bench were Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P.S. Narasimha and Atul S. Chandurkar. The ruling is likely to influence how impasses between state governments and governors over bill approvals are resolved and opens up the possibility of delays over bills in states relating to economic, business, financial, and infrastructure domains, among others. Like, for instance, Tamil Nadu’s Online Gambling Prohibition Bill. Passed in October 2022, the bill remained in limbo for months, leaving the gaming industry in uncertainty until assent was finally granted in April 2023. Legislative delays? The ruling comes as several states are struggling with delayed assent to important laws, slowing commercial and economic reforms and creating uncertainty for industries and investors. Under Articles 200 and 201, governors and the President hold the discretion to approve or withhold assent, but long periods of inaction have stalled policies relating to online gaming, industrial land rules, power tariffs and urban development. In Punjab, multiple bills passed in 2023, including those dealing with municipal administration and electricity reforms, were held up for months, delaying tariff decisions and slowing infrastructure planning until the Supreme Court intervened.

The new format prescribed on Wednesday increases the need for disclosures on valuation risks, any conflict of interest involved and how professional judgement is used in determining the value of assets. The idea is to enhance the confidence of stakeholders in the due diligence process and to make negotiations more realistic for better outcomes. The move to standardise the valuation report comes in the context of these reports becoming the subject of litigation in some of the bankruptcy cases. A standardised format is expected to make assessments easier for creditors as well as potential investors. This is crucial because based on the assessment of the distressed enterprise’s value, creditors decide to rescue or to liquidate the company. The format mandates the necessary information and documentation, requires conflict of interest disclosure, and covers factors relevant to recoverability, such as costs and economic trends. IBBI will accept public suggestions on the format till 10 December. Yogendra Aldak, executive partner at Lakshmikumaran and Sridharan attorneys, said the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) valuation guidelines will bring consistency, transparency, and standardization, leading to reports that are well-reasoned and backed by sufficient evidence. These guidelines seeking standardization of valuation reports are likely to promote more informed and effective decision making for the resolution professionals, said Aldak.

Severe child deprivation has decreased by one-third since 2000, marking a significant milestone in global development, the UN children's agency said in its report The State of the World's Children 2025. “So far this century, countries have made progress towards reducing child poverty as measured by severe deprivation. Estimates show that poverty based on severe deprivation in at least one area has fallen by one third since 2000 in low- and middle-income countries,” the report said. However, about two in five children worldwide still faced severe deprivation, the report noted. In India, as many as 206 million children experience at least one deprivation, but fewer than one-third, or 62 million, experience two or more, according to the report. Unicef defines child deprivation as the absence of resources children need to survive, develop, and thrive, reflecting shortfalls across several essential categories like nutrition, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, education, and adequate housing. Nearly 412 million children, or one in five globally, still live in extreme monetary poverty, surviving on less than $3 a day, with the burden most acute in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the report said.  The agency highlighted five policy strategies that have helped countries sharply reduce child poverty: elevating it as a national priority; creating fiscal space that protects child-related spending; expanding inclusive social protection, such as universal and targeted cash transfers; strengthening access to quality public services; and promoting decent work and social security for caregivers. But the report cautioned that these gains are increasingly under threat with climate change , rising armed conflict, and severe funding pressures converging to create an im", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/child-poverty-unicef-severe-child-deprivation-child-poverty-india-11763635368215.html", "timestamp": 1763655896.2341888}

The Team India cricketer posted photos and videos on Instagram with his girlfriend. He also shared pics of his son, Agastya, in the same post. One clip showed Mahieka wearing a large diamond ring, which piqued fans' curiosity. Many people now believe the couple may be engaged. In the pictures, they wore matching traditional outfits and looked close. Viewers focused on the bright ring on her finger. They have begun to assume that the couple might have decided to move forward in their relationship. Hardik and Mahieka went public a few months ago about their relationship. Pandya’s followers believe this latest post hints at a significant step for them in the near future. One Reddit post earlier wondered why Hardik Pandya is suddenly posting photos of his girlfriend. The user noted that he had never posted anything like that even though he had many girlfriends in the past. “Something is different with this one as he’s constantly posting her and publicly claiming her. Either he’s actually serious about her or she’s pregnant and marriage is going to happen,” the user wrote. “Baby Agastya 2.0 on cards,” commented another user. Another posted, “I really think she is pregnant, he never posted Jasmine like that. Not even Natasa when they were dating.” The speculation may have stemmed from the fact that Natasa Stankovic was already pregnant when the Serbian actress married Hardik Pandya in 2020. They announced the pregnancy around the time of their wedding. Photos from that period showed she was visibly pregnant, which many fans noted online. Their son Agastya arrived soon after the marriage and confirmed the timeline clearly for everyone. In July 2024, they officially announced their separation: \"After four years of being together, Natasa and I have decided to mutually part ways.

Alipov made the comment in an interview with TASS. The ambassador stated that Russia is ready to continue providing the most favorable terms to New Delhi for the purchase of energy resources. “Despite the obstacles put in place by the West, we remain the largest supplier of oil to India,” the ambassador told TASS. He added that American sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil may, of course, influence the redistribution of hydrocarbon flows, but for India economic feasibility always remains a priority. “We assume that Russia will retain its status as one of the main energy suppliers to the South Asian republic, with entrepreneurs being able to adjust to the existing format of interaction given the current situation.” On October 22, the US imposed sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil — two of the largest oil producers in Russia — to cut off the Kremlin's resources for funding the Ukraine war. According to European think tank, India spent as much as 2.5 billion euro on purchases of crude oil from Moscow in October, and it was unchanged from the 2.5 billion euro spent on buying Russian oil in September.

In a notification on Thursday, Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said the US State Department has approved the sale of $93 million worth of military equipment. This is the first time New Delhi has purchased defence equipment from Washington after US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50% as punishment for the country's purchases of Russian oil. According to the DSCA statement, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions. The agency added that the “proposed sale will improve India's capability to meet current and future threats by providing precision capability equipment, which will increase first strike accuracy in its brigades. India will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” The Javelin missile system is a modern anti-tank guided missile system that is used extensively across the world. It is a single man-portable fire-and-forget medium-range anti-tank weapon system designed to defeat all known and projected threat armour.

The Javelin works with a fire-and-forget infrared seeker, which allows the operator to lock a target before it is launched.

If a raid has to be conducted, it should not be done on a pick-and-choose basis. If they have done anything wrong, action should be taken, but not just to create pressure. The Press is the fourth estate, and it should get space to practise journalism,\" Surinder Choudhary told reporters. The Kashmir Times management sharply criticised the reported raids on its Jammu office, terming the allegations of activities inimical to the state a coordinated attempt to suppress an independent media institution. The editors said Kashmir Times, founded in 1954 by Ved Bhasin, has consistently upheld independent journalism. “We have chronicled the region’s triumphs and failures with equal rigour. We have given voice to communities that would otherwise go unheard. We have asked difficult questions when others remained silent,” they said.

The latest clashes, which left at least 10 people injured, have reignited concerns over the deepening political rift between young protesters and the opposition party’s leadership. Tension flared on Thursday in Simara Chowk after Gen-Z demonstrators returned to the streets, alleging that police had failed to arrest individuals named in their complaint from the previous day’s clashes. According to The Kathmandu Post , crowds began assembling from 11 AM, well before the Bara district administration announced a curfew from 1 PM to 8 PM to prevent further escalation. However, the prohibitory order quickly unravelled. As Khabarhub reported, “However, the prohibitory order failed to take effect, with demonstrators pouring into the streets and clashing with police. Authorities fired six tear gas canisters and two rounds of aerial fire after protesters defied the curfew and continued advancing.” Protesters hurled stones at security forces, injuring six police personnel, while four Gen-Z activists were also reported injured, the news outlet added. The confrontation stems from anger over the perceived mishandling of earlier complaints and simmering hostility between Gen-Z activists and CPN-UML members. The initial clashes erupted on Wednesday when news spread that CPN-UML general secretary Shankar Pokharel and youth leader Mahesh Basnet were flying from Kathmandu to Simara to address an anti-government rally. Gen-Z protesters rushed to the airport to oppose their arrival, leading to a violent confrontation with UML cadres.

The comedian had previously been suspended following controversial remarks about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk — comments that sparked backlash from affiliates and political figures alike. Trump’s explosive post on Truth Social can be seen as a direct reaction to Jimmy Kimmel’s recent pointed mockery.

Kimmel joked, “I have been ‘following the path of Hurricane Epstein … it is a category 5,’” and raised uncomfortable questions: “What did the president know? And how old were these women when he knew it?” He further ridiculed Trump for his relationship with Congress , saying that although lawmakers passed a bill to make Epstein files public, the president might try to “bury” them anyway.

In July 2025, Robert Vadra appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in 2025, where the authorities recorded his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) in relation to the money laundering investigations, according to the agency report. While Sanjay Bhandari , who is allegedly known to Vadra, has fled to London, England in 2016, soon after the Income Tax Department conducted searches at his premises in Delhi. The news report highlighted that later Bhandari was declared as a Fugitive Economic Offender (FEO) by a Delhi trial court. However, Bhandari challenged the order before the Delhi High Court.

This summons comes after disclosures made by Mohammed Salim Sohail Shaikh, also known as Lavish, a drug supplier who was recently deported from Dubai. Lavish is linked to the massive mephedrone seizure in Sangli in March 2024, which involved a total value of ₹ 252 crore. Mohammed Salim Sohail Shaikh, also known as Lavish, is a prime suspect in the ₹ 252-crore mephedrone (MD) drug trafficking case uncovered by Mumbai Police's Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC) in March 2024. Originally from Dongri in south Mumbai, Sheikh had been living in Dubai for the past three years.  According to an Indian Express report, Lavish is said to have been a close associate of drug lord Salim Dola, overseeing the production of mephedrone in at least seven states across India. Dola was the primary suspect associated with the Dawood Ibrahim gang that operated the drug network. Together with the recently deported accused, Dola allegedly controlled the entire operation from Dubai, aided by his son, Taher; his nephew, Mustafa Kubbawala; his close aide, Salim Shaikh, also known as Lavish; and several others who remain at large, some of whom are still believed to be in the UAE.  He recruited people for the syndicate to distribute and deliver mephedrone, a potent synthetic stimulant, throughout the country, an official said, as reported by Deccan Chronicle. Earlier this year, the police successfully facilitated the deportation of Taher and his nephew, Kubbawala. The police are also tracking Salim Dola, who is believed to be hiding in Turkey, having relocated there from the UAE after the deportation of his relatives between June and July of this year, IE reported. Mohammed Salim Mohammed Suhail Shaikh has confessed to Mumbai Police that he organised rave parties across India and abroad for film and fashion celebrities as well as gangsters.

The manager, who worked at a Nifty50 firm before being let go during a restructuring exercise, said the layoff came at the worst possible time: mere weeks after he exhausted his savings on a new home. Now, the property is rented out to cover EMIs while his financial buffer rapidly disappears. “My savings are depleting really fast… I have a runway of just two months,” he wrote, adding that despite paid LinkedIn and Naukri subscriptions, his job search has yielded almost nothing. “In seven months, I have only received a few calls from consultants and just two interviews.” Even industry connections, he said, have offered little help. “At this level, options are few. I’m okay with lower pay, but I’m not even getting calls. It’s all crashing down,” he wrote. The personal toll is equally heavy: “I have a family and everyone is so stressed.” His post resonated widely, with several commenters describing a similar slowdown in hiring for mid-career roles—particularly middle management positions that are being squeezed between entry-level talent and senior leadership. One user described being in the “same boat,” blaming automated resume filtering for rejections: “Recruiters ghosting, no calls. AI filters don’t care who you are. I only got callbacks after tailoring my resume using tools.” Another advised leaning on family assets in the interim: “If money is a challenge, liquidate ancestral land or gold. That’s what they’re meant for.” A third commenter called the current IT job market “brutal” and warned that volatility may persist. “One should always have multiple income sources,” he wrote, adding that he supplements his own income by trading Nifty options. “Multiple income streams are crucial today.” Stay updated with the l", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/its-all-crashing-down-iit-graduate-laid-off-from-70-lakh-nifty50-role-jobless-for-7-months-11763629520364.html", "timestamp": 1763655897.980976}

For the first time in 100 years of Hindustan Times' history, the leading newspaper dedicated its entire front page to a single individual – a young man named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad who entered the Tamil film industry to change Indian cinema forever. It was “a tribute reserved for someone whose influence transcends cinema and becomes cultural mythology,” they said. Produced in collaboration with Amazon Prime Video , Hindustan Times turned its famous front page into “Rajinikanth Times,” a full-fledged tribute honouring the superstar's 50-year cinematic reign. The HT masthead was updated to commemorate the golden jubilee of the Thalaivar. The front page was transformed into a visual homage to Rajinikanth's five-decade journey, from Apoorva Raagangal (1975) to Jailer (2023). The newspaper also replaced its familiar seriousness of the broadsheet with a bold homage to the man whose on-screen swagger has shaped pop culture for fifty years. “50 years didn't make him a legend; he made the last 50 years legendary,” read the homage on the front page. “For a man who transcended language, geography, and generations, this front page feels less like newsprint and more like a milestone,” HT said about the tribute. The media house said that ‘Rajinikanth Times’ is more than a tribute to the actor's semicentennial — “It's history printed in ink. It’s proof that in a country where stars come and go, Rajinikanth remains eternal.” OTTplay was also a central component of Hindustan Times' initiative. The digital arm of the media house utilises an AI-powered discovery engine to offer over 30 OTT services through a single subscription, creating a virtual shrine for fans of Thalaivar.

Far from losing a valued member of their team, the firm managed to turn a difficult moment into an example of supportive leadership that went viral in next to no time. The Independent Singapore reports that Ainie Haziqah, managing partner of Nurainie Haziqah & Co., shared the story on Threads. Her frank post, written in a mix of Malay and English, struck a real chord with users online. In her post, Haziqah said a lawyer at her firm came to her to resign because she needed to take care of her child, and thus could not handle the demanding schedule of her current job. Haziqah described the lawyer as someone she personally liked, professionally admired, and found “very teachable.” Instead of immediately accepting her resignation, Haziqah took time to consider if an alternative arrangement would work. After some deliberations, she proposed a flexible plan that would accommodate both the lawyer's family needs and her firm responsibilities. The solution enabled him to work full-time from home, attend office only for monthly meetings, and continue handling court cases as usual. “After a few weeks, she said yes. And Alhamdulillah, the arrangements went on for about 4-5 months, if I’m not mistaken. We worked together so naturally, it felt like the best way,” the post read. Haziqah added, “I also offered her a little salary increment fully WFH, with self-development training.” Warm online reaction Social media users hailed Haziqah for displaying empathy and flexibility. Many commented that they wish more workplaces would have this much understanding, while others termed it a strong example of modern-day leadership.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured.
