A PhD student, who could not clear the subject knowledge test, said many aspirants from top varsities, including university toppers, have failed to secure the minimum score in the test, leaving everyone shocked. “We are not saying that the 151 who have qualified are undeserving or have not qualified on merit.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank. Also Read | IIT Delhi BTech Placement Trends: Top-packages, companies Tests vary in difficulty with each session (so scores are not the same). Two students who score differently on the same exam can have the same percentile and therefore the same rank.

Therefore, the percentile will always be viewed as the best benchmark for determining a good score on the JEE Main examination. Also Read| Is NCERT enough for preparation?

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers. But the rise of IIT Bombay was also inseparable from the city that housed it, a city whose own history of names reflects centuries of shifting rule, culture, and political imagination.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

His advice to aspirants: – Focus on strengths, avoid comparison, drink enough water, and sleep well. “CAT is not about knowing everything; it’s about knowing what you know well.” What to avoid: – No late-night study – No new topics – No scrolling through forums – Don’t freeze if the first few questions look tough “Don’t let someone else’s stress become yours.” How he attempted the paper: A quick scan, attempt the obvious ones, mark the rest, no over checking. “Move fast, trust yourself, don’t overthink.” Also Read | CAT 2025: Common mistakes aspirants make and how to avoid them Apoorva Rajadhyaksha , who scored a perfect 100 percentile i", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-what-toppers-did-in-the-last-few-days-before-test-mba-admission-iim-10384785/", "timestamp": 1764858613.0853605}

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people.

Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

The Ministry of Education had earlier this year set up a nine-member panel to examine issues relating to coaching and the emergence of “dummy schools” besides the effectiveness and fairness of entrance examinations. The panel is studying the effectiveness and fairness of competitive entrance examinations in the context of the school education system and their influence on the growth of the coaching industry. During the year, the parliamentary panel will also examine the “current practices and policies” regarding school closure.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) .

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options. ApplyBoard co-founder and CEO Meti Basiri said that the study-abroad decision “is now, more than ever, a financial calculation,” with students prioritising tangible career outcomes and policy consistency. The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The company on Wednesday said it is expanding its partnership with cloud data company Snowflake in a $200 million multi-year AI deal that will bring Anthropic’s large language models to Snowflake’s platform, and consequently, to its sizable customer base. “Anthropic joins a very select group of partners where we have nine-figure alignment, co-innovation at the product level, and a proven track record of executing together for customers worldwide,” Snowflake’s co-founder and CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, said in a blog post. “Together, the combined power of Claude and Snowflake is raising the bar for how enterprises deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.” This deal is also being positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to bring AI agents to enterprise customers. Claude Sonnet 4.5 will power Snowflake Intelligence, the cloud company’s enterprise AI service. Snowflake said its customers will be able to tap Claude models, including Claude Opus 4.5, to run multimodal data analysis.

The European Commission on Thursday said it is launching an antitrust investigation into Meta’s move to ban other AI companies from using WhatsApp’s business tools to offer their own AI chatbots to users on the app. WhatsApp in October changed its business API policy to ban general-purpose chatbots from the chat app, saying that the API isn’t designed to be a platform for the distribution of chatbots. The policy change, which goes into effect in January, would affect the availability of AI chatbots from the likes of OpenAI, Perplexity, and Poke on the app. Notably, this move doesn’t affect businesses that are using AI to serve customers on WhatsApp. For instance, a retailer running an AI-powered customer service bot won’t be barred from using the API. Only AI chatbots like ChatGPT are prohibited from being distributed via the API. In its statement, the EU’s executive arm said it was concerned that the policy may “prevent third-party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (‘EEA’).” “As a result of the new policy, competing AI providers may be blocked from reaching their customers through WhatsApp. On the other hand, Meta’s own AI service ‘Meta AI’ would remain accessible to users on the platform,” the Commission wrote. “AI markets are booming in Europe and beyond.

For 2025, the winning iPhone app was visual planner Tiimo, and the iPhone game of the year was the card game Pokémon TCG Pocket. Although Apple has continued to avoid naming a dedicated AI app or AI chatbot as its app of the year, AI was showcased among this year’s winners. Apple’s app of the year, Tiimo , for instance, is described as a visual AI planner that turns to-dos into plans with visual timelines. The app uses AI to break down your tasks into a realistic schedule by estimating how long each step of a task could take and helping you to create a plan. Meanwhile, the iPad app of the year, Detail , simplifies video editing with an “Auto Edit” AI feature that handles things like silence removal, zoom cuts, and adding titles and captions. A Cultural Impact winner, StoryGraph , uses a machine learning AI to make book recommendations based on your reading data, while another, Be My Eyes , offers an AI assistant that provides visual descriptions of real-world images for blind and low-vision users. And the Apple Watch app of the year, Strava , includes an AI assistant that turns workout data into insights. The company also announced winners for the iPad, Mac, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and a standout within its own game subscription service, Apple Arcade. Plus, Apple gave a handful of apps a “Cultural Impact” award. These apps, the company said, offered helpful tools, promoted understanding, or shaped a more inclusive world.

The firm will back AI startups and seek out India-focused startups in consumer, fintech, and digital infrastructure. AI has soaked up most of the venture capital raised globally and the 20-year-old VC firm also sees AI as a defining technological shift. But it argues crowding into a single, overheated category carries its own risks. India’s digital economy provides a counterbalance: an expanding market where AI adoption is rising and opportunities remain more diverse. For Nexus, that balance is rooted in its origins. The Delaware-headquartered firm, with offices in Menlo Park, Mumbai and Bengaluru, has operated as a single fund and an integrated U.S.–India team since its founding in 2006. It backs early-stage software and India-focused startups from the same pool of capital. Over time, its cross-border software bets have encompassed a range from infrastructure and developer tools to AI agent startups. U.S. portfolio includes companies such as Postman, Apollo, MinIO, Giga, and Firecrawl, which have become widely adopted in developer tooling and AI infrastructure. Meanwhile its India portfolio has broadened across consumer, fintech, logistics, and digital infrastructure. Some of its bets there include Zepto, Delhivery, Rapido, Turtlemint, and Infra.Market “AI is a huge inflection point, and we are anchoring on that,” Jishnu Bhattacharjee, a managing partner at Nexus Venture Partners in the U.S., told TechCrunch in an interview. “But we are also seeing that many of these AI innovations are actually getting used to serve the masses better.” Nexus manages $3.2 billion in capital across its funds and has invested in more than 130 companies over the years.

The startup raised €500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S. Formerly known as Sendinblue , Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M. The U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo’s revenue — one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That’s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth. “That’s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,” the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch. Revenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards. After joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass €200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach €1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch. That’s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and also to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured. (Brevo claims “double-digit EBITDA margin.”) These coffers have already supported Brevo’s plans to invest €50 million in AI over five years, and to use acquisitions (11 to date) as one of its growth levers.

The unsurprising theme is AI for the enterprise. This year it’s all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. “We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too.

This is a significant hire for Meta, as the company makes a push toward consumer devices like smart glasses and virtual reality headsets. Dye will focus on improving AI features in these devices and report directly to Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth. At Apple, Dye will be replaced by Steve Lemay, who has had “a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,” according to a statement Apple CEO Tim Cook gave Bloomberg. It seems that Meta is recruiting from its competitors to help the company compete in the AI race, as Meta also poached researchers from OpenAI this summer. (Allegedly, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hand-delivered homemade soup to an OpenAI employee in a recruitment push; OpenAI chief research officer Mark Chen said that he has since delivered his own soup to promising Meta recruits.) Shortly after the news broke of Dye’s departure, Zuckerberg announced a new creative studio within Reality Labs that would be led by Dye. There, he’ll be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another former Apple designer who led interface design across Reality Labs; Joshua To, who led interface design across Reality Labs; Meta’s industrial design team, led by Pete Bristol; and its metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin. Zuckerberg said the studio would “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” “Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered,” the Meta CEO wrote on Threads. “We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software.” This article was updated ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/meta-poaches-apple-design-exec-alan-dye-to-lead-new-creative-studio-in-reality-labs/", "timestamp": 1764858962.0055332}

Three years ago, the idea of a YouTuber with a $1.5 billion valuation left some onlookers incredulous — but Beast Industries ended up raising at a $5 billion valuation last year . Now we’re asking a bigger question: Would you buy stock in a 27-year-old named Jimmy? It’s getting to the point where even if you don’t have a child under the age of 15, you should know who MrBeast is. The North Carolinian Jimmy Donaldson’s MrBeast channel has over 450 million YouTube subscribers — more than any other YouTube channel — making him arguably the most successful social media star ever. So it made sense when at the DealBook Summit, reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin asked MrBeast and Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, about going public. “You want to have an IPO at some point, I imagine,” said Sorkin. “At some point, we want to be able to give the 1.4 billion unique people around the world who has watched Jimmy’s content the last 90 days a chance to be owners of the company,” Housebold replied. Sounds pretty much like a yes, as we can’t imagine another practical way to give ownership stakes to over a billion people. Like other major creators, the MrBeast business expands far beyond YouTube ad revenue and into a company called Beast Industries. Its biggest moneymaker is Feastables chocolate, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show “Beast Games,” according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg. Housenbold also mentioned that Beast Industries plans to build a two-sided marketplace for creators and marketers to work together (this idea has been explored by many creator economy startups already).

Roblox is a user-generated content platform where players can create and share their own games and experiences, similar to Minecraft. The platform hosts various interest-based and affinity communities, including military roleplaying games and LGBTQ solidarity groups. But Russia has laws designating public LGBTQ advocacy as “ extremist activity. “ According to a translation of an article in TASS , a state-owned Russian news agency, Russia’s communications agency cited the presence of LGBTQ content on the platform as one of the reasons behind the ban. Roblox did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment on the ban this afternoon. The ban comes as Roblox faces broader safety and moderation challenges. Recent reports have highlighted how the platform exposed some of its underage users to child predators. In the U.S., Roblox has faced legal probes from the attorneys general in Texas and Louisiana. Roblox has since introduced age checks and content moderation tools aimed at keeping children safe — beginning in January, the company plans to implement mandatory facial verification to access Roblox’s chat features. (However, facial verification technology comes with safety concerns of its own.) Roblox has also asked developers to flag experiences that “are primarily themed on a sensitive social, political, or religious issue” so that the parents of users under 13 years old can decide if their children can access that content. This sparked backlash from advocacy groups like Out Making Games, Women in Games, and BAME in Games, which represent minority groups in the gaming industry.

But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those who can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week. As expected, the company revealed at the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is 4x faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip. He said the Trainium2 business “has substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.” Bedrock is Amazon’s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models. Jassy said Amazon’s AI chip is winning among the company’s enormous roster of cloud customers because it “has price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.” In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those “other GPUs” out there on the market. That is, of course, Amazon’s classic MO , offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices. Additionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an interview with CRN , about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it’s Anthropic. “We’ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we’ve announced Project Rainier, where there’s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,” Garman said. Project Rainier is Amazon’s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic’s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October .

With CEOs from Ford and Stellantis in attendance, President Donald Trump proposed rolling back fleet-wide fuel economy to 34.5 miles per gallon for 2031 model-year cars. The previous fuel economy standard, set under the Biden administration, mandated fuel economy of 50.4 mpg by 2031. The regulation change also reclassifies crossovers as cars instead of light trucks, and it eliminates automakers’ ability to trade electric vehicle credits. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulates fuel economy rules under Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards. Those rules, first enacted by Congress in 1975, dictate how far vehicles must travel on a gallon of fuel. In 2024, automakers had to average 30.1 mpg across their fleets, which they beat, delivering 35.4 mpg, according to CAFE calculations. Trump also said he would authorize the Department of Transportation to allow automakers to manufacture “really small cars” like the kind found in Japan and South Korea. The White House claims that existing regulations would have caused automotive prices to increase by $1,000 per vehicle. The previous Trump administration made the same argument in 2020, when it last rolled back fuel economy standards. Since that rollback, though, the price of a new vehicle has climbed to new heights , topping $50,000 on average, as automakers discontinued low-end models to capitalize on consumers’ preferences for SUVs. Larger vehicles use more material , thus costing more to make, while also getting lower fuel economy. Consumers’ choices appear to run counter to the administration’s contention that lower fuel economies are in the car-buying public’s interests. For instance, hybrid sales are up significantly this year over last and momentum continues. Hybrid sales grew 6% in October over the previous month.

At the company’s annual “ State of the Word ” event on Tuesday in San Francisco, WordPress project co-founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg shared several examples where Telex had been used within a working WordPress shop to do things like create price comparisons, price calculators, and pull in real-time business hours plus a map link to a retail store, among other examples. Telex, which Mullenweg previously described as a “v0 or Lovable, but specifically for WordPress,” is essentially the publishing platform’s attempt to build its own vibe-coding tool for the AI era. The software allows developers to generate Gutenberg blocks — the modular bits of text, images, columns, and more — that make up a WordPress website. While the software is still labeled as an experiment, Mullenweg was able to demonstrate several real-world examples that had been built by community creator Nick Hamze. In the first example, Mullenweg showed off a pricing comparison tool built with Telex, noting that these sorts of rich, interactive web elements were something that a developer used to have to custom-build but could now be created in a few seconds. In another demo, a developer used Telex to add real-time store hours, a phone number, and a link to get directions to the header block of their WordPress site. Telex was also shown being used to create a carousel of partner logos on a business’s site, a custom pricing tool, a Google Calendar integration, and a grid for posts on a WordPress homepage, where each post’s card on the site had the same height. “Again, things that you used to have to, like, hire developers, do custom software like this would have cost thousands, tens of thousands of dollars to build, even just years ago. We’re now able to do in a browser for pennies,” said Mullenweg. “It’s kind of insane.” Another developer, Tammie Lister, used Tele", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/wordpresss-vibe-coding-experiment-telex-has-already-been-put-to-real-world-use/", "timestamp": 1764858962.7270303}

The company seeks to replace legacy software like Oracle NetSuite with its offering that can automate routine tasks and provide predictive insights. The massive funding round from top-tier VCs signaled that the startup is likely experiencing phenomenal revenue growth. However, one VC who declined to invest told TechCrunch that DualEntry’s annual recurring revenue (ARR) was just around $400,000 when he reviewed the deal in August. DualEntry’s co-founder, Santiago Nestares, denies that number. When asked about revenue when the deal closed, Nestares said it was “considerably higher than that.” Even so, an extremely handsome valuation relative to revenue is becoming an increasingly common investment strategy among top-tier VC firms. The tactic is known as “kingmaking.” This approach involves deploying massive funding into one startup in a competitive category, aiming to overwhelm rivals by granting the chosen company a bank-account advantage so significant that it creates the appearance of market dominance. Kingmaking isn’t new, but its timing has shifted dramatically. “Venture capitalists have always evaluated a set of competitors and then made a bet on who they think the winner is going to be in a category. What’s different is that it’s happening much earlier,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners. This early aggressive funding contrasts with the last investment cycle. “The 2010s version of this was just called ‘capital as a weapon,’” said David Peterson, partner at Angular Ventures. He pointed out that massive funding into Uber and Lyft was a canonical example of this, but the capital weaponization for the ride-sharing companies didn’t begin until they reached their Series C or D rounds.

Anticipating privacy fears, Kohler said on its website that the Dekoda’s sensors only see down into the toilet, and claimed that all data is secured with “end-to-end encryption.” The company’s use of the expression “ end-to-end encryption ” is, however, wrong, as security researcher Simon Fondrie-Teitler pointed out in a blog post on Tuesday. By reading Kohler’s privacy policy , it’s clear that the company is referring to the type of encryption that secures data as it travels over the internet, known as TLS encryption — the same that powers HTTPS websites. Using the right terms matters, especially in the context of users’ privacy concerns. Using the expression end-to-end encryption — widely adopted by messaging apps such as iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp — to describe TLS encryption is wrong, and can potentially confuse users who see that expression and think Kohler actually cannot see the pictures that the camera takes. A Kohler spokesperson did not respond to questions from TechCrunch, but a company “privacy contact” told Fondrie-Teitler that user data is “encrypted at rest, when it’s stored on the user’s mobile phone, toilet attachment, and on our systems.” The company also said that, “data in transit is also encrypted end-to-end, as it travels between the user’s devices and our systems, where it is decrypted and processed to provide our service.” The security researcher also pointed out that given Kohler can access customers’ data on its servers, it’s possible Kohler is using customers’ bowl pictures to train AI. Citing another response from the company representative, the researcher was told that Kohler’s “algorithms are trained on de-identified data only.” The Dekoda costs $599 plus a mandatory subscription of at least $6.99 per month.

Trump Jr. joined 1789 Capital as a partner in 2024. The firm is said to have invested in Vulcan Elements around three months ago , according to Bloomberg. In August, the company announced a $65 million Series A led by Altimeter Capital.

The concept is always the same, though: Bring together people who are working on genuinely important developments in a smaller setting, before everyone else figures out they’re important. One of our favorite moments was when, in 2019, Sam Altman told a StrictlyVC crowd that OpenAI’s monetization strategy was basically “build AGI, then ask it how to make money.” Everyone laughed.

Now he’s tackling semiconductor manufacturing’s biggest problem: Every advanced chip depends on $400 million machines that use lasers only one Dutch company knows how to make.

Details of the cyberattack emerged this week after Marquis filed data breach notices with several U.S. states confirming its August 14 incident as a ransomware attack. Texas-based Marquis is a marketing and compliance provider that allows banks and other financial institutions to collect and visualize all of their customer data in one place. The company counts more than 700 banking and credit union customers on its website. As such, Marquis has access to and stores large amounts of data belonging to consumer banking customers across the United States. At least 400,000 people are so far confirmed affected by the data breach, according to legally required disclosures filed in the states of Iowa, Maine, Texas, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire that TechCrunch has reviewed. Texas has the largest number of state residents so far who had data stolen in the breach, affecting at least 354,000 people. Marquis said in its notice with Maine’s attorney general that banking customers with the Maine State Credit Union accounted for the majority of its data breach notifications, or around one-in-nine people who are known to be affected throughout the state. The number of individuals affected by the breach is expected to rise as more data breach notifications roll in from other states. Marquis said the hackers stole customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, such as bank account, debit, and credit card numbers. Marquis said the hackers also stole customers’ Social Security numbers. According to its most recent notices, Marquis blamed the ransomware attack on hackers who exploited a vulnerability in its SonicWall firewall. The vulnerability was considered a zero-day , meaning the flaw was not known to SonicWall or its customers before it was maliciously exploited by hackers.

While DJI's continual stream of steadily improving, ever-reliable drones almost always impresses, what Antigravity has done with its first-ever product, the A1 , essentially invents an entirely novel subcategory: the 360 drone. Using the same shoot-first, frame-later technology as the Insta360 X5 (Antigravity is technically a distinct company from Insta360, but the brands have close ties ), the A1 has twin cameras to capture everything around it, allowing the user to reframe the footage later using mobile or desktop apps. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 Each of the cameras uses a 1/1.28-inch sensor and an ultrawide lens to capture a hemispherical view. In-camera software then joins the two views into a near-seamless single spherical video, completely removing the drone and its propellers from view (in much the same way Insta360's cameras remove a selfie stick). The 360-degree clips can be as high as 8K and 30 frames per second in resolution, but 5.2K and 4K options are available for users requiring 60 fps or 100 fps frame rates. When output to a standard \"flat\" video, however, the resolution is limited to 4K or 1080p. The camera performs best in bright, clear conditions, and while there's noticeable softening and motion noise in certain parts of the image, getting great-looking clips out of it isn't difficult. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 I think the output video looks very good for an aerial 360 camera, and it's clear that Insta360's know-how from making several generations of non-flying 360 cameras has been put to good use. The footage is easy to edit on both desktop and mobile apps, and although I preferred the former for its UI and the fine level of control it offers over scene trimming and image quality, I enjoyed the immediacy and AI-assisted highlight choices of the mobile app, too.

Zanskar, which uses AI to find hidden geothermal resources deep underground, says that it has identified a new commercially viable site for a potential power plant. The discovery, the company claims, is the first of its kind made by the industry in decades. The find is the culmination of years of research on how to find these resources—and points to the growing promise of geothermal energy . “When we started this company, I think the most common message we heard was that geothermal was dead—it was a history of bones, a graveyard of so many failures,” says Carl Hoiland, a cofounder of Zanskar. “To get to this point where, thanks to these new tools and these new capabilities, you can systematically find these sites and systematically derisk them—we just think this is the first full-scale signal that the tide has turned.” In theory, geothermal power is one of the simplest methods of generating renewable energy. Reservoirs of hot water underground, heated by the Earth’s core, produce steam that can then be used to power turbines at the surface, requiring no excessive mining or complex conversions of fuel. Geothermal resources are especially accessible in areas where tectonic plates meet and the Earth’s crust is thinner, making the western US a great candidate for power plants. The world’s largest developed geothermal field, in California, is built on the site of hot springs that humans have used for thousands of years; the first power plant was built there in the early 1920s . But a big part of the geothermal puzzle is actually finding these resources. It’s rare to find hot springs or vents at the surface that lead to a productive spot to put a power plant. Most geothermal systems that are hot enough to make electricity are deep underground, and there is no evidence at the surface. These are known as hidden or blind systems—and identifying where they are is surprisingly challengin", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/startup-found-hidden-source-geothermal-energy/", "timestamp": 1764858965.5340238}

This is just one of nine major meteor showers that grace skies throughout the year, and details of when they will appear in the northern hemisphere are listed below—so mark your 2026 calendar for these. You don’t need any special equipment to see a meteor shower—in fact, using devices like binoculars or telescopes actually prevents you from seeing meteors, because they travel too fast to be seen through the lenses of such equipment. All you need are your eyes, a dark sky with little to no moonlight, and a location that’s away from excess light, as moonlight and light pollution can wash out shooting stars. Note that the moon appears (rises) and disappears (sets) in the night sky at different times depending on what time zone you are in. All moonrise/moonset times in this piece are for the eastern US. You can use tools like Time and Date’s moonrise/moonset calendar or this tool from the US Naval Observatory to check the precise moonrise/moonset times in your exact location. You should allow your eyes about half an hour to adjust to the darkness. If you need to use a flashlight while outside, use one with red light instead of white to preserve your night vision. Each meteor shower is named after its radiant, or the constellation that the shower appears to come from. A meteor shower’s radiant usually needs to be above the horizon before you can see the meteors. You don’t need to look directly at the radiant to see meteors; shooting stars will be visib", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/watch-meteor-showers-2025-shooting-stars-ursids-geminids-leonids-orionids-perseids-southern-delta-aquariids-lyrids-quadrantids/", "timestamp": 1764858965.8639576}

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism . According to the documents, LDWF signed a memorandum of agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in May, which gives the wildlife agency the authority to detain people suspected of immigration violations and to transfer them into ICE custody. Since then, at least six men entered ICE custody after coming into contact with or being detained by LDWF officers. None of the men were issued criminal charges at the time they came into contact with LDWF officers, the documents show. Two of the men were known by ICE to have been in the country legally at the time the agency took them into custody. The documents also indicate that at least one “joint patrol” took place in a Louisiana wildlife management area in which LDWF agents were accompanied by officers with Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard. The memorandum of agreement between ICE and LDWF makes no mention of CBP or the possibility of working with the agency as part of the agreement. However, the documents indicate that a relationship with CBP may have been facilitated through LDWF’s partnership with ICE. LDWF partnered with ICE under the agency’s 287(g) program, named after the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that enables officers and employees at the state or local level to perform some of the functions of US immigration officers, such as investigating, apprehending, detaining, or transporting people suspected of violating immigration law.

This EV represents the single biggest financial investment in BMW’s history—and considering the parlous state of the Western auto industry right now, it had better pay off for the storied German automaker. The iX3 is the first of six cars based on BMW’s much-trailed new modular EV platform, the “ Neue Klasse ,” that arrives with new motors, new inverters, new batteries, new charging tech, new interior display wizardry, and, perhaps most importantly, a fancy new central computer brain designed to make these latest electric Beemers drive better than anything on the road right now. The Neue Klasse range uses the sixth generation of BMW eDrive tech, boasting “ cell-to-pack ” batteries with liquid-cooled cylindrical cells consisting of higher nickel and less cobalt content for a 20-percent bump in energy density. A lighter 800-volt electric architecture boosts charging speeds by a third, and at up to 400 kilowatts. This means 200 miles can be added in just 10 minutes in ideal conditions.

Digital rights advocates are pushing back against legislation they say will make the internet less safe.", "content": "Members of Congress considered 19 online safety bills Tuesday that may soon have a major impact on the future of the internet as age-verification laws have spread to half of the US and around the world . In response, digital and human rights organization Fight for the Future is hosting a week of events —across Reddit , LinkedIn, and various livestreams —to raise awareness of how it believes these bills are setting a dangerous precedent by making the internet more exploitative rather than safer. Many of the proposed bills include a clause for ID or age verification, which forces people to upload an ID, allow a face scan, or otherwise authenticate that they are not a minor before viewing adult content. Fight for the Future says the policies will lead to increased censorship and surveillance. Among the 19 bills considered at the hearing conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed with sweeping bipartisan approval in the Senate last year, and the Reducing Exploitative Social Media Exposure for Teens Act , which would ban tech companies from allowing minors under the age of 16 on their platforms. In addition to age verification, the bills raised concerns over issues of parental controls, consumer research of minors, AI, and data privacy. “We’re seeing this huge wave toward ID checks being the norm in tech policy, and it felt like we needed to capture the already activated communities who are not feeling heard in Congress,” says Sarah Philips, a campaigner with Fight for the Future. “If you look on YouTube, if you see people making content about KOSA or responding to a lot of this legislation, it’s very unpopular with people. But it’s viewed on the Hill as very common-sense.” Missouri’s age-gate law took effect earlier this week, meaning 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

This could have implications far outside gaming.", "content": "The video game Valorant , a fast-paced team-based shooter , has recently become a testing ground for a promising new direction in artificial intelligence research. The game’s developers at Riot Games (a Tencent subsidiary) are using 3D-native AI models to prototype new characters, scenes, and storylines, according to a researcher familiar with the company’s efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. While many AI models can generate text, images, and video, Tencent’s Hunyuan (混元 or “first mix”) family of models can dream up 3D objects and interactive scenes. The source says that Tencent’s models are also being used by the developers of another Tencent game, GKART , and by some independent developers, too. Tencent declined to comment. “The games industry requires a lot of investment,” the source says. “Previously you would need a month to design a character. Now you can just type in some text, and Hunyuan can give you four choices in 60 seconds.” The news is an early signal that models capable of understanding and re-creating the physical world could become a standard ingredient in game design. In addition to generating game content, these models could also enable more advanced virtual and augmented reality and help robots learn to do new things. “There’s a real explosion of 3D vision research nowadays,” says Alexander Raistrick , a graduate student at Princeton University working on novel approaches to generating 3D content. “There are many killer applications: There's content creation, there’s self driving, and there’s a whole stack of problems involved in augmented reality.” Raistrick adds that video games are an obvious application for 3D AI models. “Outputting 3D meshes [a standard way of representing 3D objects] is your typical kind of bread and butter of game development,” he says.

Here's How and When to View It", "summary": "The best opportunity to view this spectacle will be shortly after sunset on December 4.", "content": "A cold supermoon is on its way. On December 4, Earth's satellite will delight us with one of the last astronomical spectacles of 2025. Not only will it be the last full moon of the year, but it's also a cold moon—which refers to the frigid temperatures typical of this time of year—and, finally, a supermoon . Here's how and when best to enjoy this spectacle of the year-end sky. The term supermoon refers to a full moon that occurs when our satellite is at perigee, the point at which its orbit brings it closest to our planet. (The moon's orbit is elliptical, and its distance from Earth varies between about 407,000 km at apogee, the point of maximum distance, and about 380,000 at perigee.) In addition to being the third consecutive supermoon of the year, as reported by EarthSky , it will be about 357,000 km away from us, making it the second-closest full Moon of the year. Consequently it will also be the second-largest and brightest. Although most of us won't notice any difference in size compared to a normal full moon (it appears up to 8 percent larger to us), its brightness could exceed that of an ordinary full Moon by 16 percent. This time, moreover, it will be 100 percent illuminated just 12 hours after its perigee. In addition to its name, which refers to the cold temperatures of this period, December's full moon will be the last of 12 full moons in 2025 and the highest of the year. With the winter solstice approaching on December 21, the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, so the full moon is at its highest point. In other words, this means that the super cold moon will be particularly high in the sky. As EarthSky points out, however, it is not the closest full Moon to the December 21 solstice. While it occurs 17 days before, the first full moon of 2026 will occer on January 3—just 12 days ater teh solstice. That will be the fourth and last consecutive supermoon.

It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims. Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure.

These testers have made pilgrimages to Fortell’s headquarters on the fifth floor of a WeWork facility in New York City’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, where they were fitted for the hearing aids—which from the outside look pretty much like standard, over-the-ear, teardrop-shaped devices. But the big moment comes when a Fortell staffer takes them down to street level. There, among street clatter, honking cabs, and delivery trucks backing up to luxury stores, they are asked to conduct a conversation with a Fortell worker.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

The missile didn’t even make it 4,000 feet. Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva. The crash was accompanied by a fireball and a noxious reddish-brown cloud, the telltale sign of a toxic mix of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide used to fuel Russia’s most powerful ICBMs. Satellite images taken since Friday show a crater and burn scar near the missile silo. Analysts say the circumstances of the launch suggest it was likely a test of Russia’s RS-28 Sarmat missile, a weapon designed to reach targets more than 11,000 miles (18,000 kilometers) away, making it the world’s longest-range missile. The Sarmat missile is Russia’s next-generation heavy-duty ICBM, capable of carrying a payload of up to 10 large nuclear warheads, a combination of warheads and countermeasures, or hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies . Simply put, the Sarmat is a doomsday weapon designed for use in an all-out nuclear war between Russia and the United States.

But the stunt could reduce stigma around psychedelics.", "content": "“Come watch me trip balls,” declared Bryan Johnson , the “Don’t Die” longevity entrepreneur, on X a couple of days before he livestreamed himself consuming a high dose of psychedelic mushrooms at a psilocybin center in Oregon on Sunday . It marked the second act of his stunty new investigation into whether using psilocybin can improve almost 250 wellness biomarkers , including various measures of brain connectivity, cortisol levels, and testosterone. “There’s a potential for psychedelics to play a more important role in all of our lives, and wouldn’t it be amazing if it was also a longevity therapy,” Johnson proclaimed on the stream. Prior to consuming the shrooms Sunday—which has been legal at licensed facilities in Oregon since 2023—Johnson measured his brain activity with a $50,000 helmet produced by Kernel, a neuroimaging company founded by the 48-year-old. He also took saliva samples and temperature readings. (After his November 9 trip, he shared a lot of information about the state of his erections, but more on that later.) Then he drank more than five grams of powdered mushrooms mixed with lemon juice, for extra potency. Johnson grimaced, and a bizarre new era of live celebrity psychedelic exhibitionism was born—one that is arguably counter to the introspective nature of the drug. The five-and-a-half-hour livestream, which has been viewed more than 1.1 million times, also featured Johnson’s 20-year-old son Talmage, whose blood he has injected in his efforts to stay young, journalist Ashlee Vance, a DJ set from Grimes, and Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff. YouTuber MrBeast, while pictured on a cartoonish poster advertising the event, did not show up, which most extremely high people would probably count as a blessing. Observers noted that livestreaming an intense psychedelic trip might not be beneficial, since it can lead to fragmented attention and performance stress.

Not only would the streamer be adding Mad Men —a show that HBO execs infamously passed on back when Matthew Weiner was a writer on The Sopranos —but it would be presenting the period drama’s episodes in a new 4K remastering. This would, according to the press release , give “audiences and longtime Mad Men fans the opportunity to enjoy the series’ authentically crafted elements with crisp detail and enhanced visual clarity.” As it turned out, there was perhaps too much clarity. Not long after the series went live on HBO Max, a screencap began floating around social media from a scene in the Season One episode “Red in the Face,” where Roger Sterling is vomiting in front of a group of horrified Sterling Cooper clients. When it aired—and in the version still available on AMC+—seven men are onscreen, all of them wearing period-appropriate suits and ties. The HBO Max version, on the other hand, features two men who appear very out of place in 1960: crew members lurking in the background, feeding a hose to create the illusion that actor John Slattery is puking: As of this morning, some episodes were also mislabeled, so you had to click on the episode labeled “Babylon” to see Roger’s stomach-churning display. It’s the kind of moment for which Mad Men ’s own “Not great, Bob!” meme was invented. This is, unfortunately, not the first time this has happened when a classic series has changed platforms and/or formats. Most shows that originated in the 20th century were filmed in standard definition, in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio. Putting the images into a higher resolution, and then reframing them for widescreen television, has created similar problems.

If you’re in Manhattan’s upscale Tribeca neighborhood, that price changes to $2.29. It’s unclear why the prices differ, but a new notice on Target’s website offers a potential hint: “This price was set by an algorithm using your personal data.” A recently enacted New York State law requires businesses that algorithmically set prices using customers’ personal data to disclose that. According to the law, personal data includes any data that can be “linked or reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with a specific consumer or device.” The law doesn’t require businesses to explicitly state what information about a person or device is being used or how each piece of information affects the final price a customer sees. The law includes a carve-out for the use of location data strictly to calculate cab or rideshare fares based on mileage and trip duration but not for other purposes. The law also requires that the disclosure is “clear and conspicuous.” Target’s disclosure is not the easiest to find–a customer would have to know to click the “i” icon next to the price of an item, then scroll to the bottom of the pop-up. In the past, the courts have held that it’s not always reasonable to assume that a customer will click on “more information” links when it’s not required. Target didn’t respond to questions about the price differences or explain what personal data was used per the disclosures. For years, Target has had a practice of setting different prices for different locations. In 2021, the Huffington Post found that Target’s website changed prices depending on the store location associated with a user, and a spokesperson for the company told reporters at the time that its online prices “reflect the local market.” In 2022, the company settled a lawsuit filed by multiple California county district attorneys that alleged it used geofencing to autom", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/algorithmic-pricing-eggs-ny-law/", "timestamp": 1764858973.5019925}

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says. One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit , which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform’s rules.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment. So if you checked the news and felt even slightly infuriated this morning, keep reading. It helps to be reminded that not all billionaires are created equal—and that some of them are still pushing for more equality overall. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. KATIE DRUMMOND: Melinda French Gates, welcome to The Big Interview . Thank you so much for being here. MELINDA FRENCH GATES: Thanks for having me, Katie. So we always start these conversations with some rapid-fire questions. It's a warmup. Get your brain working, get your muscles working. Are you ready? I am ready. OK, first thing you do when you wake up in the morning. Get my coffee.

Which means these phones are—right now—already capable of running a full, fluid desktop experience. From a performance standpoint, that shouldn’t be surprising. At Apple’s September 2025 event , the company claimed the A19 Pro chip inside the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro offers “MacBook Pro levels of compute.” And that iPhone chip is reportedly destined to power a cheaper MacBook in 2026 . The line between Apple’s hardware is being further blurred, then—but what’s wild is that the software side of things has blurred completely too. It’s just that nobody realized. For years, Apple has insisted that iOS and iPadOS are distinct, despite sharing code and habitually borrowing each other’s features. But a self-proclaimed “tech geek” on Reddit who got iPad features running on an iPhone claimed they’re not merely similar—they’re essentially the same: “Turns out iOS has all the iPadOS code (and vice versa; you can for instance enable Dynamic Island on iPad).” TechExpert2910 revealed on Reddit that his hacked iPhone ran iPad OS “incredibly well,” making his 17 Pro Max an “insane pocket computer” with more RAM than his M4 iPad Pro. The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support. All without Apple Silicon breaking a sweat. The exploit is already patched in the iOS 26.2 beta, and the Redditor accused Apple of locking out iPhone users and artificially limiting older devices to push upgrades. But are things really that simple? ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/your-iphone-already-has-iphone-fold-software-but-apple-wont-let-you-use-it/", "timestamp": 1764858974.5992699}

On Instagram, Choi described his work as ongoing, announcing that he was returning to the underground Pennsylvania mine where federal retirement claims are processed. “Like Jigga [Jay-Z] I showed them the blueprint back in April, now going back in the Mine to lead the pilots next week,” wrote Choi, who previously worked as an engineer at AirBnb and has referred to Canada as home in other Instagram posts. Choi did not respond to a request for comment. It’s not just Choi. Many of the original young and inexperienced DOGE technologists whose identities were first reported by WIRED appear to still be enmeshed in federal agencies. Edward “Big Balls” Coristine , Gavin Kliger , Marko Elez , Akash Bobba , and Ethan Shaotran all still claim to be affiliated with DOGE or the US government. So do other tech workers from Silicon Valley and Musk companies like xAI and SpaceX. Coristine, Kliger, Elez, Bobba, and Shaotran did not respond to requests for comment. The DOGE ethos—characterized by cutting contracts and government workers , consolidating data across agencies , and importing private sector practices —remains fully in force. While several media reports have suggested that DOGE has all but fizzled out, DOGE affiliates are scattered across the federal government working as developers, designers, and even leading agencies in powerful roles. “That’s absolutely false,” one USDA source says of reporting that DOGE has disbanded. “They are in fact burrowed into the agencies like ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-doge-doing-now/", "timestamp": 1764858974.9406073}

Well, Vitamix crushes the blender game, but usually comes with a price tag to match. Luckily Vitamix promo codes crop up at various points during the year, and we’re here to help you stay up to date on those discounts. Vitmix’s top-of-the-line blender model, Ascent X5 , is now constructed with a stainless steel container. The 48-ounce stainless steel container is not only huge and hygienic, the machine itself combines an intuitive touch interface with a refined, timeless design. The non-reactive stainless steel material resists stains, odors, and corrosion, and expertly handles hot, cold, and acidic ingredients. This futuristic gadget also has an automatic self-cleaning program and ten blending programs for popular items like smoothies, soups, frozen cocktails and more for a precise blend, every time. Vitamix has tons of ways to save on these handy kitchen gear items, including $25 off when you register your email. All you have to do is input your email on Vitamix’s website, and you’ll get a discount of up to $25 sent straight to your inbox. Plus, you’ll get free shipping on orders of $100 or more. Glad you asked. Vitamix is offering free standard shipping for orders above $99. This pretty much means that ground shipping is free for blenders at the current discounts. Priority shipping is not free, however. WIRED has long been singing the praises of the classic Vitamix 5200.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro.

I just came across this excellent sale on Vego's kitchen composter, crowned Fastest Breakdown in our guide to the Best Kitchen Composters and Food Recyclers . These kinds of machines are almost never available for under $300, but the Vego is just $289 for Cyber Monday. Further, most of Vego's gardening and composting supplies are on discount on Amazon and the brand's website , so this is a perfect time to take a look for either yourself or a giftee. Vego Amazon Vego Note that even though the Vego is called a composter, it doesn't actually make compost; it just grinds and dries your food scraps. However, it will reduce the volume of your kitchen waste by up to 90 percent, and the resulting odor-free “Vego meal” (seen below, from Express Mode) can be used to top dress your lawn, can be mixed with potting soil as a nutritional amendment, or can just be put back in your trash (albeit with much more room). My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours. Vego is perhaps best known for its wide range of gardening gear and supplies. We haven't tested any of the below items—I might for my Gifts for Plant Lovers guide—but here are some other sales on interesting Vego items that might be worth checking out: • Raised Garden Bed Kit for $153 ($27 off) : OK, I might actually buy this myself.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers. Casting to a TV will still work in a few cases. It doesn’t work at all on the cheaper ad-supported tiers that Netflix offers. But even if you pay for the more expensive streaming tier, casting from your phone will only work if you are casting to an older de", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-wont-let-you-cast-shows-from-your-phone-to-your-tv-anymore/", "timestamp": 1764858978.5436945}

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now. The specific configuration is what makes this deal even more special though. Amazon's actually selling the more powerful model with the Snapdragon X Elite chip for less money than the X Plus model. Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work. The MacBook Air for $750 is close, yes, but features like the high refresh rate make the Surface Laptop stand out even more.

Make sure to check out the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals , and all the rest of our deals coverage for the best discounts on our favorite gear. Updated December 1: We've updated pricing on these deals, and added two new deals for the LG S95TR and Sony Bravia Theater Quad. Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room. Sony Amazon B&H An upgraded pick for the discerning ear, the Sony Bravia Theater System 6 is marked down by 25% on Amazon for Cyber Monday . This 5.1 surround system is helmed by an impressive soundbar in a surprisingly compact package, assisted by a chunky subwoofer and two surround speakers. While it lacks upfiring speakers, it makes up for it with excellent detail and smooth transitions around the system. If you crave real surround with physical speakers to compliment your soundbar, this is a great pick. JBL Amazon Walmart JBL Another option with an included subwoofer that's a little more budget-friendly, the JBL Bar 500MK2 boasts a big, bassy subwoofer that helps round out the physical limitations most soundbars fight against.

Best Cyber Monday Tech Deals (2025) Explore the story The devil's in the details with different bundles being offered by different retailers, which makes it confusing. This one offered by Amazon , for example, is a Gorilla Tag bundle, which is currently the most popular game on the platform. It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played. For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR. Meanwhile, Best Buy is offering a bundle with the game The Walking Dead: Sinners & Saints for the same price of $249. That's a $20 game. But it also comes with a $50 Best Buy e-gift card.

We've also found the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals and deals under $100 , if you need to scoop a last-minute holiday gift. Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them.

Small human studies suggest honey, ginger, and certain herbs may reduce cough frequency. These options comfort symptoms while the body heals. Avoid honey in infants younger than 1 year because of botulism risk.​ Why it helps: Honey can reduce nighttime cough in children older than 1 year and adults. Ginger contains compounds that may relax airway muscles and ease irritation.​ How to make: Simmer sliced ginger 10 minutes. Strain. Stir in 1 teaspoon honey when warm. Why it helps: Curcumin in turmeric has anti inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may support irritated airways. Evidence is early, so treat this as supportive care.​ How to make: Warm milk. Whisk 1/2 teaspoon turmeric and a pinch of black pepper. Sweeten lightly if needed. Why it helps: Clinical studies of thyme combinations report fewer coughing fits and better cough scores than placebo, suggesting expectorant effects that help move mucus.​ How to make: Steep 1 to 2 teaspoons dried thyme in hot water for 5 to 7 minutes.

Eat these 30 to 60 minutes before bed. Avoid heavy, greasy, or spicy meals that spike temperature too high. Stick to portion sizes Milk proteins generate body heat through thermogenesis. Add cinnamon or nutmeg to boost warmth and aid digestion. The ritual of sipping warm liquid signals your brain to relax, making sleep onset quicker and deeper. Calcium and magnesium ease muscle tension. Nuts deliver protein, healthy fats, and magnesium—all essential for thermoregulation. A small handful before bed sustains overnight warmth without disrupting sleep. Their fat content slows digestion, maintaining stable body temperature throughout the night. Bananas contain magnesium and B vitamins that activate heat-generating mechanisms in your body. Paired with almond butter's protein, this combo triggers thermogenesis while tryptophan (from both foods) converts to serotonin and melatonin, deepening REM sleep cycles. Lean protein is your warmth engine. Hot broth delivers amino acids that activate metabolism, generating sustained body heat. The warmth itself relaxes muscles and signals sleep onset. Minerals in broth support electrolyte balance overnight. Complex carbs require more energy to digest, triggering thermogenesis. Oatmeal's beta-glucan boosts metabolic heat while stabilizing blood sugar. Honey aids tryptophan absorption, promoting melatonin production for unbroken sleep and body warmth regulation. Both spices intensify thermogenesis through their bioactive compounds. Ginger stimulates digestion and blood flow, raising core temperature. Turmeric's anti-inflammatory action reduces sleep disruptions.

Placing fierce forms next to gentle deities can feel discordant in a household altar.

Keep one Shivlinga and worship daily with jal and bilva as per vidhi.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x. We upgrade CUBK to ADD (from Hold) with a revised target price of INR 170 (vs INR 150), valuing the stock at 1.25x FY26E (prior 1.1x).

We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive.

Over 300 domestic and international flights have been cancelled in the last two days.

The integration of Gemini AI into daily search experiences and new product announcements such as Nano Banana , the AI application's 2.5 Flash Image model sparked curiosity among people.

Expressing his views on the matter, the Deputy CM said that it is a government policy that will be implemented to ensure equality for the female workforce in the state. Last month, the state's Labour Department issued an order mandating one day of paid menstrual leave per month to all women aged 18–52 working in permanent, contractual and outsourced jobs. As per the order, the women employees have to use the menstrual leave in that very month and cannot \"carry\" it over to the next month. However, the Bangalore Hotels Association (BHA) has filed a petition in the Karnataka High Court challenging the state government’s directive. When asked about some organisations opposing mandatory leave, Shivakumar said, \"It is a government policy. We have to do equality; I don't feel we should differentiate between men and women.\" In the petition, the BHA has questioned the very basis of the order. The BHA’s petition argued that leave policies fall within the internal administrative domain of individual organisations. It further termed the order \"discriminatory\" and pointed out that the state, despite being one of the largest employers of women, has not implemented a similar provision for its own workforce, reported PTI.

The chief minister made the comment while addressing an anti-SIR rally in Murshidabad district. “I will not allow NRC or detention camps in Bengal . Even if they slit my throat, no one will be driven out,” reported PTI, quoting Banerjee. The Trinamool Congress chief also claimed that half of those who died in SIR -related incidents were Hindus. “The BJP is indulging in religious politics over SIR. More than half of those who died in SIR-related incidents were Hindus. Don’t cut the very branch you are sitting on,” she said. On Wednesday, to ensure fair and accurate final electoral rolls, Banerjee urged the Election Commission to deploy central government employees as micro-observers to complete the SIR exercise in the state. During the anti-SIR rally, the CM also stated that Waqf properties would be protected, adding that Bengal would remain a ‘safe and inclusive’ state. “Waqf properties will not be encroached upon; the safety of minorities is my responsibility.\" Banerjee alleged that for the past few days, some miscreants have been spreading rumours that the state government has recorded religious sites as mosques or graveyards under Collector Khatian No. 1. This is a lie,” she said. Reacting to Banerjee's remark, BJP MP Samik Bhattacharyya alleged that leaders and ministers from the CM's party have grabbed the most Waqf properties. “In Kardea police station, two large multi-storey buildings have come up right in front of it.

Here's what we know about the crackdown.", "content": "Russia has imposed a series of new restrictions on Apple's FaceTime app, one of the country's most widely used video-calling facilities, after government authorities previously restricted WhatsApp and Telegram call services, Reuters reported on Thursday, 4 November 2025. According to the report, Russia's federal executive agency Roskomnadzor has introduced restrictions on using Apple's FaceTime app in the country. This comes at a time when Apple is already facing a potential $38 billion penalty threat from the antitrust regulators in India for alleged abuse of market dominance in its in-app payment system and pay commissions. Apple has filed a petition against the Competition Commission of India (CCI) at the Delhi High Court, challenging their recent amendments to the Competition Act, which will now allow penalties based on the company's global turnover. If the court rules against Apple, these amended norms will potentially attract penalties of nearly $38 billion based on the overall turnover of the tech giant. As per CompanyMarketCap data, Apple's revenues stood at $395.76 billion for the year ended 2024. In the latest court hearing on Monday, 1 December 2025, the court issued a notice to the Union government and CCI ordering them to file an affidavit within a week explaining the reasons behind imposing penalties based on Apple's global turnover rather than its India revenues. As Apple now faces a nearly $38 billion penalty threat, let's take a look at how the Indian antitrust regulator has calculated the fine for the US-based tech giant. The iPhone maker has challenged the 2023 amendment of Section 27(b) in the Competition Act and the 2024 Monetary Penalty Guidelines at the Delhi High Court. According to the amended laws, the antitrust watchdog, CCI, can fine up to 10% of the company's average global turnover of the past three financial years, which, in this case of Apple will have to pay the billion-dollar penalty to the Indian regulators.

Here’s what triggered the crisis.", "content": "IndiGo, the country's largest airline, remained engulfed in operational turmoil on Thursday as more than 180 flights were cancelled nationwide for a third consecutive day. While the airline attributed the cascading disruption to stricter government rules on pilot fatigue, weather conditions and technical glitches, the chief of India’s top pilot union has reportedly alleged that the crisis is partly “artificially created” by airlines to pressure the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). By Thursday morning, at least 180 flights had been cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded at major airports including New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru. On Wednesday, the cancellations were estimated at over 150 flights. The widening disruption comes just weeks after India implemented updated flight duty time limitation (FDTL) rules designed to improve pilot rest and safety. The Federation of Indian Pilots (FIP) said IndiGo failed to recalibrate its roster adequately before the new norms took effect on 1 November, according to an ANI news agency report. The updated rules expand mandatory rest periods and introduce tighter limits on night operations. IndiGo has acknowledged the regulatory change as a factor, saying only that “stricter flight duty time limits” had contributed to the cancellations. Shares of InterGlobe Aviation, IndiGo’s parent company, fell 3.4% during the day and are down 6% for the week. Speaking to news agency PTI , Airline Pilots’ Association of India (ALPA India) President Sam Thomas accused airlines — and IndiGo in particular — of resorting to deliberate operational slowdowns to resist regulatory tightening. “I wouldn't put this as unprecedented. It happens from time to time, particularly with mostly IndiGo Airlines ,” he told PTI, adding that ALPA has repeatedly cautioned the DGCA.

Questioning the basis of the order, it had alleged that the state itself has not extended such leave to women working in government departments. Terming the order discriminatory, it highlighted that the state had not implemented a similar provision for its own workforce, despite being one of the largest employers of women.

Babu was behind bars for more than five years and had sought bail on the grounds of prolonged incarceration without trial. A division bench of Justices A S Gadkari and Ranjit Sinha Bhosale granted bail to Babu, though the detailed order is not yet available. The High Court declined the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) request to stay the bail so it could file an appeal in the Supreme Court. Babu’s counsel, Yug Mohit Chaudhary, had also contended that charges had not yet been framed and that their discharge application was still pending before the trial court. The NIA has accused Hany Babu of acting as a co-conspirator in promoting Maoist activities and ideology under the direction of leaders of the banned CPI (Maoist) group. Babu was arrested in July 2020 in connection with the case and had been lodged at Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai . The case concerns alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad event held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which police claim incited violence the following day near the Koregaon Bhima war memorial on the outskirts of the city. The violence resulted in one death and multiple injuries. The case, in which more than a dozen activists and academics were named as accused, was taken over by NIA after Pune Police initially investigated it. Meanwhile, last month, a special NIA court granted interim bail to Sagar Gorkhe , accused in the Elgar-Parishad Maoist link case, so he can appear for his law degree examinations, the report noted. Gorkhe, associated with the Kabir Kala Manch, an alleged front organization of the banned CPI (Maoist), was arrested in September 2020 and is currently held at Taloja Jail in nearby Navi Mumbai.

Check flight status for Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata.", "content": "IndiGo, India’s largest airline, was plunged into deeper chaos on Thursday after new pilot rest-period norms crippled its rostering system, forcing the cancellation of over 180 flights from major airports across the country. The cascading delays — now entering their third day — have stranded thousands of passengers across major airports and triggered renewed scrutiny of the airline’s planning and preparedness. The turmoil stems from stringent flight duty time limitations (FDTL) introduced by India’s aviation regulator to combat pilot fatigue. IndiGo has acknowledged that these updated safety norms have had a significant impact on operations, saying earlier this week that cancellations were driven by “various factors including stricter flight duty time limits.” The Federation of Indian Pilots sharply criticised the airline’s preparedness, noting that IndiGo “was not able to make timely roster adjustments and plan its schedule properly” ahead of the 1 November implementation of new rules mandating longer rest periods and tighter limits on night flying.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming.

This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable.

Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential.
