IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance.

Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

Indian students weigh options amid growing uncertainty", "summary": "", "content": "–Ankit Mehra For decades, the United States has been considered the world’s most desirable higher education destination, especially in STEM fields.

Anti-immigration rhetoric, policy ambiguity, slowing entry-level hiring, and cost pressures have pushed students and parents to question if this is the right decision. Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty? The anxiety is fuelled by several structural and political signals. Immigration has resurfaced as a contentious political theme. This has led to periodic unpredictability in visa outcomes, as we witnessed earlier this year, due to the visa pause.

Since OPT is the bridge that enables practical experience, employability, and loan repayment, these discussions around changes signal instability and intensify risk assessments.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26.

On one side, there’s a growing demand for balance, flexibility, and mental health. On the other hand, industry veterans like Narayana Murthy argue that relentless dedication — akin to China’s 9-9-6 schedule can propel the nation forward.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said.

During his college years, he participated in technical clubs and projects.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

IIE, a not-for-profit headquartered in New York, Monday released a fall 2025 snapshot survey on international student enrolment at 825 higher education institutions in the US. Around 57 per cent of these institutions reported a decrease in new international student enrolments for the 2025-26 academic year, while 14 per cent reported stable numbers, and 29 per cent indicated an increase.

The fall semester began in August/September this year. “For India, the top sender of international students whose numbers soared post-pandemic, the majority of institutions now report new enrolment declines, with only 39 per cent of institutions noting increased or stable numbers. These declines in new enrollment from India are likely driving the overall national declines in new enrollment,” the report on the fall 2025 session noted. In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals. While 96 per cent of institutions cited the visa application process as a factor in the decline of new international student enrolment this year, this figure was only 64 per cent in the fall of 2021, and was at 85 per cent last year.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean.

The Language and Cognition Laboratory, established within the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, is claimed as the first lab in India dedicated to systematically exploring the country’s vast linguistic diversity through experimental linguistics. According to a press release from IIT Madras, the laboratory was inaugurated on November 10 by Prof. V. Kamakoti, the Director of IIT Madras. The LC-Lab aims to investigate how humans perceive, process, and produce language using advanced experimental methods. It will employ techniques such as eye-tracking and reaction-time studies to examine how people process linguistic information. The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation. In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages. In the long term, it plans to integrate advanced neurocognitive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). These tools will enable comprehensive research in language, cognition, and computational modelling while fostering collaboration with experts in psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

In the 2025 academic year, the TS SSC exams began on March 21, 2025, and concluded on April 4, 2025. The examination spanned 15 days, with papers held in a single shift across the state. In 2019, the Telangana SSC examinations were held from March 15 or 16 to April 2, spanning nearly three weeks. This was one of the last sessions to follow the traditional March schedule before the disruptions caused by the pandemic. In 2020, the exams began on March 19 and were scheduled till April 6. However, the academic year was affected midway due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns that disrupted the evaluation process. The 2021 board exams were significantly delayed, starting on May 17 and ending on May 26. This shortened schedule reflected the adjustments made to compensate for lost instructional time and safety concerns. In 2022, the exams once again took place in late summer — from May 23 to June 1 — marking another delayed session before the schedule began to normalize in the following years. By 2023, the Telangana SSC exams returned closer to the usual time frame, being held from April 3 to April 13. The shorter, 11-day window helped the board align future sessions with the pre-pandemic calendar. The 2024 exams were conducted from March 18 to April 2, indicating a complete return to the standard March schedule. The examination period stretched over 16 days, giving students a familiar timetable after several disrupted years.

A draft artificial intelligence (AI) and computational thinking curriculum developed by the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) for classes 3 to 12 also focuses on introducing foundational concepts of AI in the lower classes, along with advanced computational thinking and AI as compulsory subjects in classes 9 and 10, official sources said. The draft curriculum, which has been submitted to the NCERT for review, provides a structure for schools to introduce computational thinking and AI in a phased and progressive manner from classes 3 to 12. The curriculum is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which calls for the introduction of “contemporary” subjects like AI, design thinking, and holistic health in the curriculum.

As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared. Recognising that reading lengthy passages on screens differs from paper, test-makers deliberately reduced passage lengths. Everything now fits on one screen, doing-away with the need for excessive scrolling. For years, XAT has carried a reputation for being one of the “toughest” MBA entrance examinations.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

He informed that all educational institutions in the state are being strengthened under this framework. Responding to a memorandum from the college principal, the chief minister announced that the process for sanctioning additional faculty and ministerial staff is already underway.

Expressing satisfaction over the development, Education Minister Bratya Basu said the examination was conducted in a transparent manner, bringing new hope to thousands of candidates. “Made possible due to the initiative of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the result is not just an administrative step but will materialise the possibility of new recruitment by December,” he said in a post on X, pledging the support of the state to make every future step transparent and bound by rules. Candidates who cleared the test will advance to the interview process, which evaluates pedagogical skills, subject knowledge, and communication abilities — essential competencies for effective teaching. Following the interviews, a final merit list will be prepared based on combined scores from both stages. Successful candidates will then undergo document verification, presenting original educational certificates, mark sheets, and valid identity proofs before final appointments are confirmed. Over 2.29 lakh candidates wrote the papers on September 14. A senior WBSSC official said it was not immediately possible to ascertain how many among the 26,000 teachers who lost their jobs after the Supreme Court’s April 1 verdict had qualified in the new test. “A large number of untainted candidates are expected to have cleared the exam,” the official added.

IIT Delhi Open House 2025 , which saw over 3,500 visitors, focused on ten key themes, including Healthcare, Biotechnology; Manufacturing, Industry 4.0, and Robotics; Smart and Sustainable Infrastructure; Advanced Material and Devices; Energy, Climate & Sustainability; Quantum & Semiconductor Technologies; Next Generation Communication; Management, Policy, Social Sciences; AI-ML/Data Science/Algorithms; and Fundamental Science. Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work.

The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm, Gross Labs. The investment will help expand the company’s “career readiness” programs across the U.S. Gross began his music career at 17 when his high school band, Open Air Stereo, gained significant exposure after being featured on MTV’s hit reality series “Laguna Beach.” Inspired by his experience, Gross came up with the idea for Find Your Grind after bringing students into his studio and seeing firsthand the challenges they face when exploring career options, often due to a lack of exposure in traditional schools. “Young people are entering a rapidly changing world of work,” Gross told TechCrunch. “As students prepare to leave school and enter into their professional careers, many are doing so without a strong sense of who they are, what they want, or how to navigate their next steps after school.

The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month . At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI , Perplexity , and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated.

The company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report. Pony.ai, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber. The ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period. Shares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report. Pony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees. The company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024.

Finding a mineral resource isn’t easy. Only about three in 1,000 potential deposits end up becoming commercially viable, and it can take years to prove it by drilling core samples. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days. The startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours. The Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide. Fleet Space said the results of lithium deposits might extend beyond Cisco’s current boundaries, saying the region has “district-scale potential.” Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

Just like other dictation tools, Speechify’s voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words. In my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify’s tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well. The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually. In terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like Wispr Flow , Willow , and Monologue . Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease. The startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.” While ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center. “We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That’s what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday, more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020 . It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery. Companies, from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China.

Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.” Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless ” and pocket-sized . Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io , to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco. Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes. “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said. The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted.

Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.” U.S. District Judge Eumi K.

Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission. “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding. The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity. The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.” (The Verge first reported Rad Power’s disagreement with the CPSC.)

Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko , is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “ An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own .” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox , I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network.

As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark. Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users.

X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity. Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led the first installment of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy more than 600 megawatts of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon’s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039. X-energy is in a race with several other SMR startups to resuscitate the nuclear industry in the United States.

Reuters first reported this weekend that DOGE had broken up, ending the months-long effort by Musk and his associates — many recruited from his various private-sector companies — to reduce alleged fraud and waste and cut employees across the federal government. DOGE was created by an executive order signed by President Trump in January. The initiative was expected to run for close to two years. As of early November, DOGE “doesn’t exist,” according to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources department. In a tweet on Sunday, Kupor said that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.” Amy Gleason, who was named as the “official” acting administrator of DOGE earlier this year, posted on LinkedIn soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.” While active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. DOGE’s cuts have also been blamed for countless deaths across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.

Late last month, the Intercept reported that ICE intends to hire bounty hunters and private investigators for street-level verification work. Contractors would confirm home and work addresses for people targeted for removal by—among other techniques—photographing residences, documenting comings and goings, and staking out workplaces and apartment complexes. Those filings cast the initiative as a substantial but limited pilot program. Contractors were guaranteed as little as $250 and could earn no more than $90 million each, with the overall program capped at $180 million. That structure pointed to meaningful scale but still framed the effort as a controlled trial, not an integral component of ICE’s removal operations. Newly released amendments dismantle that structure. ICE has removed the program’s spending cap and replaced it with dramatically higher per-vendor limits. Contractors may now earn up to $281.25 million individually and are guaranteed an initial task order worth at least $7.5 million. The shift signals to ICE’s contracting base that this is no longer an experiment, but an investment, and that the agency expects prime-tier contractors to stand up the staffing, technology, and field operations needed to function as a de facto arm of federal enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. The proposed scope was already large. It described contractors receiving monthly recurring batches of 50,000 cases drawn from a docket of 1.5 million people.

After all, some people want a simpler entry into the world of PC gaming that doesn't involve tinkering. That's where a PC like the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes into play—in theory. While Alienware typically addresses the higher-end demographic with its gaming desktops and laptops, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is the company's most serious attempt yet to offer its gaming goods at a lower price. Overall, I've been happy with what you get with the Aurora, especially when I've seen sales that dip the price to $1,500. I recently reviewed the Dell Tower Plus , a prebuilt desktop I liked quite a lot. Turns out, the Aurora Gaming Desktop is almost identical to that PC, but with the Alienware branding (Dell owns Alienware). You get a ring of Tron -esque light around the intake fans at the front, as well as the smattering of honeycomb perforations along the glass window in the side panel. And the alien head itself is the power button. Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop Rating: 7/10 It’s accurate to say that the Aurora feels like a gamer skin on the Dell Tower Plus, but that’s not a complaint. I found a lot to like about the way Dell balanced ease of use, upgradability, and price—and it translates well enough for gaming hardware. It’s not using fully off-the-shelf parts, but there’s enough here to make specific upgrades well into the future. Like the Dell Tower Plus, the Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop comes in a custom case with an Intel Z890 Alienware motherboard, which has two DIMM slots of memory and two PCIe 5 M.2 slots for SSDs. Even though a standard ATX or Micro-ATX motherboard would fit, swapping in a new one would be difficult due to the use of proprietary connectors. An AMD CPU is a better option for prebuilt desktops like this, as you might be able to upgrade in future generations because AMD supports the same socket in a way that Intel does not. In other words, if you want a new CPU for the Aurora in a few years, yo", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/alienware-aurora-gaming-desktop/", "timestamp": 1764105369.8608522}

Nothing Amazon Nothing The Nothing Headphone (1) has basically every feature you'd expect from a much higher-end offering, including high-resolution audio, the ability to connect to and remember multiple devices, and even object-based surround for watching a movie on a long flight. They're all controlled through the Nothing app, which is available for both iOS and Android. Sound quality is excellent, partially thanks to a collaboration with British speaker maker KEF , and these 40-mm drivers have excellent low-mid performance that gives them a unique pop. The soundstage isn't quite as expansive as some of the very best, but it gets most of the way there without costing nearly as much. Similarly, the active noise canceling doesn't match the performance on the big hitters like Sony or Bose , but excellent fit and passive isolation pick up the slack.

Every year, I test a dozen or more devices to find the best cheap phones that perform where it counts and aren’t annoyingly slow. Wireless carriers in the US go out of their way to make expensive smartphones seem affordable. AT&T will advertise a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for just $36 a month, but don't let that fool you. With over 36 monthly installments, you spend over a thousand bucks on a phone. Your pricey device may also keep you locked into the network, unable to switch wireless carriers until the phone is paid off. Get a seriously great, affordable smartphone instead. That's especially important in today's tariff-rich environment . Our top pick, the Google Pixel 9a , costs $499 and is as good as almost any flagship device.

If you want a great deal on a cheap phone that came out in 2025, then yes. However, cheap phones typically launch in the first half of the year, so that means we're not far from the 2026 models of many of these options. For example, the iPhone 16e arrived in February of 2025, so an iPhone 17e may launch around the same time in 2026. Motorola has already started launching its 2026 Moto G lineup, starting with the Moto G Play 2026. If you're not in a rush and would prefer the latest model, wait a few months.

(And yes, Galaxy phones are Android phones , though Samsung calls its layer over Android “One UI.”) Google's Pixel phones are my favorite Android devices , but Samsung's offerings are just as great and often have better hardware. Alongside Google, Samsung promises the longest software support for its cheap and high-end devices.

How to Keep Your Kid Safe Online There’s an element of risk with any device that can connect to the internet, so take the time to configure your child’s speaker and ensure that any related accounts are secure. Discuss rules : Talk with your children to agree on rules about what they can use their speaker for, and, for smart speakers , how they should speak to it. Secure your accounts and network : Make sure you select strong, unique passwords for your devices and Wi-Fi network, using a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. Always use two-factor authentication (2FA) where available (here’s how to activate 2FA on your Amazon account ). Use parental controls : You can set up parental controls with Apple, Google, and Microsoft accounts , and use them to lock down various devices , including speakers. You may also have parental controls on your router or mesh that enable you to schedule downtime for your child’s devices, so they can’t access the internet in the middle of the night, for example.

The platform is facing multiple lawsuits over child safety.", "content": "Last month, Kentucky attorney general Russell Coleman announced the details of yet another lawsuit against Roblox over suspected pedophiles lurking on the hugely popular gaming platform. While doing so, Coleman singled out the work of one self-described “predator hunter” who claims to have helped identify alleged abusers mixing with young gamers. “Roblox is even trying to silence those who raised these security risks,” Coleman said. “The famous case of one of their developers, Schlep, immediately comes to mind.” Schlep is in fact Michael, a 22-year-old Texan who has spent the last two years working with a group of other Roblox players to track down and identify people purportedly seeking to groom young children on the platform—predators like the one Schlep says allegedly groomed him a decade ago, which he says led him to try to take his own life. In the process of attempting to out suspected groomers, Schlep—who doesn’t share his surname for privacy reasons—has amassed 2.3 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he highlights what he believes to be the shortcomings of Roblox’s safety features and reveals the identities of the alleged predators he has tracked down. But on August 8, Schlep received a cease-and-desist letter from Roblox, and instantly, all of his accounts were banned. His predator hunter days were over. “While Roblox acknowledges that your stated intentions may be to protect children, and while it recognizes the serious nature of online predatory behavior, your methods, including failing to immediately report suspicious activity to Roblox through proper channels, are actively interfering with Roblox’s established safety protocols and, critically, are exposing Roblox’s users to increased risk,” the company wrote in the letter reviewed by WIRED. Roblox’s cease-and-desist against Schlep comes amid mounting pressure against the company.

That's at least part of the reasoning behind the existence of the LG UltraFine Evo 6K. This 32-inch monitor aims to put even more pixels in front of content creators and professionals. Beyond that, it has an attention-grabbing design and off-the-charts image quality. It's one of the best monitors you can buy for content creators, despite some of the unfortunate trade-offs it comes with. The 32-inch LG UltraFine Evo 6K is a very pretty monitor. I wouldn't blame you for mistaking this as an Apple product, given the focus on clean lines, simple shapes, and designerly aesthetic. The extra-wide stand means that the base itself isn’t overly large. Like the Apple Studio Display , the flat base provides more usable desk space rather than occupying it. The stand itself has a unique design, too. It resembles the styling Apple uses on the iMac and Studio Display, but it has a textured pattern on the back. It’s gorgeous, though you probably won’t spend a lot of time looking at the back of the monitor unless your desk is in the middle of the room or in command position (if you know, you know). LG UltraFine Evo 6K Monitor Rating: 7/10 I also like that the back of the cabinet is flat, giving it a sleek look that the rounded backs of typical monitors can’t achieve. Because it uses conventional backlighting, though, it’s not as thin as OLED displays like some of Samsung’s Odyssey gaming monitors . The UltraFine 6K also has some impressively thin bezels, too, adding to the ultra-modern aesthetic. While they’re not “virtually borderless” as LG states, they’re smaller than the bezels on most monitors I’ve tested. One of my favorite aspects of the UltraFine Evo 6K is the speakers. The pair of included speakers on this might be the best I've heard on a monitor. They are extremely loud and clear. There's even a decent amount of bass in there, to the point where you won't need a pair of computer speakers .

This is where mushroom coffee makes its inevitable entrance. Some quick googling revealed 10 known players in the game, all of which offer their own riff on a common base formula of dried mushrooms–usually a combo of lion’s mane , chaga , and cordyceps —boosted with buzzy add-ons like probiotics and nootropics. I spent a week with each, including our top pick, Atlas Coffee Club’s Latte Superblend ($26) , swapping out my morning coffee for each brand's recommended dose of powder and hot water. After day five I allowed myself to experiment with sweeteners and milks, which you’ll need with almost all of these to get through the entire cup without gagging.

Immediately after his sentencing, Bankman-Fried signaled his intention to appeal . In spring, he spoke to a handful of reporters from prison. But otherwise, he has largely receded from public view.

From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works. I've found Unbound's T-shirts in particular to be very quick-drying and wrink", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/unbound-merino-black-friday-sale-2025/", "timestamp": 1764105372.0118227}

You can grab an Oura Ring 4 for just $249 from Amazon , a $100 break from the normal price. It's compatible with both iOS and Android apps, has a battery that last for days, and accurately tracks a ton of health data, from hiking and sleeping to period predictions and food intake. Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability. The sensors have been recessed further into the body of the ring itself, which reduces the overall thickness considerably and allows for a wider available range of ring sizes. They also cover a wider portion of the ring, so there's no need to keep it oriented in one specific direction to get proper readings. The battery life has improved a lot as well. The older Oura 3 could run for around three days before it needed a charge, Our reviewer, Adrienne So, reported that the Ring 4 tracked a full weekend of hiking and physical activity, as well as a music festival, and still had enough juice for at least a couple more days. You get a ton of health and physical fitness data from the ring, which is neatly sorted into daily physical data, detailed vitals, and longer trends over time, all organized in the app on your phone. If you want to also keep track of your food intake, a new Meals feature lets you take photos of what you eat and then track its effects on your body. Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes. Thankfully, the mirrored silver and classic black are marked down to the lower $249 price point, with varying discounts on the other options, like $299 for the brushed silver ,", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/oura-ring-4-deal-1125/", "timestamp": 1764105372.1247203}

The console you spent countless hours huddled around as a kid is now old enough to be crippled by student debt and burdened with existential despair, just like you! If that reminder of the cruel and ceaseless march of time makes you want to retreat into a nostalgic bubble when life was easier and, say, play some N64 games, unfortunately, that's been pretty tricky in recent years. Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly due to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs in terms of connectivity or resolution. Analogue 3D Rating: 9/10 Enter, then, the Analogue3D, the latest console from the makers of the Analogue Pocket . Like its portable predecessor, this is a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) piece of kit that perfectly mimics the original console, allowing you to play authentic game carts without emulation. It goes beyond being a third-party remake though—it runs those games better than ever thanks to a baked-in virtualized Expansion Pak and the ability to overclock, beautifully presenting games with a host of display options, and outputting it all in glorious 4K. Throw in universal support for N64 carts and accessories from anywhere in the world, meaning the region lockouts of the '90s are literally a thing of the past, and this might just be my favorite \"new\" console of 2025.

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet cofounded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him. Nnormal Backcountry Nnormal Nnormal's aim is to institute sustainable practices into manufacturing gear. “Probably the most important system is the most complicated,” Jornet said. “It's very costly to be constantly rotating things … how can we have [a company] that's not based on overconsumption?” The solution was to create incredibly durable running shoes that only have to be swapped out every two to four years.

Like many folks of a certain age, my love of video games was born amid the bleeps and bloops of an arcade. These smoky, dark dens of gaming iniquity used to be everywhere, enticing you in with flashing marquees, simple synth melodies, and crunchy 8-bit explosions. As soon as I got my hands on a joystick and mashed a few buttons, I was hooked. While home arcade machines will never compete with a fully fledged arcade, good arcades are few and far between nowadays, unless you can manage a trip to Tokyo . You could snag one of the best retro game consoles for under the TV, but there’s something special about the controls and the artwork of a home arcade machine, and they give you a chance to play classic games with your family and friends the way the designers intended. Updated November 2025: We added the G'AIM'E Time Crisis Premium Light Gun, dimensions for each cabinet, and updated prices. Are Home Arcade Machines Worth It? Most home arcade machines are at least as expensive as the latest game consoles, sometimes far more expensive. They usually come with several games included, but they are still a considerable investment, so think carefully before you buy. Don’t get hung up on how many titles are included. It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal.

This means that security teams at tech companies have more code than ever to review while dealing with even more pressure from bad actors. On Monday, Amazon will publish details for the first time of an internal system known as Autonomous Threat Analysis (ATA), which the company has been using to help its security teams proactively identify weaknesses in its platforms, perform variant analysis to quickly search for other, similar flaws, and then develop remediations and detection capabilities to plug holes before attackers find them. ATA was born out of an internal Amazon hackathon in August 2024, and security team members say that it has grown into a crucial tool since then. The key concept underlying ATA is that it isn't a single AI agent developed to comprehensively conduct security testing and threat analysis. Instead, Amazon developed multiple specialized AI agents that compete against each other in two teams to rapidly investigate real attack techniques and different ways they could be used against Amazon's systems—and then propose security controls for human review. “The initial concept was aimed to address a critical limitation in security testing—limited coverage and the challenge of keeping detection capabilities current in a rapidly evolving threat landscape,\" Steve Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, tells WIRED. “Limited coverage means you can’t get through all of the software or you can’t get to all of the applications because you just don’t have enough humans. And then it’s great to do an analysis of a set of software, but if you don’t keep the detection systems themselves up to date with the changes in the threat landscape, you’re missing half of the picture.” As part of scaling its use of ATA, Amazon developed special “high-fidelity” testing environments that are deeply real", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-autonomous-threat-analysis/", "timestamp": 1764105372.9345818}

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy , the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

According to the Financial Times, the first review of possible amendments could take place toward the end of 2026 as part of a broader Digital Omnibus package, which aims to simplify guidelines. At a daily press briefing on November 7, Thomas Regnier, the spokesman for the European Commission for Digital Sovereignty, acknowledged mounting concerns. “A lot is happening in the field of artificial intelligence.

It's comprised of a ring of magnets on the back of the phone, and it was developed to create a faster, more precise wireless charging system. However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets. If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone.

It’s probably no surprise they're all OLEDs , which not only control each tiny point of light at the pixel level, but have also gotten brighter and better in each of the last few years. What might surprise you if you haven’t shopped TVs in a while is that Panasonic now joins the usual suspects from Samsung, Sony, and LG with its new flagship, the Z95B. It’s a doozy. As with last year’s Z95A that marked Panasonic’s impressive US return , the Z95B provides near-flawless performance, from perfect black levels to pristine detail and colors. It’s brighter and more striking, thanks to skillful deployment of the same breakthrough RGB tandem panel used in the stunning LG G5 , and its built-in sound is easily the best I’ve heard from any TV all year. The biggest downside is that its premium performance is again paired with a budget smart interface; Panasonic’s version of Fire TV is awkwardly laid out and flooded with Amazon ads, right down to the remote. But for well-heeled buyers who'd rather sub in a streaming device over a soundbar or speakers , the Z95B is one of the best TVs I've laid eyes (or ears) on. Setting up the Z95B’s hardware is joyously simple once you pry it loose from its jigsaw of foam and cardboard. The industrial-strength swivel stand comes in one piece and attaches in seconds, keeping the 65-inch model I tested stable and accessible with four small screws. The TV looks the part of a premium flagship, with thin bezels and fabric-wrapped acoustic accents. Panasonic Z95B OLED TV Rating: 9/10 The circular base is slim enough to support an add-on soundbar, but this TV functions best as an all-in-one. One reason is the HDMI selection, which includes just two ports with HDMI 2.1 support for features like ALLM and VRR at up to 144 Hz, one of which is the eARC/ARC port where a soundbar or speaker system would connect.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war.

But what if you want to bring the full excitement of the movies home? How can you ensure you’re getting an audio performance that will do justice to the pictures you’re watching? By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need. Below you'll find everything you need to know about getting started with surround sound, and the kind of setup you will need in order to achieve it. Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup. You may have seen surround sound setups described numerically—most commonly as 5.1-channel or 7.1-channel surround sound systems, but so", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-perfect-surround-sound-speaker-setup/", "timestamp": 1764105375.0870605}

Today's digital antennas already provide multiple high-definition OTA (over-the-air) channels, and if your TV supports ATSC 3.0 , you can expect an uptick in modern features in the future, from HDR (which some channels already offer) to 4K UHD and beyond. To find the best indoor TV antenna for your money, we tested multiple models over several months in both rural and metro areas, and we're always trying new ones. While most digital antennas pulled the bulk of available channels in our test areas, certain styles and brands tend to be more stable and receptive to the growing list of available broadcasts. Below, we've outlined our favorites along with a few to avoid. We've added tips, tricks, and links to help you find what you need and get the most from your purchase. For related info, check out our Best TVs and Best Soundbars lists, as well as our guide on how to set up your TV and how to choose the right TV . Buying a Mohu or Antennas Direct model?

Before purchasing an antenna, I highly recommend checking out AntennaWeb.org , which can help determine which channels and what kind of broadcast quality and features you can expect. If you live in a rural location, you may want to consider a high-powered outdoor TV antenna or other digital live TV alternatives ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-tv-antennas/", "timestamp": 1764105375.8898985}

We sliced, diced, and minced to find the best for every home chef.", "content": "Amazon Crate & Barrel Amazon Amazon Not all knives are created equal, and a chef’s knife is given that name for a reason. Like the proverbial dog to man, a chef needs their knife. Arguably the most important multipurpose tool you can find in a kitchen, it's the chef's main weapon—it can slice, dice, and chop ingredients with speed and precision. A chef's knife generally has a super-sharp end point and a curved, sloping edge. This curve is what makes the chef knife stand out, as it's designed to work with the natural rocking motion for quick chopping that also allows for finer cuts. With technology like ovens with cameras inside and AI-enabled refrigerators , the chef's knife remains the simple tool necessary for any kitchen. However, not every chef's knife is created equal—the best chef's knife varies by what's best for the individual person, including factors like comfort level while wielding kitchen tools, the size of your hands (it even varies if you're a lefty or righty), and what type of food you're cooking. The basic 6- to 8-inch chef knife works best for most people, especially for beginners. It's the most versatile knife, able to slice meat, dice dense veggies, and smash and mince garlic. Chef's knives can range from the price of a specialty latte to hundreds of dollars. We've sliced and diced for in our kitchens for hours to find a range of chef's knives that will work best for nearly every type of cook, and we've found that the Hedley & Bennett Chef's Knife for $120 is best for most people, with the Shun Premier Blonde 6-Inch Chef's Knife for $200 as our favorite Japanese knife.

Derby Nov 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday the Federal Reserve's system of managing interest rates is struggling and needs to be simplified. \"We've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated\" and the U.S. central bank should \"simplify things,\" Bessent said in an interview with CNBC. \"The Fed has taken us into a new regime, and what is called ample-reserves regime. And it looks like that might be fraying a bit here in terms of whether the reserves are actually ample,\" Bessent said. The Treasury secretary did not say what he meant by fraying. The Fed has faced and continues to face challenging money market conditions tied to how it has been managing its $6.56 trillion balance sheet and financial system liquidity levels. Officials at the Fed's last policy meeting announced that they would stop the contraction of the central bank's overall balance sheet at the start of December. They did so as liquidity in financial markets in the run-up to the late October policy meeting tightened enough to complicate control of the federal funds rate, the Fed's primary tool to achieve its inflation and employment goals. The turbulence was such that it drove eligible financial firms to borrow notable levels of cash from the Fed via its Standing Repo Facility, a tool used to put a ceiling over short-term interest rates. There were also intermittent large inflows of cash into the Fed's reverse repo tool, which is used to set a floor underneath money market rates. CRITIC OF FED BALANCE SHEET Bessent has been a persistent Fed critic who has expressed particular concern about its large balance sheet, which is primarily stocked with trillions in bonds bought in large part to stabilize financial markets and to provide stimulus to the econom", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-treasury-secretary-takes-aim-at-feds-interest-rate-control-system-11764104527861.html", "timestamp": 1764105438.6115682}

He said the decision was part of a new emphasis on speedy fleet expansion, and that funds designated for the shops will be “put toward future Navy needs.” The decision is a blow to Trieste, Italy-based Fincantieri SpA, whose Wisconsin-based subsidiary had been contracted to build the frigates. The company “will be involved” in the Navy’s plans, Phelan said. About $2.5 billion has been spent to date, the Navy said in a separate statement. “Keeping this critical workforce employed and the yard viable for future Navy shipbuilding is of foremost concern,” Phelan said. A key factor in today’s decision is “the need to grow the fleet faster to meet tomorrow’s threats,” he said. Trump touted the contracts toward the end of his first term as president, praising both their maneuverability and the fact that the Fincantieri subsidiary was based in the swing state of Wisconsin. In his closing remarks at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump reminded the audience of that fact. “It was a big contract that everybody wanted,” Trump said. “I gave it to Wisconsin, but we’re going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states.” But the program has long been beset by trouble. The Navy disclosed in April 2024 that the first frigate — which started construction in 2022 — was projected to be three years later than its contracted April 2026 delivery date. Much of the blame was put on difficulties in hiring an experienced workforce. The first vessel is 12% complete and the second has not started construction, according to the Navy. It said “contractor perfo", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/navy-cuts-orders-for-frigate-trump-once-touted-as-beautiful-11764104099371.html", "timestamp": 1764105438.7157133}

According to the MS Now report, which cited three people without being named, the President and his top aides have grown increasingly frustrated by the unflattering headlines Kash Patel has recently generated. The report claimed that Patel has come under scrutiny for his stewardship of bureau resources, including his girlfriend’s security detail. However, reacting to the report, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a photo of Kash Patel and Donald Trump, saying this story is completely made up. “In fact, when this Fake News published, I was in the Oval Office, where President Trump was meeting with his law enforcement team, including FBI Director Kash Patel.” Leavitt claimed that when she read the headline to the President, he laughed and said: “What?

Trump wrote on Truth Social that his team had made “tremendous progress” over the past week toward ending the war, which he again asserted “would have NEVER started” if he had been president. He said 25,000 soldiers had died in the past month, arguing that the conflict demanded urgent action. Trump said the original 28-point US peace proposal, drafted by Washington and widely criticised for aligning with Russian demands, had been “fine-tuned” with “additional input from both sides.” Only a few points of disagreement remain, he said, without providing details. The plan has since been revised to 19 points , according to Ukrainian officials, though Moscow insists only Trump’s original framework is acceptable. To push the process forward, Trump said he has directed Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. At the same time, Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will meet Ukrainian officials. The White House previously confirmed that US, Ukrainian and European officials met in Geneva over the weekend to discuss a revised proposal. Trump said he would receive updates from Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.

Bolsonaro who has exhausted all his appeals, will remain in a special room at police headquarters in Brasilia — a secure space for protected prisoners with a bed, TV, air conditioning and private bathroom — where he is currently detained. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president to start the sentence in an order issued on Tuesday. His lawyers had asked the court to allow him to serve the sentence under house arrest, citing his age and a litany of health problems. However, the court denied that request in a separate order on Saturday. The former president, who governed Brazil from 2019 to 2022, was on trial over a botched coup bid. In August, he was placed under house arrest for violating measures imposed on him. In September, he was sentenced to 27 years in jail, following his conviction on charges that he attempted a coup to stop leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office after his 2022 election defeat. On November 22, citing him as potential flight risk , Supreme Court ordered Bolsonaro's detention after more than 100 days of house arrest. According to court records, Bolsonaro had told the judge that medicine-induced paranoia and hallucination caused him to tamper with an electronic ankle monitor. Bolsonaro denied any intent to escape or try to remove the ankle monitor, reported Reuters. In a petition to the top court, Bolsonaro lawyers said that sending the former president to prison ‘will have serious consequences and represents a risk to his life’, adding, \"His health condition is already deeply debilitated.\" The lawyers argued that Bolsonaro has already been hospitalised three times — twice for tests and once due to a medical emergency.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday refused to elaborate on Moscow’s position regarding ongoing US–Ukraine negotiations over Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, calling the surrounding discourse an “information frenzy.” “It is impossible to comment amid this information frenzy,” Peskov told reporters. “A lot of contradictory information is being published, contradictory statements, and so on.” Russian officials have largely avoided detailed public response to the weekend talks in Geneva, where US, European and Ukrainian officials discussed a revised American peace plan.

Duffy encouraged travelers to rethink their airport attire. “Whether it’s a pair of jeans and a decent shirt, I would encourage people to maybe dress a little bit better, which encourages us to maybe behave a little better,” he said. “Let’s try not to wear slippers and pajamas as we come to the airport.” He also urged passengers to avoid removing their shoes inflight or propping their feet on seats. “Don’t take your shoes off and put your feet on the chair ahead of you,” Duffy warned. The secretary urged travelers to show basic respect toward airline staff. “Say please and thank you to our pilots and to our flight attendants,” he said, adding that passengers should dress “with some respect.” He also encouraged passengers to help fellow travelers struggling with overhead baggage as a simple act of courtesy. Duffy’s initiative comes against the backdrop of a 400% surge in in-flight disturbances since 2019, according to FAA data. These incidents range from unruly behavior to violence, creating increasing strain for crew and airport security.  Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

Trump opened the ceremony with characteristic humor, saying, “The turkeys being pardoned today go by the names Gobble and Waddle. When I first saw their pictures...

The presidential turkey pardon has been observed for decades, but the tradition was formally recognised in 1989 when President George H.W. Bush declared that the turkey presented to him would be spared. Bush famously remarked, “This guy will not end up on anyone’s dinner table… he’s presented a presidential pardon as of right now.” Since that official proclamation, 60 turkeys have been pardoned. The public also participates through an annual naming poll. This year, Gobble and Waddle were selected via an online poll shared by the Office of the First Lady across social media platforms.

A key proposed reform is scrapping the long-standing “Intent to Leave” rule, which currently requires students to prove they will return home after their studies.", "content": "As the number of international students choosing the United States decreases, officials are now considering major modifications to student visa procedures that could influence global student mobility, hindustantimes.com reported. Tighter visa scrutiny and immigration crackdowns have made securing a US study visa more challenging. According to the news report, these stricter rules have discouraged many prospective students, leading to a noticeable decline in international enrolments. One of the most significant proposed changes concerns the repeal of the “Intent to Leave” rule, a requirement that has long shaped US student visa decisions. During visa interviews, students must prove they intend to return to their home country after completing their studies. This often includes demonstrating non-immigrant intent by showing ties to their home country — including property ownership, family obligations, or career plans. Students who cannot convincingly demonstrate this intent risk visa denial, even if their primary goal is education. The DIGNITY Act of 2025, introduced by Congresswomen María Elvira Salazar and Veronica Escobar with bipartisan support from 20 members, aims to abolish the “Intent to Leave” requirement. If approved, student visas can no longer be denied solely because an applicant fails to prove they intend to leave the US after their studies. However, the act does not change the rules for staying in the US after graduation. Students still must qualify through employment-based visas or other approved pathways. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed changing the admission period for F, J, and I visa holders from “duration of status” (D/S) to a fixed time period, HT reported.

One of the outlets will be opened within the premises of state-owned oil giant Aramco, and will serve non-Muslim foreign staff. The country is also launching one outlet in Dhahran in the east and another for diplomats in Jeddah, a port city. Saudi Arabia had banned alcohol 73 years ago, and it was only in 2024 that the kingdom opened a shop in Riyadh . A source told Reuters that both stores are expected to be opened in 2026. However, the Saudi government has not replied to questions by Reuters and Aramco has declined to comment on the development. No official change was made to Saudi Arabia's regulations when the initial Riyadh store was opened. The store, located inside a diplomatic quarter in a non-descript building, is popularly known as the \"booze bunker\". Besides easing the ban on alcohol, the country is also relaxing other norms in order to lure more international businesses and tourists. Earlier, under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country allowed women to drive in 2017, eased rules on segregation of men and women in public spaces, and curbed the powers of the religious police. People can now go to the cinema as wel as dance in rave parties in the country, as per Reuters . Saudi Arabia is wanting to diversify its economy to reduce its dependence on oil. In may, an unverified media report had claimed that Saudi authorities were planning to allow the sale of alcohol to tourists for the 2034 FIFA World Cup .

However, when we checked it ourselves, the search results clearly showed Palash Muchhal in the search results. This means Smriti Mandhana is still following Palash Muchhal. The speculation about the unfollow comes after Smriti Mandhana deleted all her social media posts about her wedding. The ceremony, scheduled to take place on 23 September, has been indefinitely cancelled. Smriti Mandhana’s wedding was cancelled after two back-to-back medical emergencies in the family. On the morning of the ceremony, her father fell seriously unwell during breakfast. He was rushed to Sarvhit Hospital with heart-attack-like symptoms. The next day, Palaash was also hospitalised due to sudden health issues. Smriti’s father is still under observation. Therefore, the family has decided to postpone the wedding until both of them recover. Palash Muchhal ’s mother, Amita Muchhal, earlier said that her son had wanted to postpone the wedding even before Smriti Mandhana did. She has told the Hindustan Times that Palash is very emotionally attached to Smriti’s father, Shrinivas Mandhana. Their relationship is even closer than the Smriti-Palash chemistry, she said.. So when “uncle” fell ill, Palash immediately decided that the wedding should not go ahead until he fully recovered. She explained that, after the haldi ceremony, Palash became very stressed and cried a lot, which suddenly made his health worse.

The latest quarterly estimates show that the number of unincorporated establishments edged up to about 7.97 crore in the July-September quarter, from 7.94 crore in the April-June period, a marginal gain but building on a sharp increase from the previous annual estimate of roughly 7.34 crore establishments for 2023-24. Employment in the sector stood at approximately 12.86 crore, a slight increase from the prior quarter yet noticeably higher than the more than 12 crore workers reported in the 2023–24 annual survey. The data, drawn from the National Statistics Office’s latest Quarterly Bulletin on Unincorporated Sector Enterprises, underscores the sector’s resilience at a time of uncertain global trade and economic pressures, the MoSPI survey said. “Despite global challenges and trade uncertainties, the unincorporated sector stayed afloat during the July–September quarter,” it added. Beyond the headline figures, the bulletin signals subtle and meaningful shifts in the sector’s composition. Internet use among enterprises increased steadily, rising to 39% in July–September from 36% in the previous quarter, indicating an acceleration in digital adoption, even among small, often informal operators. The recovery in unincorporated manufacturing stood out as both establishment counts and employment shares improved, with manufacturing’s share of establishments rising to 27% from 26% and its share of employment to 28% from 26% over the quarter. Women also continued to form a substantial portion of the workforce, accounting for nearly 29% of total employment during the latest quarter.

After being deemed unresponsive, she was rushed to a hospital.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "A woman in Thailand shocked everyone at a temple when she began moving inside her coffin just before cremation. Staff at Wat Rat Prakhong Tham temple in Nonthaburi were stunned. They saw slight movements of her arms and head when the coffin arrived in the back of a pickup truck. Pairat Soodthoop, the temple’s general and financial affairs manager, said the 65-year-old woman had been brought by her brother all the way from Phitsanulok, around 365km away. Pairat explained that she had been bedridden for two years. She recently became unresponsive, appearing to stop breathing two days earlier. So, the family believed she had passed away. On the way, the brother tried to fulfil her wish of donating her organs at a hospital in Bangkok. The hospital, however, refused the brother’s request because he didn’t have a death certificate. The temple, which offers free cremations , also declined for the same reason. At the temple, while the manager was explaining how to get the document, they heard knocking from the coffin. That led to the shocking realisation that she was still alive. The woman was checked and rushed to a nearby hospital. The abbot later agreed to cover her medical expenses. “I was a bit surprised, so I asked them to open the coffin , and everyone was startled. I saw her opening her eyes slightly and knocking on the side of the coffin. She must have been knocking for quite some time,” AP quoted Pairat as saying. According to a Twitter (now X) post, cases of people being buried alive were frequently reported in the 19th century. Bodies were later dug up, and coffins were found with scratch marks inside. This made people realise that some who were thought dead had actually been alive and tried to escape. To stop this from happening, inventors created “safety coffins” with an air tube and a rope connected to a bell. If someone woke up inside the coffin, they could breathe through the tube and pull the rope to ring the bell for help, according to the post. “Holy hel", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/knock-from-the-coffin-saves-her-65-year-old-woman-wakes-up-before-her-cremation-watch-video-11764083784476.html", "timestamp": 1764105441.3569899}

The Ghatkopar unit of the Anti-Narcotics Cell (ANC) summoned the two Bollywood celebrities as their names cropped up in the interrogation of Mohammed Salim Mohammed Suhail Shaikh, a key accused in a ₹ 252 crore mephedrone seizure case. The case in question dates back to March 2024 when the police seized 126.14 kg of mephedrone, commonly known as ‘MD’, valued at around ₹ 252 crore from a manufacturing unit located on a farm in Maharashtra’s Sangli district.

Forecasters say a couple of tornadoes cannot be ruled out.", "content": "The Storm Prediction Center (SPC), NOAA, National Weather Service , has warned of isolated severe thunderstorms across parts of the Southeast and Deep South on Tuesday (November 25), with the threat extending from the morning into the early evening hours. Forecasters say a couple of tornadoes are possible, particularly in eastern Mississippi and central Alabama , where conditions may briefly support rotating storms. A fast-moving line of showers and isolated thunderstorms crossed northern Alabama early Tuesday before shifting into northwest Georgia. However, the storms are entering an area with limited instability, with surface dew points only in the mid-50s, reducing the chance of damaging wind gusts in the morning hours. As the earlier storms move out, southerly winds are expected to bring back slightly moister and more unstable air into east-central Mississippi and central/northern Alabama. Though large-scale forcing is weak, daytime heating may trigger scattered thunderstorms by early afternoon. Any storms that form will develop in an environment with 20–30 knots of low-level southerly winds and enough deep-layer shear to support transient supercell structures. The SPC says this setup maintains the need for a Slight Risk despite weaker forcing mechanisms. Gusty winds and a few tornadoes remain the primary concerns.

Zelensky added that Germany has helped Ukraine a lot since the beginning of the war. Zelensky's post on X – stating that talks with US are still underway comes after a report by ABC News — citing a US official – mentioned that Ukraine agreed to a potential peace deal with some minor details to be sorted out. Hours after Zelensky's post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt – in a social media post on X – stated that further talks between Ukraine, Russia, and US are required, pertaining to “few delicate, but not insurmountable, details that must be sorted out.” On Monday, POTUS Donald Trump mentioned in a social media post on that “big progress” was being made on a deal for Ukraine. Both Ukraine and US Presidents' comments about the deal comes as US Army Secretary Driscoll is in Abu Dhabi reportedly meeting with the Russian side. Driscoll – who is reportedly an ally of US vice-president JD Vance – commenced talks with the Russians on Monday night, according to a US official and two people familiar with the meeting. Ukraine has agreed to cap its army only to 800,000 personnel — reported Financial Times , citing a Ukrainian official. The initial Trump plan had proposed a 600,000 limit. Trump and Zelensky will later decide the most sensitive issues – territorial matters and US security guarantees, as per FT. Oleksandr Bevz, one of the Ukrainian delegates at the talks between the US and Ukraine in Geneva, said that the numbers of points in the proposed settlement was reduced, but he denied reports that the 28-point US peace plan now consisted of 19 points. \"(The document) is going to continue ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/ukraine-us-send-mixed-signals-zelensky-denies-deal-done-report-says-talks-still-underway-11764078643658.html", "timestamp": 1764105442.329155}

Indian-origin steel tycoon is reportedly moving there.", "content": "Indian-origin billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, one of the richest tycoons of the United Kingdom, has reportedly decided to leave the country. According to a report by The Sunday Times , the shocking decision comes as the Labour Party government marches ahead to table a tax reform system that targets the untra-rich. According to the report, Mittal, the India-born founder of ArcelorMittal, is now a taxpaying resident of Switzerland and will move to the Naïa Island in Dubai. The steel magnate already owns a mansion in Dubai and has recently bought “tracts of an intriguing development on nearby Naïa Island ,” as per The Sunday Times report. Rachel Reeves’ second Budget as UK Chancellor is expected to impose further taxes across the board to address an estimated 20 billion pounds hole in the UK's finances. The move has prompted several billionaires, including Mittal, to shift their bases to other countries. An adviser familiar with the Mittal family’s plans told The Sunday Times that inheritance tax, not income tax, was the decisive factor. Dubai on the other hand is more lenient in terms of taxes with zero inheritance tax, clear laws on global assets, and a transparent regulatory and tax regime. Naïa Island is an upcoming private, man-made island that is being developed in Dubai , off the coast of Jumeirah. It is being developed by Shamal Holding in the water at Jumeirah beachfront. The super-luxury destination will feature the region’s first ‘Cheval Blanc’ maison (or home) — a part of the LMVH family. Located in between Umm Suqeim and Jumeirah 3, the sprawling low-rise project will have suites and private villas. “A limited number of branded beachfront residences and estate plots will be available, each with private beach access offering a rare opportunity to reside on an island where design, nature, and lifestyle exist together perfectly,” said a statement from Shamal.

Australian Senator wears burqa in Parliament, sparks uproar — A look at her personal life, career", "summary": "Pauline Hanson, a 71-year-old far-right Senator, was suspended for seven sitting days after wearing a burqa in a protest to ban the garment. The Senator said that her One Nation was stopped from even introducing a Bill, meaning the Parliament couldn't have a debate.", "content": "Pauline Hanson, the 71-year-old far-right Australian Senator, faced condemnation from lawmakers for wearing a burqa in her campaign to ban the Muslim garment in public and was suspended for seven sitting days. On Monday, Hanson was shrouded in a head-to-ankle black garment as the Senate refused to consider her bill seeking a ban on the burqa in public places. In the absence of an apology, the Senators passed a censure motion barring her from seven consecutive Senate sitting days. It is said to be one of the harshest penalties against a senator in recent decades. Her suspension will continue when Parliament resumes in February next year. In 2017, too, the Senator created outrage after wearing a burqa in a similar protest. However, she was not punished at that time. Speaking to reporters, Hanson said she would be judged by voters in the next election, scheduled for 2028. “They didn’t want to ban the burqa, yet they denied me the right to wear it on the floor of Parliament. There is no dress code on the floor of Parliament, yet I’m not allowed to wear it. So to me, it’s been hypocritical,” she said. “Liberals, Nationals, Labour and the Greens are all fighting One Nation because we are the only party debating the issues they won't talk about. One Nation was stopped from even introducing a Bill, meaning the Parliament couldn't have a debate. That's not democracy. The people will judge me when I face the next election. My future is in the people's hands, not these gutless politicians,” Hanson said in a post on X. Malaysian-born Penny Wong, who leads the government in the Senate, said that Hanson had mocked and vilified an entire faith by wearing a burqa. “Sen. Hanson’s hateful and shallow pageantry tears at our social fabric, and I believe it makes Australia weaker, and it also has cruel consequences for many of our most vulnerable, including in our school yards,” Wong told the Senate.

Explained", "summary": "A volcano in northern Ethiopia erupted for the first time in almost 10,000 years, with high columns of ashes being sent into the atmosphere and triggering meteorological departments across the world. Should you be worried?", "content": "With the ash clouds from Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi Volcano reaching Delhi NCR, residents are concerned about its health effects, given that the national capital has already been suffering from poor air quality for over a month. A volcano in northern Ethiopia erupted for the first time in almost 10,000 years, sending high columns of ash into the atmosphere and triggering meteorological departments across the world. Fast upper-level winds carried the debris and ashes thousands of kilometres, with India getting affected for a brief period as a cloud passed over its northern and western parts. The Ethiopian volcano ash mass had initially entered Gujarat on Monday before spreading overnight across regions including Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Delhi-NCR, Haryana and Punjab. The plume of volcanic ash, which moved across northwest India on Monday and briefly disrupted flights, has since begun shifting towards China. The ashes from the plume rose as high as 14 kilometres. Ash columns from the Ethiopian volcanic eruption in the Afar region, approximately 800 km northeast of Addis Ababa, near the Eritrean border, were carried across the Red Sea to Yemen and Oman by strong upper-level winds, eventually drifting over the Arabian Sea into western and northern India. The IMD noted that the plume travelled along high-altitude wind currents that transported it \"from Ethiopia across the Red Sea to Yemen and Oman and further over the Arabian Sea towards western and northern India,\" with satellite tools, VAAC bulletins and dispersion modelling aiding its monitoring. Volcanic ash is not the same as the typical ash we see from fires. It carries fine particles of fragmented volcanic rock of less than 2 mm diameter. Volcanic ash is a mixture of rock, mineral, and glass particles expelled from a volcano during a volcanic eruption. Due to their tiny size, they can travel for thousands of kilometres and can often cause health issues if inhaled in high concentrations.

We asked ChatGPT to verify the authenticity of the viral chat screenshots, which claim that Palash Muchhal allegedly cheated on Smriti Mandhana . It apparently involves a woman named Mary D’Costa. The artificial intelligence (AI) agreed to analyse it “purely from a technical and behavioural point of view”. “This is not a verdict since neither Smriti Mandhana nor Palaash Muchhal has confirmed anything,” it said. According to ChatGPT AI, certain signs make the screenshots appear more realistic. First, the Instagram DM layout, fonts, timestamps, reactions and icons match the current design. There are no obvious visual glitches that usually appear in edited chats. Secondly, the flow of conversation feels natural, with casual language, typos, pauses, emojis and quick emotional tone changes, which are hard to script perfectly. Third, the screenshots show continuity across multiple pages, repeatedly mentioning the same topics like swimming, Versova and Silver Beach, spa plans and “long-distance relationship being dead most of the time”. Finally, message stacking and emoji reactions look technically accurate and not copy-pasted. At the same time, ChatGPT flags some signs that suggest the leaked screenshots might not be genuine. The Instagram account that shared them, marydcosta_, is not a verified person or a public figure. So, her credibility cannot be checked, the AI chatbot says.

A report by Reuters claimed that US President Donald Trump 's department has disbanded with eight months left to its mandate. Speaking to the news agency, when asked about DOGE's status, Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said that it doesn't exist, adding, \"It is no longer a “centralized entity.” Kupor also claimed that OPM, the human resources office of the federal government, has since taken over many of DOGE's functions. A few months ago, Elon Musk , the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, departed from DOGE where he served as an administration adviser. However, in a post on X, DOGE termed it as fake news. “President Trump was given a mandate by the American people to modernize the federal government and reduce waste, fraud and abuse. Just last week, DOGE terminated 78 wasteful contracts and saved taxpayers $335M,” DOGE said in a post on X handle. It further added, “We’ll be back in a few days with our regularly scheduled Friday update.” Responding to a post by X handle DogeDesigner, which shared Reuter's news article, Musk targeted the news agency. In January 2025, the agency was set up to rapidly shrink federal agencies, cut their budgets or redirect their work to Trump priorities.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764105474.3333461}

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart.
