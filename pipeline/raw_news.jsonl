Of the total 18,82,318, includes 12,54,013 (over 12 lakh) students in universities and tertiary institutions. In a first, the Ministry has shared a total of 6,28,305 (6.28 lakh) are enrolled at the school-level. In the previous year, MEA had reported 13.3 lakh students in higher education alone, which means that the 2025 figure marks a decline in university-level enrolments year-on-year. When considering the combined tally of school and higher education students, the overall 2025 number is higher only because school data was added for the first time. The top three destinations in 2025 across both schooling and university education were the United Arab Emirates (2,53,832 students), the United States (2,55,447 students), and Canada (4,27,085 students), making them the largest hubs of Indian students globally.

Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system. To support their continued learning, NIOS enables such students to rejoin formal schooling in their parent institution once they successfully complete Class 10 through NIOS, said the Minister in the Rajya Sabha .

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank. Also Read | IIT Delhi BTech Placement Trends: Top-packages, companies Tests vary in difficulty with each session (so scores are not the same). Two students who score differently on the same exam can have the same percentile and therefore the same rank. Colleges determine your admission to a college and branch as well as rank using solely your percentile (raw marks are not included). Therefore, the percentile will always be viewed as the best benchmark for determining a good score on the JEE Main examination. Also Read| Is NCERT enough for preparation?

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits.

B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning.

We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said. Saha said the BJP-led government has adopted a transparent recruitment policy. “Government posts are being filled with complete transparency since the BJP came to power in the state. No one can claim to have secured a government job through recommendation, which was common in the previous regime,” he said. The government is also working to finalise a transparent transfer policy, he said. “A government doctor (MBBS) is required to serve three years in a rural hospital to get a chance to pursue MD or MS.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26.

The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction. Germany has crossed 4 lakh international students in the 2024/25 winter semester, supported by dual-citizenship reforms.

We don’t expect the evaluation load for the second board exam to be more than 20-30 lakh. So, we also hope that we will be able to complete evaluations quicker and be able to deliver the results for the second board exam in time. Our deadline is June 30…to close the entire cycle.” The Board had announced earlier this year that students will have to mandatorily appear for the first set of exams, and can then choose to improve their performance in three subjects (out of math, science, social science, and two language papers) in the second set of exams. Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together. It was not an easy decision, or an easy scheme to devise…not the least because the NEP and the NCF (national curriculum framework) itself talk about three options.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The Times joins several media outlets suing Perplexity, including the Chicago Tribune , which also filed suit this week. The Times’s suit claims that “Perplexity provides commercial products to its own users that substitute” for the outlet, “without permission or remuneration.” The lawsuit – filed even as several publishers, including The Times , negotiate deals with AI firms – is part of the same, ongoing years-long strategy. Recognizing the AI tide cannot be stopped, publishers use lawsuits as leverage in negotiations in the hopes of forcing AI companies to formally license content in ways that compensate creators and maintain the economic viability of original journalism. Perplexity tried to address compensation demands by launching a Publishers’ Program last year, which offers participating outlets like Gannett, TIME, Fortune and the Los Angeles Times a share of ad revenue. In August, Perplexity also launched Comet Plus , allocating 80% of its $5 monthly fee to participating publishers, and recently struck a multi-year licensing deal with Getty Images. “While we believe in the ethical and responsible use and development of AI, we firmly object to Perplexity’s unlicensed use of our content to develop and promote their products,” Graham James, a spokesperson for The Times, said in a statement. “We will continue to work to hold companies accountable that refuse to recognize the value of our work.” Similar to the Tribune’s suit, the Times takes issue with Perplexity’s method for answering user queries by gathering information from websites and databases to generate responses via its retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) products, like its chatbots and Comet browser AI assistant. “Perplexity then repackages the original content in written responses to users,” the suit reads. “Those responses, or outputs, often are verbatim or ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/the-new-york-times-is-suing-perplexity-for-copyright-infringement/", "timestamp": 1764952780.9142535}

Redwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a new business line focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds. By 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, investing another $350 million in the company to propel the new business line. Another startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup raised $1 billion in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion b", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/", "timestamp": 1764952781.119336}

The EC is taking issue with the fact that X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, has been allowing anyone to buy a “blue checkmark,” the platform’s long-standing symbol which used to indicate that a user has been verified to be who they are claiming to be. Calling the design of the blue checkmark system “deceptive,” the European Union’s executive arm on Friday imposed a fine of €120 million (about $140 million) on X, saying the company had breached its transparency obligations under the DSA. The Commission said other breaches of the law include a lack of transparency of X’s advertising repository and failure to provide researchers access to public data. Before Musk bought the company, Twitter used to issue blue checks to journalists, celebrities, politicians, and public figures on the platform after it had verified their identity. Musk did away with that policy in 2023, and all the “verified” blue check today indicates is that a user subscribes to X Premium, and that they meet certain eligibility criteria, like having a profile photo, a display name, and have linked their account to a phone number. “X’s use of the ‘blue checkmark’ for ‘verified accounts’ deceives users,” the Commission wrote in a statement . “This violates the DSA obligation for online platforms to prohibit deceptive design practices on their services. On X, anyone can pay to obtain the ‘verified’ status without the company meaningfully verifying who is behind the account, making it difficult for users to judge the authenticity of accounts and content they engage with.” The Commission added that such a system exposes users to scams, impersonation fraud and manipulation. The regulator also found that X’s advertisement repository doesn’t comply with DSA requirements for transparency and accessibility, saying the company imposes excessive delays in processing ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/in-its-first-dsa-penalty-eu-fines-x-e120m-for-deceptive-blue-check-verification-system/", "timestamp": 1764952781.2563004}

This agreement involves both HBO Max and the HBO studio, marking one of the largest mergers in Hollywood’s history. By making this move, Netflix is not just solidifying its top position but also significantly enhancing its content library, gaining access to well-known franchises such as DC Comics, “Game of Thrones,” and “Harry Potter.” While Netflix boasted over 300 million paying subscribers in January, HBO Max, in combination with Discovery+, currently has around 128 million subscribers. Additionally, the scale of Netflix’s offer is notable, as the streaming giant is investing $72 billion, which exceeds Warner Bros.’ entire market valuation of $60 billion. However, this merger isn’t without its challenges; it could face antitrust scrutiny. In November, senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Richard Blumenthal expressed concerns regarding the potential sale. The trio sent a letter to the Justice Department Antitrust Division indicating that any agreement would be viewed “under a cloud of political favoritism and corruption.” Additionally, various industry players are expressing their views. According to Variety , an anonymous group reportedly sent a letter to Congress urging them to publicly oppose Netflix’s offer. Warner Bros. Discovery officially put itself up for sale in October, burdened by debt and disappointing streaming growth. The company attracted interest from several suitors, with Paramount seen as the frontrunner. The acquisition is expected to finalize in the third quarter of 2026, after Warner Bros. Discovery follows through with its plan to separate from Discovery Global, which includes its collection of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. The companies estimate that the transaction, a mix of cash and stock, will be completed within 12 to 18 months.

He said that someday, he’d ask the AI. When everyone snickered, he added, “You can laugh. It’s all right. But it really is what I actually believe .” He wasn’t kidding. Sitting again in front of an audience , this time across Max Hodak, the co-founder and CEO of Science Corp ., I can’t help but remember that moment with Altman. Pale-complexioned Hodak, wearing jeans and a black zip-up sweatshirt, looks more like he’d fit in at a mosh pit than pitching a company valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. But he’s got a sly sense of humor that keeps the room engaged. Hodak started programming when he was six, and as an undergraduate at Duke, he worked his way into the lab of Miguel Nicolelis, a pioneering neuroscientist who has since become publicly critical of commercial brain-computer interface ventures. In 2016, Hodak co-founded Neuralink with Elon Musk, serving as its president and essentially running day-to-day operations until 2021. When I ask what he learned working alongside Musk, Hodak describes a specific pattern. “We got into lots of situations together where something would happen. In my mind, I’d have two diametrically opposed possible solutions, and I would bring them to him, and I’d be like, ‘Is it A or B?’ And he’d look at it and be like, ‘It’s definitely B,’ and the problem would never come back.” After a few years of this, Hodak took what he’d learned and roped in three former Neuralink colleagues to launch Science Corp. about four years ago. Like Altman, Hodak describes his team’s improbable goal so placidly that I find myself believing that the limits of cognition are about to be overcome sooner than most of us realize. And that he’ll be among those who make it happen. While I’ve been consumed with the AI data center craziness and the talent poaching wars , momentum has been building in the background.

On Thursday, PhonePe founder and group CEO Sameer Nigam said operating a consumer-facing quick-commerce app had become a distraction from the company’s core focus on small retailers. The company instead wants to concentrate on helping stores “achieve operational efficiency, improved margins and visibility,” he said, citing this as its primary objective. PhonePe launched Pincode in April 2023 as a major push into e-commerce, building it on the Indian government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The hyperlocal app offered groceries, medicines, food, electronics, and home décor from neighbourhood shops. It rolled out first in Bengaluru and later expanded to other cities. Within a little over a year of launch, Pincode pulled out of most categories except food. Earlier this year, the app shifted to a quick-commerce model , offering 10-minute deliveries through local kirana shops and retailers in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune. The company also expanded the service to 10-minute medicine deliveries in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Pune in April. PhonePe’s Pincode utilized local shops and retail stores for its quick deliveries — a contrast to rivals like Swiggy, Zomato-owned Blinkit, and Zepto, which rely on dark stores. The shift did not help Pincode gain ground in the crowded segment, prompting PhonePe to wind down the service. Pincode was not PhonePe’s first move into e-commerce. In 2019, the company launched “Switch,” a super-app layer inside its payments app that offered access to food, grocery, shopping, and travel services. PhonePe has now shut down the Pincode app and redirected its website to PhonePe’s main site. The company said it will now focus on working with offline retailers by expanding its B2B offerings.

The suit, seen by TechCrunch, was filed in a federal court in New York. The Tribune alleges that its lawyers contacted Perplexity in mid-October asking if the AI search engine was using its content, according to the complaint. Perplexity’s lawyers replied it did not train models with the Tribune’s work but that it “may receive non-verbatim factual summaries,” the lawsuit claims. The Tribune’s lawyers, however, argue that Perplexity is delivering Tribune content verbatim. Interestingly, the newspaper’s lawyers are also calling out Perplexity’s retrieval augmented generation (RAG) as a culprit. RAG is a method used to limit hallucinations by having the model only use an accurate or verified data source. The Tribune argues that Perplexity is using the newspaper’s content in its RAG systems, scraped without permission. Plus, it alleges the Perplexity’s Comet browser is bypassing the paper’s paywall to deliver detailed summaries of those articles. The Tribune is one of 17 news publications from MediaNews Group and Tribune Publishing that sued OpenAI and Microsoft over model training material: eight sued in April and another nine sued in November. Those suit are ongoing.

And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise. This year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears that AI is coming for engineering jobs. AWS re:Invent 2025 , which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the “true value” of AI. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” he said during the December 2 keynote. “This is where we’re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.” On December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe. “We are living in times of great change,” Sivasubramanian said during the talk. “For the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.” While AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too.

Reuters was the first to report on the letter, which comes two months since the agency opened an investigation into Waymo over how its robotaxis perform around stopped school buses. The agency’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into the Alphabet-owned company in October after seeing footage of a Waymo autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus — with its stop sign extended and lights flashing — that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street. Waymo has said the bus was partially blocking the driveway and that the robotaxi could not see the flashing lights or stop sign.

The Austin School District has reported 19 different instances of Waymo automated vehicles illegally passing school buses since the beginning of the 2025-26 school year. The school district noted in a letter to Waymo that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software on November 17.

The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). Today, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it announced its $35 million Series A at a $500 million valuation. Ansari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years. Micro1’s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with Scale AI following Meta’s $14 billion investment in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale’s CEO. While Micro1’s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn’t yet matched its rivals: Mercor’s more than $450 million, sources told TechCrunch, and Surge’s reported $1.2 billion in 2024. Ansari attributes Micro1’s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform.

Amodei declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer to the question of a bubble, saying it was a complex situation, but instead explained his thoughts about the economics of AI in more detail. He described himself as bullish on the potential of the technology, but cautioned that there could be players in the ecosystem who might make a “timing error” or could see “bad things” happen when it comes to the economic payoffs. “There’s an inherent risk when the timing of the economic value is uncertain,” Amodei explained. He said companies had to take risks to compete with each other and authoritarian adversaries — a reference to the threat from China — but added that some players were not “managing that risk well, who are taking unwise risks.” The issue, he said, is the uncertainty around how quickly the economic value of AI will grow and properly mapping that to the lag times on building more data centers. “There’s [a] genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,” Amodei said. “And then I think there are some players who are ‘YOLO-ing,’ who pull the risk dial too far, and I’m very concerned,” he added, using the slang term for “you only live once,” which is often used to justify risk-taking. Plus, he spoke to the question around AI chips’ deprecation timelines . That’s another hot-button topic and a factor that could negatively impact the industry’s economics if GPUs become obsolete and lose their value ahead of schedule. “The issue isn’t the lifetime of the chips — chips keep working for a long time.

Musk replied to another user who had noticed the newest update to the software, known as FSD, was not flashing a warning as he used his phone while driving. The Tesla CEO wrote the update allows it “depending on context of surrounding traffic.” Musk didn’t offer any details, and Tesla does not have a PR team that can provide more information. Musk didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Nearly all 50 states have banned texting while driving, and around half of states have made any handheld phone usage while driving illegal, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Despite Musk’s perpetual hype, FSD is still a driver-assistance system that does not make Tesla’s vehicles fully autonomous. Drivers initially needed to have their hands on the wheel even when FSD was engaged. That requirement was later removed and allowed drivers to have hands off as long as the in-cabin camera detected they were paying attention to the road. FSD uses a mix of in-cabin camera and steering wheel sensors to monitor a driver’s attentiveness. And because FSD is just driver-assistance software, and not full autonomy, drivers need to be ready to take control of the vehicle if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. This handover of control is often a major component of crashes that involve the use of driver-assistance systems. Musk himself has in the past said that Autopilot, the driver-assistance system that comes standard in all Teslas, sometimes made drivers too complacent and confident.

Investors love to ask, “What’s your competitive advantage?” Usually they’re talking about moats, IP, and defensibility. But before you ever write a line of code, you already have assets: your background, your experiences, your reputation, your network. Most founders simply forget to treat those as strategic tools. As the saying goes, “if you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.” Be intentional about who you surround yourself with, build a focused network, and share your unique expertise boldly. This week, Isabelle sits down with Kyle Rudolph and Jon Walburg , co-founders of Alltroo , a fundraising platform that transforms celebrity access into once-in-a-lifetime charitable sweepstakes, from swimming with Michael Phelps to Oktoberfest at Arnold Schwarzenegger’s house. Kyle and Jon’s story shows that while celebrity status can open doors, it’s the execution, trust, and authenticity behind the company that keeps those doors open. Their credibility — rooted in Kyle’s career with the Minnesota Vikings, co-founder Jason Zucker’s career with the Buffalo Sabres, Jon’s operator background, and the early crowdfunding success that inspired their model — forms a powerful foundation of founder-market fit that’s hard to copy. Their pivot from exclusive $10,000 golf events to accessible $10 sweepstakes demonstrates how democratizing access can actually elevate prestige when done with intention.

Again.", "content": "Harvey on Thursday confirmed it closed a round of funding, led by Andreessen Horowitz, that values the legal AI startup at $8 billion after reports of the funding leaked in October . The startup raised $160 million in the round. This latest capital infusion came just months after it raised $300 million in a Series E round at a $5 billion valuation in June. And that was just months after raising a Sequoia-led $300 million Series D at a $3 billion valuation in February. Harvey’s investors include EQT, WndrCo, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Sarah Guo’s Conviction, and Elad Gil. In September, just before raising this latest mega round, Harvey released some details about its business. While it declined to share any absolute numbers, just percentages of growth and retention (it later told TechCrunch that it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue back in August), it said that it counts 50 of the top AmLaw 100 firms as its customers. It also serves corporate legal teams. As an industry entirely based on words, it makes sense that legal functions would be a perfect use case for LLMs: searching, summarizing, and drafting, all based on domain-specific training. But Harvey is also one of the best examples of how VCs are “kingmaking” these days . That involves pouring vast sums of money into a startup to signal how solid it is, which encourages large enterprise customers, like law firms, to sign big contracts in a self-fulfilling prophecy. Given that Harvey was founded in 2022, it may be far enough ahead of competitors — both in customer acquisition and the reinforced training from working with so many law firms — that it is the king of this market. At least, one of its long-time VCs, Elad Gil, thinks so. Gil told TechCrunch that Harvey is one of the AI market leaders that is experiencing bona fide growth because its tech and market position are “just working.” Harvey’s founder and CEO Winston Weinberg recently told TechCrunch’s editor-in-chief Connie Loizos an incredible", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/legal-ai-startup-harvey-confirms-8b-valuation/", "timestamp": 1764952782.7037516}

On Thursday, Amnesty and a coalition of media partners, including Israeli newspaper Haaretz , Greek news site Inside Story , and Swiss outlet Inside IT , published a series of reports based on leaked material from Intellexa, including internal company documents, sales and marketing material, and training videos. Perhaps the most striking revelation is that people working at Intellexa could allegedly remotely access the surveillance systems of at least some of its customers via TeamViewer, an off-the-shelf tool that allows users to connect to other computers over the internet. The remote access is shown in a leaked training video revealing privileged parts of the Predator spyware system, including its dashboard, as well as the “storage system containing photos, messages and all other surveillance data gathered from victims of the Predator spyware,” Amnesty wrote in its report. (Amnesty published screenshots taken from the video, but not the full video.) The nonprofit researchers wrote that the leaked video shows apparent “live” Predator infection attempts “against real targets,” based on detailed information “from at least one infection attempt against a target in Kazakhstan.” The video contained the infection URL, the target’s IP address, and the software versions of the target’s phone. Companies that sell spyware to government agencies, such as NSO Group and the now-defunct Hacking Team, have long maintained that they never have access to the data of their customers’ targets, nor their customers’ systems. There are several reasons why. From the point of view of the spyware makers, they don’t want the potential legal liability if their customers use the spyware unlawfully.

Amazon says it features a new texture-molded glass to improve the friction when the pen glides across the screen to make it feel like you’re writing on paper. The device also comes with a new quad-core chip, more memory, and the company’s latest Oxide display technology to make everything feel smoother. There are two versions of the Kindle Scribe, one with a front light system and one without. Kindle Scribe with a front light will be available on December 10 starting at $499.99. The version without a front light will be available early next year for $429.99. As for the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft, Amazon says it features display technology that creates colors that are soft and don’t hurt your eyes like an LCD display. The company also developed a new rendering engine that enhances the color and ensures writing is fast and natural. Plus, the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft provides weeks of battery life, Amazon notes. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft will be available on December 10 starting at $629.99. The devices feature a new Home experience that lets users jot something down, and open recently opened and added books, documents, and notebooks. Amazon anticipates both devices being used for handwritten notes, and the devices include significant product integrations to enhance that experience. One feature will let users search their notes across their notebooks and get simple AI summaries.

Three founders discuss what it takes.", "content": "Julie Bornstein thought it would be a cinch to implement her idea for an AI startup . Her résumé in digital commerce is impeccable: VP of ecommerce at Nordstrom, COO of the startup Stitch Fix, and founder of a personalized shopping platform acquired by Pinterest . Fashion has been her obsession since she was a Syracuse high schooler inhaling spreads in Seventeen and hanging out in local malls. So she felt well-positioned to create a company for customers to discover the perfect garments using AI. The reality was much harder than she expected. I had breakfast recently with Bornstein and her CTO, Maria Belousova, to learn about her startup, Daydream , funded with $50 million from VCs like Google Ventures. The conversation took an unexpected turn as the women schooled me on the surprising difficulty of translating the magic of AI systems into something people actually find useful.T Her story helps explain something. My first newsletter of 2025 announced that it would be The Year of the AI App . Though there are indeed many such apps, they haven’t transformed the world as I anticipated. Ever since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, people have been blown away by the tricks performed by AI, but study after study has shown that the technology has not yet delivered a significant boost in productivity. (One exception: coding.) A study published in August found that 19 out of 20 AI enterprise pilot projects delivered no measurable value. I do think that productivity boost is on the horizon, but it’s taking longer than people expected. Listening to the stories of startups like Daydream that are pushing to break through gives some hope that persistence and patience might indeed make those breakthroughs happen. Bornstein’s original pitch to VCs seemed obvious: Use AI to solve tricky fashion problems by matching customers with the perfect garments, which they’d be delighted to pay for.

It's why you should always have lube within reach . Lube is a sexually active person’s best friend.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

Some of it is entirely AI-generated, while other users have taken to editing their posts and comments with AI programs like Grammarly. “It’s probably more prevalent than anybody wants to really admit, because it’s just so easy to shove your post into ChatGPT and say ‘Hey, make this more exciting,’” says Cassie, who thinks as much as half of all content being posted to Reddit may have been created or reworked with AI in some way. r/AmItheAsshole is a pillar of Reddit culture, a format that has inspired dozens if not hundreds of derivatives like r/AmIOverreacting, r/AmITheDevil, and r/AmItheKameena, a subreddit with over 100,000 members described as “Am I the asshole, but the Indian version.” Posts tend to feature stories about interpersonal conflicts, where Redditors can weigh in on who is wrong (“YTA” means “You’re the asshole,” while “ESH” means “Everyone sucks here”), who is right, and what the best course of action to take is moving forward.

(2025)", "summary": "Optimize your sauna session by listening to the experts and, more importantly, your body.", "content": "Whether it’s post-workout or as part of a spa day, a sauna session can relax and enhance wellness. The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1764952784.696852}

The “overwhelming majority” of the images involved nudity and were “depicted adult content,” according to the researcher who uncovered the exposed trove of data, with some appearing to depict children or the faces of children swapped onto the AI-generated bodies of nude adults. Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos.

As a company that puts sexual pleasure front and center, Womanizer has continued to add to their very impressive lineup of orgasm-inducing toys. They’ve even branched out by creating products like the Womanizer Duo and Womanizer Duo 2 , both of which stimulate the clitoris and G-spot simultaneously. (Blended orgasm, anyone?) As recently as March 2025, Womanizer launched their latest toy, Womanizer Enhance , the first toy of its kind because it allows the user to choose between the Pleasure Air Technology or traditional vibrations. I was fortunate enough to review the Enhance for WIRED, giving it a 7/10 because of its ability to stand by its word and deliver me one heck of an orgasm. But because the Enhance is just one of dozens of Womanizer products that have hit the market in the last 11 years, I’m the first to admit that it can be difficult to choose which one is best for you.

The outside general counsel for USIP, he’s been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump’s right to remove them from office.

Boomers, Hogg said, are likely the group most out of touch with their generation in Washington, DC. “You know why I say that?” Hogg said. “It's because the people that are marching by the millions right now in the No Kings Day protests are not young people. They are people of Chuck Schumer's generation that are extremely pissed off with him.” Hogg’s Schumer slams weren’t the only anti-boomer jabs he threw during his talk, likening the current makeup of Congress to the “end of the Soviet Union” when he said “leaders were dying over and over because they were so old,” and complaining about the establishment leadership in the Democratic National Committee , where Hogg was vice chair until a recent shake-up. While Hogg did concede that “there are plenty of great boomers out there,” he said part of what he’s working on as the cofounder of the group Leaders We Deserve is a shift in elected officials’ age and political focus. “What we want to do with Leaders We Deserve is not just elect younger versions of who's already there,” said Hogg. “We want to elect younger people that have the chance to actually have integrity, support them with millions of dollars, ensure that they don't take money from corporations, for example, [and ask] th", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-david-hogg/", "timestamp": 1764952785.6060867}

Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs.

Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should.

Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work.

The IG first shared the classified report with Congress on Tuesday. The report contains only one direct recommendation: that the chief of US Central Command's Special Security Office “review the command’s classification procedures for compliance” with Department of Defense regulations “and issue additional procedures, as necessary, to ensure proper portion marking of classified information.” The report also references another IG publication about use of “non–DOD-controlled electronic messaging systems” and points to its recommendations that DOD “improve training for senior DOD officials on the proper use of electronic devices.” The incident the inspector general was investigating has been called Signalgate , because top US officials were using the mainstream platform for communications that would typically occur through secure government channels. Crucially, then-US national security adviser Michael Waltz accidentally invited journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's top editor, to the Signal chat as well. Goldberg subsequently publicized the existence of the chat and his mistaken inclusion—illustrating in real time some of the dangers of using a consumer app for highly secret government and military business. Meanwhile, in addition to extremely specific information about the strike, including details like the timing of bomb drops, Hegseth messaged the chat at one point, “We are currently clean on opsec,” referring to operations security .

At WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday—not so coincidentally held in San Francisco—the mayor told global editorial director Katie Drummond that he’s absolutely convinced that anyone looking to rag on the city doesn’t know what they’re talking about. Of course, Lurie said, things could always be better. While he hailed positive changes that San Francisco has made since he took office 11 months ago, like more office space being filled in the downtown area and a decrease in crime, he acknowledged that some of that might have come in the wake of companies’ return-to-office policies and the AI boom. Still, Lurie said, if you ask San Francisco residents, 62 percent say that their city is headed in the right direction, compared to just 25 percent a year ago. Lurie said part of what’s going to help keep San Francisco on the right track is a commitment from residents. Past leaders, he said, “took San Francisco for granted,” thinking “we could just continue on, and our success would continue as well.” To make San Francisco resilient, able to weather economic changes and tech booms and busts, Lurie said, its leaders have to be “relentless in fighting for [their] city, standing up for [their] city, and welcoming people, saying, ‘We want you here, and we're going to create the conditions for your success.’” But while San Francisco is often cited as a city for the ultra-rich—like the tech CEOs who have lobbied for the city in Washington and like the mayor himself, who has a connection to the Levi Strauss fortune—Lurie said he wants to push toward making his city more affordable, stressing that he wants kids who are born in San Francisco today to be able to live comfortably in the city for the rest of their lives.

But prices won’t drop for years, and consumers will spend more on gas in the meantime.", "content": "The Trump administration says its proposal to roll back vehicle fuel economy standards, announced officially in the Oval Office on Wednesday, is an attempt to shave dollars off the ballooning cost of new cars in the US. But the intended price drops likely won’t show up on dealership lots and showroom floors for months if not years, given the length of automakers’ product planning schedule. It would also likely force Americans to pay more, long-term, at another place they tend to visit more frequently: the pump. The proposal from the US Department of Transportation would require automakers to reach a fleet-wide average of 34.5 miles per gallon by model year 2031, down from the 50.4-miles-per-gallon benchmark set by the Biden administration. (The Biden-era rules called for a 49-miles-per-gallon average in 2026.) The department estimates the change could save US auto buyers around $1,000 per car, adding up to $109 billion over the next five years. New vehicles now cost more than $49,000 on average, according to Edmunds. The government will accept public comments on the proposal through mid-January. It could be finalized sometime next year. The rollback is part of a larger federal about-face on not only auto policy, but the government’s attitude on climate change. The Biden administration took a carrot-and-stick approach to vehicles and their effect on the environment. Light-duty cars and trucks alone are responsible for some 15 percent of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. The previous administration tried to boost electric vehicle adoption by using tax subsidies for consumers and manufacturers interested in building fuel-efficient vehicles and technologies, including batteries. It also introduced penalties for those unable or unwilling to meet stricter environmental standards. Automakers should be able to hit next decade’s goals by selling more electric vehicles, the government then reasoned.

That’s when women are supposed to start getting mammograms and men are supposed to start paying a bit more attention to their prostates. Over the next decade, you’ll start getting colonoscopies, and from then on out, it feels like a gradual march of doctor’s appointments and tests until your body collapses sometime in your seventies or eighties. But what if modern medicine has the timeline all wrong? What if we’re testing some middle-aged people unnecessarily for diseases they’ll most likely never get, while blindly ignoring twentysomethings who might be prone to colon cancer? Is there a way that, even as we age, we can stay healthy in a way that’s both meaningful and not reliant on taking 12 horse-sized pills every morning? Eric Topol certainly thinks so. The cardiologist, vice president of Scripps Research, and author of Super Agers is convinced that new innovations in AI-assisted medicine, bioengineering, and anti-inflammatory awareness could have potential to revolutionize the way people age. During WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday, Topol told features editor Sandra Upson that while he was working on Super Agers he learned that there’s a difference between lifespan and health span and that neither has much to do with genetics. Someone who’s “wellderly,” or over 65 and generally healthy, has pretty much the same genetic makeup as someone who’s elderly and facing major health challenges, like heart disease, cancer, or a neurodegenerative disorder. Instead, Topol said, there appears to be a correlation between having a healthy immune system and aging healthily.

The action comes after the company announced a Content Independence Day in July—an initiative with prominent publishers and AI firms to block AI crawlers by default on content creators’ work unless the AI companies pay for access. Since July 2024, Cloudflare has offered customers tools to block AI bots from scraping their content. Cloudflare told WIRED that the number of AI bots blocked since July 1, 2025 is 416 billion. “The business model of the internet has always been to generate content that drives traffic [to a website] and then sell either things, subscriptions, or ads,” Prince told WIRED’s executive editor, Brian Barrett. “What I think people don't realize, though, is that AI is a platform shift. The business model of the internet is about to change dramatically.

It might seem shocking to see a crash-test dummy flying through a car window in a video, but learning that an automaker updated their vehicle’s safety features as a result of that test could sell a buyer on a car. Amodei said the same goes for companies using Anthropic’s AI products, making for a market that is somewhat self-regulating. “We’re setting what you can almost think of as minimum safety standards just by what we’re putting into the economy,” she said.

Chu . At WIRED’s Big Interview event in San Francisco, the onetime YouTuber and Crazy Rich Asians director said that working with acts like Justin Bieber taught him the value of connecting with fans online during the creation process. While directing Bieber’s concert film, Never Say Never , in the late aughts, Chu said the then-14-year-old star used Twitter to introduce Chu to fans. After Bieber posted a clip joking that the director was following him around on set, Chu told WIRED’s senior culture editor, Manisha Krishnan, he began to watch his online followers grow by tens of thousands of people almost instantly, something that really drove home the power of direct connection with a fan base. Working with Bieber, Chu said, made him realize that “the story is being told before you even start shooting, and after you’re done with the movie, you have to continue that story.” That’s why he believes fans have felt so invested in Wicked —and its sequel, Wicked: For Good —and why the movie’s marketing and press tours have leaned so heavily on the relationships built by the cast while filming. Bonds, like the one between stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, came from the immense pressure the crew felt to make something not only great but also bankable. “We only had each other, so we’re very, very bonded,” Chu said, likening the relationship to that of Silicon Valley developers working long hours together to deliver a new product. A Bay Area native, Chu said he has always felt partially indebted to the tech world for his start in entertainment. In the ’90s, when Chu was just a teenager, tech-minded customers at his parents’ Chinese restaurant would slip him computers, video cards, and software when they heard he was interested in filmmaking, giving him a leg up on fellow students when he went to college at the University of Southern California. “I was built by the gen", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-jon-chu-wicked/", "timestamp": 1764952786.9606013}

Authorities identified the man as Brian J. Cole Jr., a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. The arrest marks a major break in a case that has vexed authorities for nearly five years. Cole, 30, is charged with transporting an explosive device across state lines with the intent to kill, injure, intimidate, or destroy property and with attempting to damage and destroy the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic national committees by means of an explosive device. If convicted, he would face the prospect of decades in prison. According to an affidavit , investigators linked Cole to the bombs through a combination of surveillance footage, historical cell-site data, and years of purchase records showing he bought each major component used to construct the devices. Agents allege Cole acquired the same model of galvanized pipe, matching end caps, and nine-volt connectors, among other items, across multiple hardware stores in northern Virginia in 2019 and 2020. Cole continued buying components used in bomb-making after his bombs in the Capitol were discovered, agents allege, listing the purchase of a white kitchen timer and two nine-volt batteries from a Walmart on January 21, as well as galvanized pipes from Home Depot the following day. Senior Trump administration officials quickly cast the arrest as a vindication of their own leadership, claiming the case had gone cold. Attorney General Pam Bondi said she hoped the arrest would restore public trust following what she characterized as a “total lack of movement” on a case that had “languished for four years.” In their telling, the breakthrough was proof that the case only advanced once they were empowered to “go get the bad guys” and stop “focusing on other extraneous things,” as FBI deputy director Dan Bongino put it. “Though it had been nearly five ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-says-dc-pipe-bomb-suspect-brian-cole-kept-buying-bomb-parts-after-jan-6/", "timestamp": 1764952787.2488496}

Today, when Su took the stage at WIRED’s Big Interview conference in San Francisco, she had something else in her sights: the AI bubble . When asked by WIRED senior writer Lauren Goode if the tech industry is in an AI bubble, her response was “emphatically, from my perspective, no.” The AI industry is going to need scores of chips from companies like AMD, and fears of such a bubble, Su said, are “somewhat overstated.” That might sound bold, but boldness is Su’s whole deal.

Now, Su is betting big on the need for much more computing power for AI, and the data centers needed to provide that. Still, there are plenty of hurdles ahead for AMD. One is all of those data centers being built, and another is getting its chips out into the hands of as many customers as possible.

The US government previously halted sales of the chips to China, but then began reviewing applications again over the summer.

If your phone’s not magnetic, the product ships with an adhesive magnetic ring that you can apply to your device. The T10 contains a processor that powers a GPT-4.1 -trained language model and supports over 150 languages, although the number is inflated as many are minor regional variants of common languages like Spanish and English. The device is self-contained, but it must connect via Bluetooth to your phone (and from there to the internet) for most of the heavy lifting. In fact, while the system touts an offline mode, the company says it won’t be activated until sometime in December. For now, the T10 can’t do anything if you don’t have an active internet connection. InnAIO AI Translator T10 Rating: 5/10 While the T10 hardware is simple, the InnAIO Pro app is anything but.

While DJI's continual stream of steadily improving, ever-reliable drones almost always impresses, what Antigravity has done with its first-ever product, the A1 , essentially invents an entirely novel subcategory: the 360 drone. Using the same shoot-first, frame-later technology as the Insta360 X5 (Antigravity is technically a distinct company from Insta360, but the brands have close ties ), the A1 has twin cameras to capture everything around it, allowing the user to reframe the footage later using mobile or desktop apps. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 Each of the cameras uses a 1/1.28-inch sensor and an ultrawide lens to capture a hemispherical view. In-camera software then joins the two views into a near-seamless single spherical video, completely removing the drone and its propellers from view (in much the same way Insta360's cameras remove a selfie stick). The 360-degree clips can be as high as 8K and 30 frames per second in resolution, but 5.2K and 4K options are available for users requiring 60 fps or 100 fps frame rates. When output to a standard \"flat\" video, however, the resolution is limited to 4K or 1080p. The camera performs best in bright, clear conditions, and while there's noticeable softening and motion noise in certain parts of the image, getting great-looking clips out of it isn't difficult. Antigravity A1 Rating: 7/10 I think the output video looks very good for an aerial 360 camera, and it's clear that Insta360's know-how from making several generations of non-flying 360 cameras has been put to good use. The footage is easy to edit on both desktop and mobile apps, and although I preferred the former for its UI and the fine level of control it offers over scene trimming and image quality, I enjoyed the immediacy and AI-assisted highlight choices of the mobile app, too.

Zanskar, which uses AI to find hidden geothermal resources deep underground, says that it has identified a new commercially viable site for a potential power plant. The discovery, the company claims, is the first of its kind made by the industry in decades. The find is the culmination of years of research on how to find these resources—and points to the growing promise of geothermal energy . “When we started this company, I think the most common message we heard was that geothermal was dead—it was a history of bones, a graveyard of so many failures,” says Carl Hoiland, a cofounder of Zanskar. “To get to this point where, thanks to these new tools and these new capabilities, you can systematically find these sites and systematically derisk them—we just think this is the first full-scale signal that the tide has turned.” In theory, geothermal power is one of the simplest methods of generating renewable energy. Reservoirs of hot water underground, heated by the Earth’s core, produce steam that can then be used to power turbines at the surface, requiring no excessive mining or complex conversions of fuel. Geothermal resources are especially accessible in areas where tectonic plates meet and the Earth’s crust is thinner, making the western US a great candidate for power plants. The world’s largest developed geothermal field, in California, is built on the site of hot springs that humans have used for thousands of years; the first power plant was built there in the early 1920s . But a big part of the geothermal puzzle is actually finding these resources. It’s rare to find hot springs or vents at the surface that lead to a productive spot to put a power plant. Most geothermal systems that are hot enough to make electricity are deep underground, and there is no evidence at the surface. These are known as hidden or blind systems—and identifying where they are is surprisingly challengin", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/startup-found-hidden-source-geothermal-energy/", "timestamp": 1764952788.096071}

Also known as shooting stars, meteors happen when Earth’s orbital path crosses a path of debris left by a comet and that material burns up in the Earth’s atmosphere. Watching a meteor shower is one of the most accessible ways to engage with the night sky. The next shower are the Geminids, a busy and bright shower that peaks in mid-December, offering the chance to see hundreds of shooting stars each hour. This is just one of nine major meteor showers that grace skies throughout the year, and details of when they will appear in the northern hemisphere are listed below—so mark your 2026 calendar for these. You don’t need any special equipment to see a meteor shower—in fact, using devices like binoculars or telescopes actually prevents you from seeing meteors, because they travel too fast to be seen through the lenses of such equipment. All you need are your eyes, a dark sky with little to no moonlight, and a location that’s away from excess light, as moonlight and light pollution can wash out shooting stars. Note that the moon appears (rises) and disappears (sets) in the night sky at different times depending on what time zone you are in. All moonrise/moonset times in this piece are for the eastern US. You can use tools like Time and Date’s moonrise/moonset calendar or this tool from the US Naval Observatory to check the precise moonrise/moonset times in your exact location. You should allow your eyes about half an hour to adjust to the darkness. If you need to use a flashlight while outside, use one with red light instead of white to preserve your night vision. Each meteor shower is named after its radiant, or the constellation that the shower appears to come from. A meteor shower’s radiant usually needs to be above the horizon before you can see the meteors.

WIRED has made this article free for all to read because it is primarily based on reporting from Freedom of Information Act requests. Please consider subscribing to support our journalism . According to the documents, LDWF signed a memorandum of agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in May, which gives the wildlife agency the authority to detain people suspected of immigration violations and to transfer them into ICE custody. Since then, at least six men entered ICE custody after coming into contact with or being detained by LDWF officers. None of the men were issued criminal charges at the time they came into contact with LDWF officers, the documents show. Two of the men were known by ICE to have been in the country legally at the time the agency took them into custody. The documents also indicate that at least one “joint patrol” took place in a Louisiana wildlife management area in which LDWF agents were accompanied by officers with Customs and Border Protection and the US Coast Guard. The memorandum of agreement between ICE and LDWF makes no mention of CBP or the possibility of working with the agency as part of the agreement. However, the documents indicate that a relationship with CBP may have been facilitated through LDWF’s partnership with ICE. LDWF partnered with ICE under the agency’s 287(g) program, named after the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that enables officers and employees at the state or local level to perform some of the functions of US immigration officers, such as investigating, apprehending, detaining, or transporting people suspected of violating immigration law.

The iX3 is the first of six cars based on BMW’s much-trailed new modular EV platform, the “ Neue Klasse ,” that arrives with new motors, new inverters, new batteries, new charging tech, new interior display wizardry, and, perhaps most importantly, a fancy new central computer brain designed to make these latest electric Beemers drive better than anything on the road right now. The Neue Klasse range uses the sixth generation of BMW eDrive tech, boasting “ cell-to-pack ” batteries with liquid-cooled cylindrical cells consisting of higher nickel and less cobalt content for a 20-percent bump in energy density. A lighter 800-volt electric architecture boosts charging speeds by a third, and at up to 400 kilowatts. This means 200 miles can be added in just 10 minutes in ideal conditions.

In response, digital and human rights organization Fight for the Future is hosting a week of events —across Reddit , LinkedIn, and various livestreams —to raise awareness of how it believes these bills are setting a dangerous precedent by making the internet more exploitative rather than safer. Many of the proposed bills include a clause for ID or age verification, which forces people to upload an ID, allow a face scan, or otherwise authenticate that they are not a minor before viewing adult content. Fight for the Future says the policies will lead to increased censorship and surveillance. Among the 19 bills considered at the hearing conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee was the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which passed with sweeping bipartisan approval in the Senate last year, and the Reducing Exploitative Social Media Exposure for Teens Act , which would ban tech companies from allowing minors under the age of 16 on their platforms. In addition to age verification, the bills raised concerns over issues of parental controls, consumer research of minors, AI, and data privacy. “We’re seeing this huge wave toward ID checks being the norm in tech policy, and it felt like we needed to capture the already activated communities who are not feeling heard in Congress,” says Sarah Philips, a campaigner with Fight for the Future. “If you look on YouTube, if you see people making content about KOSA or responding to a lot of this legislation, it’s very unpopular with people. But it’s viewed on the Hill as very common-sense.” Missouri’s age-gate law took effect earlier this week, meaning 25 US states have passed a form of age verification.

This could have implications far outside gaming.", "content": "The video game Valorant , a fast-paced team-based shooter , has recently become a testing ground for a promising new direction in artificial intelligence research. The game’s developers at Riot Games (a Tencent subsidiary) are using 3D-native AI models to prototype new characters, scenes, and storylines, according to a researcher familiar with the company’s efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity. While many AI models can generate text, images, and video, Tencent’s Hunyuan (混元 or “first mix”) family of models can dream up 3D objects and interactive scenes. The source says that Tencent’s models are also being used by the developers of another Tencent game, GKART , and by some independent developers, too. Tencent declined to comment. “The games industry requires a lot of investment,” the source says. “Previously you would need a month to design a character. Now you can just type in some text, and Hunyuan can give you four choices in 60 seconds.” The news is an early signal that models capable of understanding and re-creating the physical world could become a standard ingredient in game design. In addition to generating game content, these models could also enable more advanced virtual and augmented reality and help robots learn to do new things. “There’s a real explosion of 3D vision research nowadays,” says Alexander Raistrick , a graduate student at Princeton University working on novel approaches to generating 3D content. “There are many killer applications: There's content creation, there’s self driving, and there’s a whole stack of problems involved in augmented reality.” Raistrick adds that video games are an obvious application for 3D AI models. “Outputting 3D meshes [a standard way of representing 3D objects] is your typical kind of bread and butter of game development,” he says.

On December 4, Earth's satellite will delight us with one of the last astronomical spectacles of 2025. Not only will it be the last full moon of the year, but it's also a cold moon—which refers to the frigid temperatures typical of this time of year—and, finally, a supermoon . Here's how and when best to enjoy this spectacle of the year-end sky. The term supermoon refers to a full moon that occurs when our satellite is at perigee, the point at which its orbit brings it closest to our planet. (The moon's orbit is elliptical, and its distance from Earth varies between about 407,000 km at apogee, the point of maximum distance, and about 380,000 at perigee.) In addition to being the third consecutive supermoon of the year, as reported by EarthSky , it will be about 357,000 km away from us, making it the second-closest full Moon of the year. Consequently it will also be the second-largest and brightest. Although most of us won't notice any difference in size compared to a normal full moon (it appears up to 8 percent larger to us), its brightness could exceed that of an ordinary full Moon by 16 percent. This time, moreover, it will be 100 percent illuminated just 12 hours after its perigee. In addition to its name, which refers to the cold temperatures of this period, December's full moon will be the last of 12 full moons in 2025 and the highest of the year. With the winter solstice approaching on December 21, the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, so the full moon is at its highest point. In other words, this means that the super cold moon will be particularly high in the sky. As EarthSky points out, however, it is not the closest full Moon to the December 21 solstice. While it occurs 17 days before, the first full moon of 2026 will occur on January 3—just 12 days after the solstice. That will be the fourth and last consecutive supermoon.

It’s a Shit Show", "summary": "The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport, even offering money. But some immigrants say it’s been nearly impossible.", "content": "A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport . The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained. CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims. Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure.

Well, Who Do You Know?", "summary": "AI-powered startup Fortell has become a secret handshake for the privileged hearing-impaired crowd who swear by the product. Now, it wants to be in your ears.", "content": "A secret is percolating at dinner parties, salons, and cocktail gatherings among the august New York City elite. It’s whispered in the circles of financial masters of the universe, Hollywood stars, and owners of sports teams. Have you heard about Fortell? Many haven’t—or if they did hear, they might not have made out the words through noisy cross-conversations. Once they do know—particularly if they’re boomers—they want it desperately. Fortell is a hearing aid, one that claims to use AI to provide a dramatically superior aural experience. The chosen few included in its beta test claim that it seems to top the performance of high-end devices they’d been unhappily using. These testers have made pilgrimages to Fortell’s headquarters on the fifth floor of a WeWork facility in New York City’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, where they were fitted for the hearing aids—which from the outside look pretty much like standard, over-the-ear, teardrop-shaped devices. But the big moment comes when a Fortell staffer takes them down to street level. There, among street clatter, honking cabs, and delivery trucks backing up to luxury stores, they are asked to conduct a conversation with a Fortell worker. Two other employees stand behind them, adding their own loud discourse to the urban cacophony. Despite the din, the testers clearly make out what the person in front of them is saying. The clouds lift. Angels croon. “This was so incredible that I burst into tears,” says Ashley Tudor, one of the seemingly few beta testers who isn’t famous or powerful (though she is married to a venture capitalist). Meryl Hartzband has her hearing tested by audiologist Kathleen Wallace at Fortell in late November. Among the age-related-hearing-loss set, getting into the Fortell beta test has become a weird status symbol, the aural-prosthetics version of a limited-edition Birkin bag. “This product has become a major flex for the post-70 set,” says one investor.

These smart displays can stream your favorite shows, join a video call, and even double as a digital photo frame.", "content": "Best Buy Amazon Amazon Amazon Smart Displays are pretty darn handy. As a visual learner, I prefer to ask my smart displays what the weather is so I can see it as I hear it, lest I immediately forget. Smart displays also give you many more capabilities, from following along with an onscreen recipe to making video calls or streaming movies, and even just easily scrubbing through a song to reach your favorite part. We've tested most of the major displays, and our favorite overall is the Google Nest Hub Max , which doubles nicely as a digital photo frame. If you're more of an Alexa user, the best of Amazon's massive lineup is the new Echo Show 11, which has a brighter screen and is made for Amazon's new Alexa+ assistant, but the third-generation Echo Show 8 is the best performance for the price in Amazon's ecosystem. Looking for a little bit of visual info without all the clutter or a camera? The Echo Spot is a fun partial display. Be sure to check out our many other buying guides , including the Best Smart Speakers , Best Google Assistant Speakers, and Best Alexa Speakers .

It has an unobtrusive design, a 10-inch touchscreen display, some pretty good speakers, and a camera for video calls over Google Duo. (Google ditched broader support for Google Meet and Zoom .) It makes for an easy digital photo frame, too, if you use Google Photos, and is easily the best photo frame and smart display combo on the market. I love how big the 10-inch screen is to follow recipes or adjust the lights on around the house, and to check the video feed when my Nest doorbell rings.

The synthetic opioid is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence. It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?” Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was recognized even then , and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl. Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a 24 percent decline in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there. But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name.

Major) — who has been detained in the UAE since September 2024. The order asks the MEA to appoint a nodal officer and use any practical channels, including the TAMM app, to enable communication between siblings. Posting a family photo on social media, Celina wrote: “Ma & Pa… I’m doing my best! I haven’t spoken to Vikrant in 15 months. Today, hope was placed on record… Thank you, Universe!!” Her petition had demanded access and legal representation for her brother, whom she says was “abducted and detained” in the UAE on September 6, 2024. The MEA has reportedly filed its status report and appointed a nodal officer to coordinate with her for access. While she still hasn’t been able to speak to Vikrant, the court was informed that’s the government’s aim. Celina added that she is “grateful to the Additional Solicitor General, the Court, and everyone who recognised our family’s four generations of service to the Indian Armed Forces.” She asked media to direct further queries to her legal counsel and said the next hearing is scheduled for December 23. The hearing on December 4, 2025, led to a directive from Justice Sachin Datta directing the MEA to ensure Celina is able to contact her brother. The ministry must designate a nodal officer, liaise with UAE authorities or consular contacts, and use available communication platforms — including the TAMM app — to make that happen. The court emphasised maintaining regular updates to the family, and the next hearing is set for December 23, 2025. Vikrant Kumar Jaitly, a retired Indian Army major, has reportedly been detained in the UAE since September 2024. Celina’s petition alleged he was “abducted and detained”.

The Health Security se National Security Cess Bill 2025 was approved, allowing quick inclusion of similar products, with proceeds aimed at funding public health and national defense initiatives.", "content": "New Delhi: India's new tax regime for tobacco seeks to ensure that any new variants of pan masala —a category the Centre says is highly prone to tax evasion—can be brought under the proposed Health Security Se National Security cess in future, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha on Friday. The measure aims to check tax evasion, while ensuring a steady funding stream for public health and national defence as the goods and services tax (GST) compensation cess sunsets, the minister added. Replying to a house debate on the Health Security se National Security Cess Bill 2025, the minister said the government was also seeking Parliament’s nod to notify goods that are very similar to pan masala , without having to approach the house for that specific purpose again. To bypass higher taxes, manufacturers cuold well slip in new pan masala variants by tweaking ingredients, branding or formats. The government is seeking flexibility to quickly bring any such products under the cess as they emerge. At present, capacity-based taxation—deciding tax liability on disclosed production capacity rather than on actual production—is specified in the Bill only for pan masala, but it leaves the scope for the government to add more items to the list in future. The minister said such a mode of taxation could cover any other product similar to pan masala in the future, if such a need is felt. “There may be different variants of pan masala which may come up in future due to ingenuity of the industry. Those demerit goods should also be brought within the ambit of the levy. This would be notified by the Central government without the requirement of coming to Parliament every time,” the minister said, adding that the scope of such an addition is strictly limited to pan masala type products, not any other items. Sitharaman said the Centre's collection of cess, excluding the GST compensation cess, which was entirely used for states’ requirements, was 6.1% of the gross tax revenue ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/gst-cess-tobacco-pan-masala-lok-sabha-sitharaman-11764942576903.html", "timestamp": 1764952834.7355418}

Nita Ambani's jewellery paid homage to India's regal aesthetic and personal lineage. She accessorised her outfit with antique Kundan polki earrings over a century old, a handcrafted jadau bird ring from Swadesh, and a cherished haath phool passed down from her mother, a symbol of family heritage.

Kennedy Jr. The committee voted to continue the birth dose only for infants whose mothers test positive for hepatitis B, replacing the 1991 universal guideline that protected all children from potential liver infections. For babies of mothers who test negative, the panel recommended that parents, in consultation with their healthcare provider, decide when or if to begin the vaccine series. Under the scrapped universal recommendation, the birth dose was followed by two additional doses at 1–2 months and 6–18 months. The committee now suggests that if parents skip the birth dose, the first vaccine should be given no earlier than two months of age. Kennedy replaced 17 independent experts in June with a committee largely supportive of his views. During the two-day meeting, two members strongly opposed the change, arguing there was no evidence supporting it and highlighting decades of data on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness. Some committee members, who now include no immunologists, argued that studies on newborn safety were limited. The World Health Organization recommends that all infants receive the hepatitis B vaccine immediately after birth, followed by two or three doses at least four weeks apart. The WHO notes that 95% of infected newborns may develop chronic hepatitis B. The acting CDC director, Jim O’Neill, is expected to decide whether to accept the committee’s new recommendation.

The former celebratory mood has given way to concern and curiosity as fans were quick to notice that her engagement ring was missing. Her post was part of a paid campaign with a leading toothpaste brand, but what turned heads was not the ad — it was her bare ring finger. Social media erupted with speculation. Some users argued the video might have been shot before the engagement; others read into the absence of the ring as a sign of underlying tension. One fan commented, “The smile is back, (and the ring is gone) thankyou for this, that’s why Colgate.” Another user wrote, “Why it feels like she is sad ,she is smiling but her voice and her eyes looks she is sad and she is not wearing her engagement ring.” “Her voice yaar, that breaking one hurts bad 🥺 but so happy to see her doing this iv 😭♥️ and that ring is gone is all that we needed to know about it,” the third user wrote. “Where's the ring,” a user wrote on X.  Smriti and Palash’s wedding — set for 23 November in Sangli, Maharashtra — was called off at the eleventh hour when Smriti’s father, Srinivas Mandhana, suffered a sudden health emergency and was rushed to hospital. A day later, Palash too was admitted to hospital due to stress and exhaustion. While both have since been discharged, the families decided to delay the wedding indefinitely. Despite speculation online about a revised wedding date, Mandhana’s brother confirmed the marriage remains on hold. In light of the postponement, the couple also removed all pre-wedding and engagement-related posts from their social media, further adding to the uncertainty. Palash’s sister Palak Muchhal recently opened up about the emotional toll on both families. She said they’ve endured a “very tough time,” asking fans and media alike to treat the situation with sensitivity.

NEW DELHI: India’s drug regulator, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), plans to tighten rules on the sale and distribution of emergency contraceptive pills, including levonorgestrel formulations, sold under brand names such as Unwanted-72 and i-pill, and ulipristal pills sold as ella . The move, aimed at preventing habitual overuse and ensuring women have access to critical safety information, will require these pills to carry QR codes on their packaging, according to two officials and a document reviewed by Mint . The QR codes will link to detailed product information, including dosage, contraindications, drug interactions, side effects, storage instructions, and patient counselling guidance. Warnings will state that emergency contraceptives should not be used more than twice a month and do not protect against HIV or other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The measure follows similar government mandates for vaccines, antibiotics, and other essential medicines. The new QR-linked packaging will enhance traceability, curb misuse, and bridge the information gap, said Dr. Archana Dhawan Bajaj, a gynaecologist and IVF expert at Nurture in Delhi. “A major issue witnessed in clinical practice is that most women tend to take emergency contraceptive pills as a regular birth control method instead of a last resort,\" Bajaj said, warning that frequent use can lead to menstrual abnormalities and hormonal changes. “The suggested QR code can help explain safe usage.\" “Many women mistakenly believe these pills protect against STIs. QR-linked warnings can correct this and empower users with verified information,\" she added. Queries sent to the health ministry spokesperson, DCGI on Monday remained unanswered.

As large-scale operational disruptions continue for the fourth straight day, Goenka shared a spoof of the airline’s logo with a new name: “ItDidn’tGo”, taking a playful swipe at the ongoing cancellations and delays. The post quickly went viral, with many travellers saying the joke perfectly reflects their frustration. India’s largest airline has cancelled hundreds of services since earlier this week, stranding passengers at major hubs including Delhi, Bengaluru and Chennai, and pushing ticket prices for alternate flights to exorbitant levels. The anger online has been fuelled by real stories of travellers missing important commitments due to last-minute cancellations. Goenka’s post struck a chord with stranded flyers. “IndiGo going from IndiGo to ItDidn’tGo is wild 😂 Hope the next update is not a name change… but a timetable that actually works!” “When your flight history starts sounding like a plot twist — even the logo wants a rebrand.” “Sir, अगली बार अगर फ्लाइट delay हो जाए तो confidently कहेंगे — ItDidntGo.” “Harsh Goenka — the new stand-up comedian!” Many said the meme hit too close to home. The government and aviation regulator say the chaos stems from an unexpected pilot shortage linked to revised crew rest-duty rules under FDTL norms — stressing error-free planning was not put in place before rollout. IndiGo, which operates 2,300 flights daily, has seen punctuality collapse as cancellations ripple across its network. The DGCA has now approved temporary exemptions on specific pilot duty rules and ordered a review committee to assess the airline’s scheduling failures. The airline has promised automatic refunds for cancelled flights, while the Centre has directed carriers to also arrange hotel stays and alternate transport for stranded passengers.

Here's what happened.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "European Union regulators have fined Elon Musk-owned social media platform X (formerly Twitter) 120 million euros (USD 140 million) for failing to comply with the bloc's digital regulations. The European Commission announced its decision after conducting a comprehensive two-year investigation launched under the 27-nation bloc's Digital Services Act, during which regulators assessed X’s adherence to the bloc’s rules on illegal content, systemic risks and platform accountability. The Digital Services Act, which is also known as the DSA, is a sweeping rulebook designed to hold online platforms more accountable for the safety and integrity of their digital spaces. It requires companies to take proactive measures to protect European users, clean up harmful or illegal content and products on their sites. It also requires the sites to ensure transparency in how their algorithms work. The law gives regulators stronger enforcement powers, including the ability to impose hefty penalties on platforms that fail to meet these obligations, making non-compliance a costly risk for companies operating in the region. The Commission noted that it was punishing X, previously known as Twitter , because of three different violations of the law's transparency requirements, AP reported. However, the decision carries diplomatic risk, as it could rile President Donald Trump, whose administration has repeatedly criticised the digital regulations from Brussels and warned of retaliation if American tech companies are targeted with penalties. According to the regulators, the platform's blue checkmarks broke the law because of their “deceptive design” that could potentially expose X users to various scams and manipulation. X also fell short of the requirements for its ad database and giving access to researchers access to public data, AP reported. X was previously served with a formal warning last year, as European Union regulators claimed that it has failed to combat dangerous content.

On Reddit (r/india), user bootpalishAgain shared a harrowing experience after their late-night flight from Chennai to New Delhi was abruptly cancelled, forcing them to book a far costlier ticket to reach on time for an urgent family commitment. The user said they had booked the 8:30 pm Chennai–Delhi flight with IndiGo, only to receive a cancellation confirmation just hours before takeoff. Their brother’s engagement ceremony was scheduled for the next day in Delhi — and there was no option but to quickly rebook. Attempts to find flights with other carriers proved futile; listings on travel portals like Yatra had vanished almost entirely, and the few seats available on Air India were listed at a dramatically inflated price. “My 8.5k IndiGo flight that got cancelled forced me to buy a 71k Air India flight instead,” the user wrote. They lamented how “capitalists” were profiting from the sudden spike in fare, while IndiGo — embroiled in regulatory tussles with DGCA — offered only a refund with a 3-4 day wait. With the engagement an unavoidable obligation, the user called on fellow travellers and corporate travel managers to boycott IndiGo flights moving forward. This personal story comes against a backdrop of widespread chaos across IndiGo’s operations. As of Friday, all domestic flights departing from Delhi’s IGI Airport were cancelled till midnight, with similar shutdowns at major hubs like Bengaluru and Chennai. The disruptions — now lasting four straight days — have stranded thousands of passengers and seen fares skyrocket overnight.

Global talent migration has declined 8.5% year-over-year — the first drop since 2020 — but India has emerged as a notable exception to this trend, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report. In its new report titled “Global Talent Mobility Is Slowing and Shifting”, BCG reported that the global movement of highly skilled workers has fallen for the first time since 2020, with international mobility dropping 8.5% YoY — 220,000 fewer cross-border career moves.  However, the geography of global talent is shifting sharply, and India is defying the global slump.

He also said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had numerous warnings to the airline about the new system of working hours and rosters. The crisis at IndiGo stems from new regulations that boost pilots' weekly rest requirements by 12 hours to 48 and allow only two night-time landings per week, down from six. IndiGo has attributed the mass cancellations to \"misjudgment and planning gaps\". While talking to reporters, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said, “This is most unfortunate. As far as I understand, the DGCA had given plenty of warning to the airlines about the new system of working hours and rosters, etc. This meant the airlines had to hire more pilots, but clearly they failed to do so, inflicting chaos on the travelling public.” “The airline needs to do some serious introspection...They have let down the public,” Tharoor added.  IndiGo , the dominant player in India's domestic aviation sector, grounded over 500 flights nationwide on Friday, including a complete halt of all departures from New Delhi. The sweeping cancellations left thousands of air travellers stranded for extended periods, struggling to find alternative travel arrangements and lacking clear information. The root cause of the crisis was IndiGo's inadequate preparation for the implementation of new, more stringent flying-time regulations for pilots. This failure to adjust staffing and scheduling led to massive operational disruption, severely affecting passengers who reported missing critical events, including international connections, job interviews, and family functions like wedding receptions.

Anna Haakenson, a mother of two, spent two-and-a-half months exploring India — and says she expected differences, but did not realise how different everyday life would feel. In a popular Instagram post, Haakenson highlighted everything from food habits to family structures — sparking a lively discussion online. In America, honking signals anger; in India, it’s more like — “Hi, I’m here, please move”. “Spicy” in the US = mild heat. “Spicy” in India = may result in digestive adventures for foreigners. Haakenson says Americans may act like you don’t exist — but in India, people instantly want to know where you’re from and where you’re going. Bins in the US. Wherever is convenient, in many parts of India — according to her post. USA: Follow the rules, drive individually. India: A system of “controlled chaos” only locals understand. US: Four seasons. India: Hot, monsoon and ‘surprise extra heat’. Quiet churches in America vs. temples and festivals that can take over entire cities in India. Everything feels expensive in the US, she writes, but India felt far more affordable for daily life. Single-family homes in the US; multiple generations living together in India. Haakenson’s post has now crossed nearly four million views, with many Indians agreeing — and offering more points she “missed” about the country’s quirks and charm.

This marks the third consecutive day of flight chaos for the airline, triggering widespread anger online over delays, cancellations and lack of communication. Among those affected was Arun Prabhudesai, founder and CEO of Armoks Media, who posted a viral video on X (formerly Twitter) after his repeatedly delayed Pune–Delhi flight left passengers with no clear answers. Calling out the airline’s operations, he wrote: “SHAME ON YOU IndiGo6E. One of my biggest events of the year is in danger of getting cancelled because of your absolute incompetence… Every time we ask the crew if the flight will actually take off or get cancelled, there’s zero clarity. No answers, no accountability.” His flight, first scheduled for 1:05 pm, was pushed to 1:25 pm, then 3:30 pm, and eventually 6 pm. Prabhudesai claimed that the uncertainty put his major event — and lakhs spent on it — at risk. Several other passengers shared similar experiences online, with many pointing to severe crew shortages and new DGCA norms that have stalled operations. On Friday, IndiGo issued an apology to passengers impacted by disruptions on domestic flights departing from Delhi. The statement said: “We will ensure that all refunds of your cancellations will be processed automatically to your original mode of payment.”  The airline added that it has arranged thousands of hotel rooms across different cities, along with surface transport, to support stranded customers and minimise inconvenience. Some social media users, however, questioned why affected passengers were not exploring alternative travel options sooner. IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers separately acknowledged the crisis, saying the airline failed to deliver the experience it promises to its 380,000 daily flyers.

He emphasises the need for recognition and better working conditions for these 'invisible wheels' of the economy.", "content": "Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha on Friday urged Parliament to end what he termed the “cruelty” of 10-minute delivery services run by quick-commerce platforms. The Rajya Sabha MP said that this culture forces gig workers to risk their lives, compelling them to meet punishing deadlines under intense pressure. Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Rajya Sabha, Chadha said that delivery personnel are not robots, but individuals who are someone's father, husband, brother, or son. \"I want to tell you that these people are not robots. They are also someone's father, husband, brother, or son. The House should think about them. And the cruelty of this 10-minute delivery should end,\" he said. The AAP leader said while consumers hope their food reaches them in 10 minutes, the House should also think about the welfare of gig workers. Chadha described delivery personnel working for platforms like Zomato, Swiggy, Blinkit, Zepto, ride-hailing services such as Ola and Uber, and home service providers as the \"invisible wheels of the Indian economy\". \"Every day we press a button on our mobile phone app and get a notification that your order is on its way, order delivered, your ride has arrived. But behind this notification, there is often a person whom we do not acknowledge,\" he said. He noted that while quick commerce and instant delivery have helped companies achieve billion-dollar valuations and become unicorns, the condition of gig workers remains worse than that of daily wage labourers. Chadha highlighted three major challenges faced by gig workers: pressure of speed and delivery time, customer harassment, and hazardous working conditions. On the dangerous trend of 10-minute delivery, he said workers are forced to overspeed and jump red lights, fearing rating drops, incentive cuts, app logouts and ID blocks. \"A delivery boy standing on the red light keeps thinking that if he is late, the rating will fall, the incentive will be cut, the app will log out, and the ID", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/in-rajya-sabha-raghav-chadha-slams-10-minute-delivery-culture-calls-gig-workers-invisible-wheels-of-india-s-economy-11764925347034.html", "timestamp": 1764952839.6747599}

People had to cancel their plans or make alterations at the last moment. Such events are rare. However, in the past as well, there have been instances of air travel disruptions that have caused havoc with people’s plans. Here are five occasions in the past when air travel was left seriously paralyzed. Earlier in this year, a government shutdown in the US led to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) being short-staffed, forcing it to make heavy cuts to air traffic. As many as 40 airports were chosen for a reduction of air traffic, according to Travel Radar. The disruptions reached a crescendo when, on 8 November, the number of flights cancelled or delayed reached 5,000. Almost 13,000 air traffic controllers were working without pay, leading to issues for the authorities as many called in sick or looked for alternative employment. Once the shutdown was over, things went back to normalcy. On 12 June 2025, the Air India Flight 171 going from Ahmedabad to London crashed shortly after take-off, killing all but one person on board. After the tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171, which was en route to London from Ahmedabad, all flights from Delhi Airport Terminal 1 to Ahmedabad were cancelled as a precautionary measure, India Today reported. Services resumed later. In November 2025, aviation giant Airbus was forced to change its schedule due to problems with the A320 planes, the main model used by the company. The issues affected 6,000 flights, as per Politico. “Intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls,” a statement from the company said. On 28 April 2025, the entire Iberian Peninsula and parts of France experienced a power outage that caused massive disruption to public transport, as trains remained stranded for hours.

When she showed her boarding pass, they allegedly insisted that the flight would not operate. “They told me the flight was cancelled when actually it wasn't cancelled. I asked, ‘Are you sure?’ I showed my boarding pass, and they said ‘Yes. Very sure. Your flight is cancelled. Please go back home’,” she told ANI. “At around 7 o’clock, somebody calls me from the boarding gate, saying, ‘Ma’am, where are you? Your flight is about to leave.’ I said I'd been sent back home by the IndiGo staff. Now, tell me, if they are saying the flight is cancelled, obviously, I will believe, right?” the passenger added. The woman said she could not understand how such a mistake happened. She wondered if the airline wanted to adjust passengers from earlier disrupted flights or deal with overbooking. “I don't know whether they have a sinister plan to get, maybe, some people from yesterday who were stranded, or maybe it is overbooked. I don't know. But I've never heard such a situation ever in my life,” the passenger said. “Now, I have come back, and I'm standing in this long queue...\" she added.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

From ‘AI-generated’ becoming part of our modern lexicon to ChatGPT, Face ID and Turnitin being just some examples of AI-powered technologies used practically everyday, AI is well and truly here – but what exactly is AI and how can you use it to work smarter? Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

From the AI boom to the 2024 Budget, employees in 2025 will need to be more strategic than they’ve ever been to get, and stay ahead, in their respective industries. According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021. As the 2024 Budget means higher operating costs for businesses, more employers are cutting back on hiring, but where does this leave an employee in 2025? Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

An estimated 60% of employers expect that increasing digital access will transform their businesses by 2030.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture.

This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality.

This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace?
