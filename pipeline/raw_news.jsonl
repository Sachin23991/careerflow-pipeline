The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1763399918.8258305}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

This is not only about circuits and signals; this is where science, technology, and innovation propel advancement across all spectrums of life in a connected world. EE and EECE are based on an in-depth engineering core, and each offers an equally valuable, distinct range of options for students eager to pursue careers at the interface of energy, electronics, and communication. The diversity of each option is also essential for anyone wanting to reflect upon a well-considered and motivated direction for further study or career, and this includes a discussion of the subject matter in both options – not only do I want to characterize the topic matters, but there are distinctions concerning employment opportunities in each area of study. Electrical Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest areas of engineering. The general concept of electrical engineering captures the study, design, and invention of electricity.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues. Each student benefits from one-on-one interaction with tea", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/autistic-students-special-schools-autism-spectrum-disorder-campus-needs-children-day-2025-10349218/", "timestamp": 1763399927.4310694}

Participating in international moot courts and research projects exposed me to diverse legal systems, and I found myself increasingly drawn to understanding global frameworks of justice and governance. The idea of studying abroad became less about a dream and more about an academic necessity — a step towards widening my perspective and grounding my legal education in an international context. I come from Chandigarh , and completed both my Class 10 and Class 12 from Shivalik Public School. My school, and the city itself, gave me a strong sense of grounding. My academic interests started shaping there, especially as I took part in debates, science exhibitions, and extracurricular activities that built my interest in public affairs and law.  After schooling, I moved to Symbiosis Law School, Noida, under Symbiosis International (Deemed) University, to pursue my BA LLB. degree. Thanks to an academic collaboration between my college and the University of Birmingham, I was offered the chance to complete my LLM in International Law and Security in the UK while still being enrolled in my undergraduate law degree.

Studying law in the UK, especially international law, felt like being at the heart of the subject.

For the LLM, I did not apply to other universities. My path to the University of Birmingham was secured through the institutional agreement, and I viewed it as a rare opportunity.

In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision.

Officials attributed the spike to calm winds, a stable atmosphere, and weather conditions that trapped pollutants near the surface. With the implementation of GRAP Stage III, several restrictions have come into effect across the capital and adjoining regions. These include a ban on non-essential construction work, the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, and curbs on the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and neighbouring NCR districts. However, persons with disabilities are exempt from the vehicle restrictions.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES).

CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763399951.5249133}

The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends.

The minister made the announcement during an inspection of the Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences, a Delhi government senior secondary residential school located in Isapur village, Najafgarh. During the visit, he held detailed discussions with officials and local residents about various educational and residential welfare schemes for students. Singh said that several hostels for school and college students across Delhi were shut down in the past due to the negligence of the previous government. He also alleged that irregularities had been reported in coaching institutes meant to prepare students for competitive examinations. According to a statement, the Isapur residential school was established for SC, OBC, minority, and orphan students, offering free accommodation, meals, uniforms, stationery, and medical services. The school also provided vocational training and sports facilities for the holistic development of students, it stated. However, it was closed in September 2024 due to the dilapidated condition of the building and lack of financial support. At the time of closure, nearly 800 students were enrolled against its capacity of 1,200, it read. During the inspection, Singh said the government’s focus is on ensuring quality education and a safe residential environment for children from underprivileged sections of society. He added that the government is actively working to reopen closed hostels and build new ones to meet the needs of students.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic. They influenced a well-known mathematician named Al-Khwarizmi, who lived in present-day Iraq.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) Civil Services Examination , often seen as a ladder to power and influence, has recorded less than 40 per cent female participation in the 2010-2021 period, along with abysmally low participation of transgender candidates, as reflected in the Commission’s annual reports. Despite constitutional promises, global treaties, and initiatives like PM-DAKSH and the National Portal for Transgender Persons, gender equality remains elusive. UPSC reports from 2010 to 2021 show consistently low participation of women and transgender individuals in the Civil Services Examination, with 2021 being the most recent data available. According to the 2021 UPSC annual report, only 32.98 per cent of candidates appearing for the CSE Prelims examination were women. Of these, just 14.75 per cent qualified in the preliminary round.  In the second and final stages of the CSE, the mains and interview, only 26.87 per cent (408) of the candidates were women. In the final list for 2021, only 15.66 per cent, or 201 women, cleared the exam.

The AI-powered device autonomously monitors water quality in real time, replacing the traditional, labour-intensive manual sampling process. By detecting pollutants early, it aims to prevent environmental damage and improve access to clean water — a major step forward as over 40% of the world’s rivers and lakes remain severely polluted. OnCue, created by Italian product designer Alessandra Galli, an alumna of Delft University of Technology, was named the Medical winner. The innovation is a smart keyboard designed for people living with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike conventional assistive devices, OnCue integrates therapeutic visual and haptic cues that help manage tremors, freezing, and other motor symptoms, making typing smoother and more accessible.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

Seven IITs, which feature in the top 10 among Indian institutions in the QS Asia Rankings 2026, have seen a significant fall in their ranks this year compared to last year.

READ MORE| India’s top IITs rank slip as universities from China, Singapore surge ahead in QS Asia Rankings 2026 The ranking of Asian universities, released on Tuesday, reflects an eastward concentration of top performance, QS said. Indian institutions retain strong reputations but face stiff competition from those in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Malaysia, which are outperforming them on metrics like ‘citations per paper’, which is a measure of the impact of research, faculty-student ratio, and international student ratio. Reacting to the rankings, Prof Chakraborty said: “The QS rankings are one of several reference points in a very broad and complex global higher education ecosystem. A movement in ranking, up or down, should ideally be read in context rather than in isolation. IIT Kharagpur has always believed in driving its own metrics of global relevance, those rooted in national priorities and social impact, rather than being limited by conventional yardsticks alone.” IIT Kharagpur, sixth among Indian institutions, saw its rank drop from 60 in 2025 to 77 in 2026. This year’s rank is also a steep fall from the institute’s rank of 58 recorded in 2021. “We do recognise that some parameters like faculty-student ratio, international faculty and student diversity, and citation counts per faculty are areas where all IITs, including IIT Kharagpur, can certainly", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/qs-world-rankings-asia-universities-2026-ranks-indian-institutes-drop-rank-iit-kharagpur-director-reacts-suman-chakraborty-10347239/", "timestamp": 1763399967.7827177}

Among the three pillars of NEET, namely Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, Physics often becomes the subject that students fear the most. I have seen that anxiety many times in my classroom: the sighs when numerical problems appear, the hesitation before attempting a new concept, and the sense of defeat before even beginning. But let me tell you something from years of teaching and mentoring students for NEET, Physics isn’t the monster it’s made out to be. In fact, once you understand its logic, it can become your strongest scoring subject. The secret lies in three things: conceptual clarity, consistent practice, and a calm mind. In NEET (UG), Physics carries 45 questions with a total of 180 marks. While Biology has a greater share with 360 marks, Physics often decides whether a student will be among the top rankers. Biology largely depends on memorisation, while Physics tests understanding and application. It demands reasoning, connection between ideas, and a clear thought process. These qualities form the foundation of a doctor. Physics teaches discipline, sharpens analytical ability, and prepares students to handle uncertainty. In many ways, the challenges of Physics resemble those faced in medical practice. Over the years, I have observed that top-performing students in NEET do not necessarily study for long hours. Instead, they study in a structured and efficient way. The following approach can help any student achieve similar results. Build Conceptual Depth — Not Surface Understanding Begin each topic with your NCERT textbook. Read the definitions, formulas, and derivations carefully. Don’t rush. If a concept feels unclear, seek clarification immediately from your teacher, a friend, or even a trusted online source. Most NEET Physics questions are rooted in these basic principles, not in obscure trick questions.

Developed in collaboration with YNOS, an IIT Madras-incubated startup, the project aims to bridge the information gap that has long hindered founders, investors, and other ecosystem players. The initiative was launched by Dr Palanivel Thiagarajan, Minister for Information Technology and Digital Services, Government of Tamil Nadu , during the ‘TN Global Startup Summit’ held recently in Chennai . India’s startup ecosystem — the world’s third-largest — is expected to play a pivotal role in achieving the nation’s Viksit Bharat 2047 vision and $5 trillion economy target, a statement released by IIT Madras noted, adding that yet, a major challenge remains the “information conundrum,” where data appears abundant but is fragmented and scattered, making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions. Addressing this issue, IIT Madras CREST and YNOS have developed India’s only independent digital platform dedicated to startups. The platform already hosts over 2.75 lakh startups, 15,000 angel investors, 5,500 venture capital firms, 1,400 incubators, 800 banks, and 110 government support schemes, making it the country’s largest and most comprehensive startup database. Explaining the objective, Prof Thillai Rajan A, head of CREST and faculty member at the Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras, said: “Information asymmetry has long been one of the biggest barriers for founders. Through the ‘Startups for All’ initiative, we aim to level the playing field by giving every entrepreneur and citizen — irrespective of location or background — equal access to credible information that supports smarter decisions and faster growth.

Speaking to indianexpress.com , he shared that although AIR 2 is a great achievement, it felt unreal. “I did not expect to secure AIR 2… It is a great feeling,” he said.

He appeared for the CA Foundation in 2021 and has been clearing all levels in his first attempt since then, including the Intermediate-level exams this year. His typical routine during the CA Final group exams was intense and disciplined. “I studied for about 12 hours during the final group preparation, along with regular workout sessions,” Tejas shared. But it was hardly all work and no play. Beyond the monotonous study sessions, Tejas looked forward to his weekend ritual with great anticipation. “Six days I study, and on Sundays I look forward to going out with friends for a 5-km run. It is something I really enjoy and helps me maintain balance,” he said. Tejas was also clear about the need to get coaching. “It helps you understand what to learn, what all to understand, and how to cover the syllabus. This is only possible with a professor or teacher’s help. Coaching is essential,” he said, adding that he left coaching after the Intermediate exams round and continued his pre", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/icai-ca-final-september-2025-result-hyderabad-tejas-mundada-air-2-first-attempt-social-media-marks-score-strategy-10343405/", "timestamp": 1763399985.7911954}

Nearly half of them believe their roles AI can make a switch in their jobs within the next three to five years. According to the ‘Voice of India on Artificial Intelligence’ report released by Great Place to Work, a global workplace culture research and consulting organisation, 49% of millennial employees express concern about AI-driven job displacement. The report, based on responses from professionals across industries and experience levels, maps how employees perceive AI’s rise, its workplace impact, and the cultural shifts that accompany its adoption. While millennials emerge as the most anxious generation in the workforce, they are not alone in their apprehension. The report shows that 49% of millennials fear AI could replace their jobs in the coming years, with 23% agreeing to a large extent and 26% to a moderate extent. Gen Z follows closely at 45%, suggesting that younger professionals entering the workforce are equally uneasy about automation. Among Gen X and older employees, the concern drops to 35%, indicating that the sense of vulnerability is sharper among younger, tech-facing cohorts. Interestingly, this concern cuts across experience levels: the report notes that between 42% and 58% of employees across different career stages share similar worries. This suggests that AI-related job insecurity has become a common undercurrent across India’s workplaces, regardless of seniority or tenure. The report finds a clear link between fear of AI and employees’ intent to leave their organisations. Among those worried that artificial intelligence could replace their roles, at least 40% are actively considering an exit.

The two coaching institutes are: Dikshant IAS and Abhimanu IAS. In the preceding month, the Authority fined Rs 5 lakh to the Delhi-based coaching institute Drishti IAS . Back in January, Vision IAS was also under scrutiny by the CCPA , which imposed a penalty of Rs 3 lakh for deceptive advertising about its students’ success in the civil services examination. CCPA has taken action against Dikshant IAS and Abhimanu IAS following complaints from successful UPSC candidates regarding unauthorised use of their names and photographs in promotional materials. Mini Shukla (AIR 96, UPSC CSE 2021) submitted a representation stating that her image and name were used by Dikshant IAS without her consent.

Watching SpaceX build reusable rockets and develop space robotics sparked in me a dream to be part of such innovation. I wanted to be in a place where I could explore similar ideas and be surrounded by people who shared the same curiosity and drive. I first appeared for JEE Advanced right after Class 12 and managed a decent rank, but I wanted to improve. I decided to take a drop year and give it one more serious attempt. That decision changed my life — the following year, I secured admission into IIT Mandi. Preparing for JEE Main and JEE Advanced was not easy. During my drop year, I joined a coaching in Kota and studied nearly six to eight hours a day. I never enjoyed inorganic chemistry, but my biggest challenge wasn’t the syllabus – it was maintaining consistency under pressure. There were moments of burnout and self-doubt, but my parents and teachers encouraged me to push through. But now, when I look back, I feel it was all worth it. I am doing Bioengineering with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Mandi . My hometown is Bhind, Madhya Pradesh. I completed my schooling at a CBSE school. My father is a businessman, and my mother a homemaker — both have been my strongest support system. What I miss most about Bhind is the sense of belonging that only home can bring. When choosing a branch, I initially leaned toward Aerospace Engineering and Robotics. However, with my background in biology, I found Bioengineering fascinating because it connects biology, computation, and robotics – fields that can truly impact society.

Small mistakes in these final days can undo months of efforts – countless practice, revision on the loop, repeated mock attempts and performance analysis – all can go into vain. It happens with the best of the best. The following is the list of the most common mistakes aspirants make close to the CAT and how you can avoid them – walking into the exam with focus and confidence. In the final stretch, many aspirants fall into the “more mocks = more improvement” trap. This happens especially with the ones who start their preparation late. Many of the aspirants start writing a full-length mock every day or worse, trying to attempt two mocks a day. This process does more harm than good. This leads to a drop in accuracy (result of inadequate post mock analysis), fatigue build up and drop in confidence. Reduce mock frequency to 2-3 per week and focus on deep analysis. Ask yourself questions like: Which questions did I choose wrongly? Did I waste time on a trap set? Did I panic midway? You need to chase understanding rather than scores and focus on exam attempt strategy. In the process of trying to cover left over topics, strengthening certain topics, attempting more than required mocks – candidates often miss adequate revision. They keep taking tests without revising their basics – forgetting one small formula or concept mid-exam can cost valuable marks. Well, the right course is to create a formula/trick/revision book while you are covering the concepts. If that is not done, create one quickly. Spend 20-30 minutes, 3-4 days a week revisiting these notes and updating them. The goal isn’t to learn new things – it’s to make your brain recall old things (Formulas, patterns, logics) instantly. Aspirants need to understand that it is normal for mock scores to fluctuate. In the last 3-4 weeks, many students lose confidence because of this.

Each year, the Directorate receives around 2 lakh applications under the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Disadvantaged Groups (DG), and Children With Special Needs (CWSN) categories for approximately 40,000 seats, many of which remain vacant due to the shortage of recognised schools.

Indians spent $50.25 million on education in Georgia in 2024-25, a nearly five-fold surge from $10.33 million in 2018-19, according to data on Reserve Bank of India’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), obtained under the RTI Act. This rise, the LRS data shows, has come largely at Ukraine’s expense, with Indian remittances for education there dropping from $14.80 million in 2018-19 to just $2.40 million in 2024-25. In the years before the war, Indian remittances for education in Ukraine were rising. In fact, Ukraine was among the top 10 destinations for Indian students in 2020-21 and 2021-22, when remittances touched $39.12 million. This fell sharply to about $10.6 million in 2022-23, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The same year, 2022-23, Georgia entered the list of top 15 countries to which Indians sent money for education abroad — ranking 14th, a significant jump from its 21st position in 2018-19. The country has since moved up to the 12th place. According to data submitted in Parliament in December last year on the number of Indians who disclosed their purpose as ‘study/education’ while going abroad, there were 4,148 such Indians who went to Georgia in 2019. This number rose to 10,470 in 2023.

It also stated that over 22 per cent students are concerned about funding constraints and lack of guidance on legal matters. The report titled, “Youth entrepreneurship and start-up governance-guiding the next generation of leaders towards stability and success”, draws from a dual-cohort study involving 1,000 students across Indian universities and 200 industry professionals, including founders, CXOs, investors, and ecosystem experts. The findings of the report launched at Leadership Summit by BML Munjal University, reveal a generation that is not only ambitious but also eager to build responsible ventures anchored in transparency and trust. Nearly three-fourths of the students surveyed expressed a clear intention to start their own ventures, reflecting the growing mainstream appeal of entrepreneurship as a preferred career path. “A lack of mentorship is the most significant challenge, cited by 35 per cent of student respondents. Guidance on legal and financial matters (24 per cent) and funding constraints (22 per cent) also represent substantial concerns. Fear of failure (13 per cent) and difficulty balancing studies with entrepreneurial efforts (7 per cent) are less prevalent but still notable,” the report noted. Governance, often perceived as a compliance burden, is instead emerging as a catalyst for stability and scale. More than half of the industry respondents viewed governance as an enabler of growth, while 33 pc identified it as the most deficient capability among youth-led start-ups. The study found that ventures with structured board reviews, transparent reporting systems, and ethical frameworks earned significantly higher investor trust.

This means Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) can pay utility bills or recharge their mobile prepaid plans for their family. The startup said that until now, users had to either transfer the money to their Indian accounts or ask someone to handle the bills for them. The other option for them was to use their foreign cards and try and pay bills while facing high charges and payment failures. Aspora has hooked up to the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS), which handles bill payments in India, using Yes Bank’s domestic pipeline. Through this system, it has enabled payment for more than 22,000 billers in India, ranging from electricity providers such as BSES and BESCOM, broadband providers like Jio and Airtel, and loan payments for major banks. The startup said it’s not charging any fees for these payments, and the users get the best exchange rates to pay the bill directly in foreign currency. “For millions of Indians living overseas, paying bills in India has always been unnecessarily complex – involving transfers, delays, and double fees. Aspora has now solved this large-scale problem at the tap of a button”,  Aspora founder and CEO Parth Garg told TechCrunch in a recent phone interview.

That means the large language models underpinning AI products today need even more data centers to be trained and for inferencing, and therefore, they need more power. Against that backdrop, energy efficiency has suddenly become a critical priority for semiconductor manufacturers. PowerLattice , a startup founded by veteran electrical engineers from Qualcomm, NUVIA, and Intel in 2023, claims to have developed a groundbreaking approach that reduces the power needs of computer chips by more than 50%. On Monday, the startup emerged from stealth with a $25 million Series A funding round led by Playground Global and Celesta Capital, bringing its total funding to $31 million. “This is the hard stuff: How do you get power into the device? There are very few teams and people that can do it,” said Pat Gelsinger, general partner at Playground Global. “We have assembled what I’d argue is the dream team of power delivery.” As the former CEO of Intel, Gelsinger carries significant authority in the semiconductor world, which makes his participation a powerful stamp of approval for PowerLattice. In fact, when the startup’s CEO Dr. Peng Zou and its founding team pitched their idea at Playground’s offices in March, they were so star-struck by Gelsinger’s fame that they asked him for a selfie, Gelsinger told TechCrunch. The admiration proved mutual, as Gelsinger came away genuinely impressed with PowerLattice’s technology.

Bezos would be returning to operations for the first time since he stepped away from Amazon in 2021. According to the NYT, the startup is going to build AI products for engineering and manufacturing in various fields like computers, aerospace, and automobiles. Project Prometheus is focused on “AI for the physical economy,” per its LinkedIn page , and the report noted that its work will resemble that of Periodic Labs , which is building technology to speed up scientific research by simulating the physical world to train AI models. The company already has almost 100 staff, including researchers from AI firms like Meta, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, the report said. Amazon and Bajaj did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While he was working on making the best chips he could, the more important bottleneck was in software. “You can make the best hardware on earth, but if it’s hard for developers to use, they’re just not going to use it,” he told me. Now, he’s started a company that focuses entirely on that problem. On Monday, Luminal announced $5.3 million in seed funding , in a round led by Felicis Ventures with angel investment from Paul Graham, Guillermo Rauch, and Ben Porterfield. Fioti’s co-founders, Jake Stevens and Matthew Gunton, come from Apple and Amazon, respectively, and the company was part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch . Luminal’s core business is simple: the company sells compute, just like neo-cloud companies like Coreweave or Lambda Labs. But where those companies focus on GPUs, Luminal has focused on optimization techniques that let the company squeeze more compute out of the infrastructure it has. In particular, the company focuses on optimizing the compiler that sits between written code and the GPU hardware — the same developer systems that caused Fioti so many headaches in his previous job. At the moment, the industry’s leading compiler is Nvidia’s CUDA system — an underrated element in the company’s runaway success. But many elements of CUDA are open-source, and Luminal is betting that, with many in the industry still scrambling for GPUs, there will be a lot of value to be gained in building out the rest of the stack. It’s part of a growing cohort of inference-optimization startups, which have grown more valuable as companies look for faster and cheaper ways to run their models. Inference providers like Baseten and Together AI have long specialized in optimization, and smaller companies like Tensormesh and Clarifai are now popping up to focus on more specific technical tricks.

It was created by third-time founder Andrew Berman (previous companies: baby-monitor maker Nanit and an AI video conferencing tool, Vowel, that sold to Zapier in 2024 ). In the four months since Runlayer launched its product in stealth, it has signed dozens of customers, including eight unicorns or public companies like Gusto, dbt Labs, Instacart, and Opendoor, it says. It also nabbed David Soria Parra, the lead creator of MCP, as an angel and advisor, Berman tells TechCrunch. (Parra did not respond to our request for comment.) Parra’s team at Anthropic launched the protocol in November 2024 as an open source project. MCP has since become the de facto standard for allowing AI agents to connect with the data and systems they need to work independently. It allows agents to access data, move it, alter it, and execute business processes without human oversight. The protocol is now supported by every major model maker including OpenAI , Microsoft, AWS, Google as well as thousands of tech and enterprise companies ; just to name a few: Atlassian, Asana, Stripe, Block, others ranging from banks to consumer goods manufacturers. “Everyone talks about AI,” Berman, Runlayer’s CEO, told TechCrunch. “but AI is really only as useful as the tools and the resources it has access to.” The problem is, the MCP protocol itself doesn’t include much security out of the box , so many MCP implementations have already been found to be vulnerable in a variety of ways. The poster children are probably GitHub and Asana. In May, researchers at Invariant Labs discovered a prompt injection vulnerability in MCP servers that allowed them to grab data from private GitHub repositories (ones that shouldn’t have been accessible to the public). Asana discovered and fixed a vulnerability in its MCP server in June that could have e", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/17/mcp-ai-agent-security-startup-runlayer-launches-with-8-unicorns-11m-from-khoslas-keith-rabois-and-felicis/", "timestamp": 1763400299.3985755}

Founded in Russia, Protei makes telecommunications systems for phone and internet providers across dozens of countries, including Bahrain, Italy, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Pakistan and much of central Africa. The company, now headquartered in Jordan, sells video conferencing technology and internet connectivity solutions, as well as surveillance equipment and web-filtering products, such as deep packet inspection systems. It’s not clear exactly when or how Protei was hacked, but a copy of the company’s website saved on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine shows it was defaced on November 8. The website was restored soon after. During the breach, the hacker obtained the contents of Protei’s web server — around 182 gigabytes of files — including emails dating back years. A copy of Protei’s data was provided to DDoSecrets , a non-profit transparency collective that indexes leaked datasets in the public interest, including data from law enforcement, government agencies, and companies involved in the surveillance industry. Mohammad Jalal, the managing director of Protei’s branch in Jordan, did not respond to a request for comment about the breach. The identity of the hacker is not known, nor their motivations, but the defaced website read: “another DPI/SORM provider bites the dust.” The message likely references the company’s sales of deep packet inspection systems and other internet filtering technology for the Russian-developed lawful intercept system known as SORM .

Seoul is also accelerating investment in advanced weapons systems and expanding its defense ties, particularly with Europe. With the new EU–South Korea Security and Defence Partnership in 2024 and growing exports of vehicles and artillery, the country has become the second-largest arms supplier to European NATO members. Yet despite that enormous industrial footprint, remarkably few startups have emerged to match or challenge the incumbents. The country’s defense-tech startup scene is still nascent, exposing a wide gap between Korea’s manufacturing strength and its early-stage innovation. Bone AI , a new startup based in Seoul and Palo Alto, California, launched earlier this year with an ambitious plan to build a fully unified AI platform that ties together software, hardware, and manufacturing. The company develops next-generation autonomous air (UAVs), ground (UGVs) and marine (USVs) vehicles for defense and government clients, focusing largely on B2G contracts. While it ultimately aims to operate all three types of systems, Bone is starting with its defense-focused aerial drones, which are designed to streamline missions such as logistics support, wildfire detection and anti-drone defense. The company, founded by DK Lee (who also co-founded MarqVision ), has raised a $12 seed round led by Third Prime with participation from Kolon Group, a South Korean strategic investor that has expertise in developing advanced materials and manufacturing. Kolon is an ideal strategic partner for Bone, which operates across AI, robotics and next-generation manufacturing, Lee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.

Founded in 2023 by former Google researchers Llion Jones, Ren Ito and Ha, Sakana AI makes affordable generative AI models that work well with small datasets and are optimized for the Japanese language and culture. The Series B round drew a mix of new and returning investors, combining Japan’s financial heavyweights like Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) with global venture players such as Khosla Ventures, Macquarie Capital, NEA, Lux Capital and In-Q-Tel (IQT). “We plan to deploy the new capital for not only R&D, including [AI] model development, but also to expand our workforce for engineering, sales, and distribution teams in Japan,” Ha said. This year, Sakana has expanded its presence in Japan, teaming up with leading local enterprises, including Daiwa and MUFG , and developing AI solutions . Ha, who previously led research at Stability AI and worked at Google and Goldman Sachs, also said Sakana plans to expand its enterprise business beyond finance into the industrial, manufacturing, and government sectors in 2026.

These include competitors like Adyen, a Dutch payment processing giant that remains far ahead in scale. However, Flatpay’s fresh funding could help it narrow the gap. Flatpay’s bet is that it can challenge larger players by charging small merchants a flat transaction rate to use its card terminals and point-of-sales systems. This focus on a segment that accounts for 99% of European businesses has driven rapid traction: the startup now claims around 60,000 customers, up from 7,000 in April 2024 . Flatpay’s own valuation has grown at a similarly fast pace. Now valued at €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion), the Danish startup reached unicorn status in only three years. But while CEO and co-founder Sander Janca-Jensen is proud of this accomplishment, he has his eyes on another metric: annual recurring revenue (ARR). “We crossed €100 million of ARR in October,” Janca-Jensen told TechCrunch. He added that this amount (approximately $116 million) is increasing by nearly €1 million a day ($1.16 million). “The plan for 2026 is to grow another 300%, so hopefully leave the year with between €400 and €500 million of ARR.” To fund this ambitious growth — since the startup is still unprofitable — Flatpay raised €145 million in its latest round (approximately $169 million). The round was backed by AVP and Smash Capital, as well as Dawn Capital, which had led the startup’s €$47 million Series B . German soccer player Mario Götze also participated in that previous round. The newly raised capital will support continued growth in Flatpay’s current markets — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and the U.K. — as well as further expansion into one or two new markets next year.

Jackie Fielder, who represents the Mission District on SF’s Board of Supervisors, brought up Kit Kat while making the case for a proposed city resolution that calls on the state to allow local voters to decide whether driverless cars can operate in their neighborhoods. “A human driver can be held accountable, can hop out, say sorry, can be tracked down by police if it’s a hit-and-run,” Fielder told the Times. “Here, there is no one to hold accountable.” Waymo, whose co-CEO recently spoke at Disrupt about the importance of safety , described the incident as one where a cat “darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away.” The company said it sends “our deepest sympathies to the cat’s owner and the community who knew and loved him.” Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

As industry observers know, Morris co-founded Capital One and pioneered lending to subprime borrowers, building an empire on understanding exactly how much financial stress the average American can handle. Now, as an early investor in Klarna and other buy-now-pay-later companies like Aplazo in Mexico, he’s watching something that makes him deeply uncomfortable. “To see that people are using [BNPL services] to buy something as basic and fundamental as groceries,” Morris told me on stage at Web Summit in Lisbon this week, “I think is a pretty clear indication that a lot of people are struggling.” The statistics back up his unease. Buy-now-pay-later services have exploded to 91.5 million users in the United States, according to the financial services firm Empower , with 25% using the services to finance their groceries as of earlier this year, according to survey data released in late October by lending marketplace Lending Tree. These aren’t discretionary purchases — the designer bags and latest Apple headphones that BNPL was marketed for originally. Borrowers aren’t paying it all back, either. According to Lending Tree, default rates are accelerating: 42% of BNPL users made at least one late payment in 2025, up from 39% in 2024 and 34% in 2023. This isn’t just a consumer finance story; it’s a canary in the coal mine for the entire venture-backed fintech ecosystem and beyond, echoing what preceded the 2008 mortgage crisis except for one thing: it’s largely invisible. Because most BNPL loans aren’t reported to credit bureaus, they create what regulators call “phantom debt.” That means other lenders can’t see when someone has taken out five different BNPL loans across multiple platforms.

It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts. The satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network’s location in what’s known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.” As Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren’t well-served by traditional internet providers. But, as TechCrunch previously noted , the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX’s Starlink service. Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment. An archived version of the main FAQ page for Kuiper — published in late 2024 — puts the aforementioned “mission” to serve those communities right at the top of the post. Affordability is mentioned three times throughout, with Amazon calling it a “key principle of Project Kuiper.” “Amazon has a longstanding commitment to low prices, and lots of experience building popular, low-cost devices like Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick,” reads the answer to a question on the archived post about how much Kuiper service will cost. “We’re applying a similar approach with Project Kuiper.” That question-and-answer about cost is now gone from the Leo FAQ , and there is no mention of “affordability” anywhere on the page.

Detroit, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the cities the company plans to bring its robotaxi to in the coming months. But as I have argued in this newsletter before, there is another “expansion” I think is more important. Freeways. And now after years of testing and development, the company’s commercial robotaxi service is using freeways around the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. This is a critical expansion for the company. It’s the concrete and asphalt connective tissue in sprawling metro areas like the Bay Area. This new freeway access is fueling Waymo’s expansion in that region, which is now 260 square miles and encompasses Silicon Valley and San Francisco. Robotaxi rides can have more efficient routes too. Waymo told me it will reduce ride times by up to 50%. And using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. That freeway-to-airport moment will be the big unlock for Waymo. But will it be enough to help push it in the black? Until someone over there slides me their balance sheet, I can’t say. It will certainly be a popular option for travelers. That doesn’t mean the economics will pencil out.

Those numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change . Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report’s findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch’s Equity podcast . There’s no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects , which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy. We also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed  $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion , and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan . You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below. Kirsten: Here’s what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who’s our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It’s a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center. So to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it. But of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.

In addition to bringing Disney networks like ABC, ESPN, and FX back to YouTube’s streaming TV service, the deal will also see ESPN make its new direct-to-consumer service available on YouTube TV at no additional cost. YouTube will also be able to sell select Disney networks and the Disney+/Hulu bundle as part of different packages. In a statement, Disney Entertainment co-chairmen Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro, described the deal as one that “recognizes the tremendous value of Disney’s programming and provides YouTube TV subscribers with more flexibility and choice.” “We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,” the Disney executives added. YouTube also released a statement Friday saying that subscribers would see the affected channels restored “throughout the course of the day.” The company said, “We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers’ patience as we negotiated on their behalf.” YouTube TV is meant to be a cable TV alternative for cord cutters, but like most cable TV providers, the service has had its share of disputes with major content providers — usually over how much money to pay them and how much flexibility it has to offer their content in different bundles. The last time YouTube and Disney renegotiated in 2022, there was a similar ( if significantly briefer ) blackout. This time around, YouTube offered customers a $20 credit that they can apply to their next bill. One survey even suggested that due to the Disney blackout, 24% of the service’s more than 10 million subscribers said they had already canceled their subscription or planned to do so soon.

Commander Chen Dong, concluding his third trip to space, and rookie crewmates Chen Zhongrui and Wang Jie touched down inside their spacecraft at the Dongfeng landing zone at 1:29 am EST (06:29 UTC) Friday. The parachute-assisted landing occurred in the mid-afternoon at the return zone, located in the remote Gobi Desert of northwestern China. Chinese space officials upended operations on the country’s Tiangong space lab last week after astronauts found damage to one of two Shenzhou return capsules docked at the station. The China Manned Space Agency, run by the country’s military, announced changes to the space station’s flight plan November 4, the day before three crew members were supposed to depart and fly home. Chen and his crewmates were preparing to board the Shenzhou 20 spacecraft for the ride back to Earth a few days after the arrival of three replacement crew members on the newly launched Shenzhou 21 capsule. Shenzhou 20 is the same spacecraft that launched Chen’s crew in April. But a little more than a week ago, Chinese officials said the Shenzhou 20 spacecraft was “suspected of being impacted by small space debris” and confirmed the return trip would be postponed. Officials provided no additional details. China’s human spaceflight agency released a cryptic statement earlier this week saying preparations were underway for the crew’s undocking and landing, but the circumstances of the return remained opaque until hours before the astronauts’ homecoming. Finally, officials confirmed the details of the return to Earth late Thursday. “Based on preliminary analysis of photographs, design review, simulation analysis, and wind tunnel tests, a comprehensive assessment determined that the Shenzhou 20 manned spacecraft’s return capsule window glass had developed a minor cra", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/three-astronauts-are-stuck-on-chinas-space-station-without-a-safe-ride-home/", "timestamp": 1763400320.8048747}

You’ve got about two to three years, give or take, before your beloved bed sheets and feather pillows are going to give up the ghost and need replacing .

When their time is up, you must—in the most literal sense—lay them to rest. I take the mantra of “reuse, reduce, and recycle” very seriously, and will eke out as much extra mileage as I can by cutting up old sheets and towels to use as cleaning rags, or making a ratty old pillow into a makeshift dog bed. Recycling programs near me don’t accept textiles, so eventually I have to toss them into the trash, knowing they're headed to a landfill. The numbers on textile waste are astounding.

Faceless, shrouded in black with red eyes and a top hat, it ominously lurks in the corner. The Benadryl Hat Man is a shared and recurring hallucination that people report witnessing when taking dozens of the antihistamine at a time. The figure, depicted in Halloween costumes , POV-Benadryl trip memes , and Walmart graphic tees , has become the symbol for a new drug trend that sees young people deliberately taking large doses of the drug, not to ward off allergies, but to get high. John, a 21-year-old college student who used to trip on Benadryl, never saw the Hat Man. Yet, he says, “I could see how that could happen. It's [Benadryl] digging in the depths of your brain to find whatever's making you scared. So, if you're scared of the Hat Man, I'm sure you're going to see the Hat Man.” This searching for the unpleasant to reveal itself, while sounding horrible, is, in fact, the purpose of recreational Benadryl use. (John does not want his real name used due to fear of friends finding out.) When used in high doses, diphenhydramine, an ingredient in Benadryl, functions as a deliriant, a hallucinogenic class of drugs, which appear to be becoming increasingly popular among young people for nonmedical purposes. Unlike psychedelics or other hallucinogens, there’s no real potential for a good trip on a deliriant. According to the people I spoke to, every trip is bad, every trip is brutal, and that’s the point. In 2020, the “Benadryl challenge ” gained traction on TikTok, daring participants to take doses of at least 12 Benadryl pills for an intense trip. The trend, which resurfaces every few years, drew attention to the psychoactive effects of deliriants. “I saw a video about it on TikTok once, so I knew it could be used recreationally,” one user tells me.

I remember vividly my mom using baby powder in the 1980s, as well as my first purchase of drugstore dry shampoo in the early 2000s. It went on like spray paint and probably contained enough chemicals to poison a small animal, but it did the job of letting me skip a couple days of my arduous wash, dry, and straighten routine . This break was good for my sanity as well as my hair. Come 2022, commercially produced dry shampoo received its first major black eye when companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever conducted a voluntary recall of their dry shampoos for potentially elevated levels of benzene . Familiar drugstore brands like Dove, Nexxus, and Suave were suddenly seen as being a cancer risk, which raised the question with dry shampoos in general: What is actually in this stuff? Thankfully, since the recall most companies have taken to testing their products for benzene and other harmful chemicals. Third-party testing is hard to come by, but the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG) is independently funded and has a Skin Deep database tool for consumers to parse what harmful ingredients might be lurking in their cosmetics and personal care products.

There’s Sam Altman, chief executive of the whole company, who manages research and compute. And as of this summer, there’s Fidji Simo, the former CEO of Instacart, who manages everything else. Simo hasn’t been seen much at OpenAI’s San Francisco office since she began as CEO of Applications in August. But her presence is felt at every level of the company—not least because she’s heading up ChatGPT and basically every function that might make OpenAI money. Simo is dealing with a relapse of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) that makes her prone to fainting if she stands for long periods of time. So for now, she’s working from home in Los Angeles, and she’s on Slack. A lot. “Being present from 8 am to midnight every day, responding within five minutes, people feel like I’m there and that they can reach me immediately, that I jump on the phone within five minutes,” she tells me. Employees confirm that this is true. OpenAI’s famously Slack-driven culture can be overwhelming for new hires. But not, apparently, for Simo. Employees say she is often seen popping into channels and threads, sharing thoughts and asking questions. Simo joined during a chaotic period for OpenAI, which is expanding in nearly every direction. There are sovereign AI partnerships, new model releases, retail partnerships, multibillion-dollar compute deals , a proprietary chip, a mysterious hardware product—and of course, ChatGPT. “We do not battle for scope,” Simo says. “We battle for less scope.” Outside Silicon Valley, Simo’s hiring came as a surprise. For those in the know, it was less of a shock. A native of Sète, a small fishing town in the south of France, Simo made a name for herself running the Facebook app at Meta before taking the top job at Instacart in 2021.

They're more expensive than what you'd buy for an acquaintance, but if you're looking for a big reaction on Christmas morning from your kids, spouse, or significant other, one of these should do the trick. Nintendo Amazon Walmart (Bundle) Best Buy GameStop Easy prediction: The Switch 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is going to be the best-selling piece of tech this holiday season. The system only came out in June, and plenty of people have likely been saving up for a holiday purchase. It's a no-brainer for families, especially if they didn't already own an original Switch. You likely already know what makes the Switch 2 so special, with its highly improved (and larger) screen over the original. We aren't anticipating any major price cuts, but several bundles help save some cash, especially if you are already planning on purchasing a particular game. For example, the bundle with Super Mario Kart World saves you $30, which helps get around the expensive prices of the games. If your giftee already has a Switch 2, I recommend checking out our Nintendo Switch 2 accessories , all of which have been tested by us, which could also make for a great gift for Nintendo fans. Xbloom Amazon xBloom Perhaps more than any other coffee machine, the xBloom Studio Coffee Machine (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is made for tinkerers. It's an ambitious piece of tech that aims to recreate the perfect cup of pour-over coffee right in your home, all in one device.

Halliburton is the cofounder and CEO of Sazmining, a company that operates bitcoin mining hardware on behalf of clients—a model known as “mining-as-a-service.” Halliburton is based in Peru, but Sazmining runs mining hardware out of third-party data centers across Norway, Paraguay, Ethiopia, and the United States. As Halliburton tells it, he had flown to Amsterdam the previous day, August 5, to meet Even and Maxim, two representatives of a wealthy Monaco-based family. The family office had offered to purchase hundreds of bitcoin mining rigs from Sazmining—around $4 million worth—which the company would install at a facility currently under construction in Ethiopia. Before finalizing the deal, the family office had asked to meet Halliburton in person. When Halliburton arrived at the Rosewood Hotel, he found Even and Maxim perched in a booth. They struck him as playboy, high-roller types—particularly Maxim, who wore a tan three-piece suit and had a highly manicured look, his long dark hair parted down the middle. A Rolex protruded from the cuff of his sleeve. Over a three-course lunch—ceviche with a roe garnish, Chilean sea bass, and cherry cake—they discussed the contours of the deal and traded details about their respective backgrounds. Even was talkative and jocular, telling stories about blowout parties in Marrakech. Maxim was aloof; he mostly stared at Halliburton, holding his gaze for long periods at a time as though sizing him up. As a relationship-building exercise, Even proposed that Halliburton sell the family office around $3,000 in bitcoin. Halliburton was initially hesitant, but chalked it up as a peculiar dating ritual.

Marshall’s consumer arm (once a separate entity) became a success by leveraging the amplifier brand’s musical legacy for an expansive line of headphones and Bluetooth speakers that sound nearly as powerful, raucous, and downright fun as they look. Moving into soundbars might seem like a natural succession, but creating an all-in-one distributor of surround sound and spatial audio formats that sits neatly beneath your TV is not without its challenges. The Heston 120 is a beautiful reflection of Marshall’s design heritage, and there’s a lot this 5.1.2-channel system gets right, but it’s a surprisingly mercurial performer. It's capable of a premium touch and immersive overhead and side-firing effects. But when it comes to cinematic punch in action scenes and impactful moments, something is holding it back. In other words, this soundbar just doesn’t rock. It’s nearly impossible not to admire the Heston 120’s style. My wife—who has endured more soundbar unboxings than any audio civilian should have to—was immediately impressed by its striking design.

It’s another example of how genes exploit mechanical forces for growth and development.", "content": "The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine . Sip a glass of wine, and you will notice liquid continuously weeping down the wetted side of the glass. In 1855, James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin, explained in the Philosophical Magazine that these wine “tears” or “legs” result from the difference in surface tension between alcohol and water. “This fact affords an explanation of several very curious motions,” Thomson wrote. Little did he realize that the same effect, later named the Marangoni effect, might also shape how embryos develop. In March, a group of biophysicists in France reported that the Marangoni effect is responsible for the pivotal moment when a homogeneous blob of cells elongates and develops a head-and-tail axis — the first defining features of the organism it will become. The finding is part of a trend that defies the norm in biology. Typically, biologists try to characterize growth, development, and other biological processes as the result of chemical cues triggered by genetic instructions. But that picture has often seemed incomplete. Researchers now increasingly appreciate the role of mechanical forces in biology: forces that push and pull tissues in response to their material properties, steering growth and development in ways that genes cannot. Modern imaging and measurement techniques have opened scientists’ eyes to these forces by flooding the field with data that invites mechanical interpretations. “What has changed over the past decades is really the possibility to watch what happens live, and to see the mechanics in terms of cell movement, cell rearrangement, tissue growth,” said Pierre-François Lenne of Aix Marseille University, one of the researchers behind the recent study. The shift toward mechanical explanations has revived interest in pre-genetic models of biology. For example, in 1917 the Scottish biologist, mathematician, and classics scholar D’Arcy Thompson published On Growth and Form , which highlighted simil", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-genes-have-harnessed-physics-to-grow-living-things/", "timestamp": 1763400323.273251}

They're painful, kind of gross, and always unwelcome. The best lip balms can fix that. Maybe it's climate change playing cruel tricks, your skin-care routine missing the mark, or just your genetic luck of the draw. Whatever the cause, a moisturizing lip balm is the one beauty product you should always have in your back pocket (quite literally). The truth is, your lips don't need more products. The skin here is more sensitive but also self-sufficient, meaning it mostly takes care of itself unless disturbed by outside factors. So when the environment, allergies , or random skin crash-outs happen, the best lip balms can help your dry lips heal instead of just glossing over the problem. If you're ready to move on from ChapStick, I've rounded up the best lip balms that prioritize skin health. For more beauty recommendations, check out our guides to the Best Dyson Hair Tools , the Best Red Light Therapy Masks , and the Best Pimple Patches .

Native is our top pick as the best natural deodorant. Read our full thoughts on all the items we tested.", "content": "Amazon Fulton & Roark (All Scents) Walmart Amazon I know a lot about the best aluminum-free deodorants—I've tested 17 of them! In 2020, I fell for disinformation. I heard somewhere that the aluminum in my deodorant was going to give me all sorts of ailments. And it seemed credible enough that I made the switch from my trusty antiperspirant to “natural” deodorant—which is still my tried-and-true pick, Native Deodorant . Turns out, aluminum in antiperspirant isn’t really harmful . And it’s important to note that “natural” is a term that’s not regulated or defined by the Food and Drug Administration. Marketing language using the terms “natural” or “nontoxic” doesn’t necessarily mean that a product is healthy, or better or worse than another product. For purposes of this guide, “natural” means “aluminum-free.” Aluminum-free deodorant prevents odor. It doesn’t prevent you from sweating the way antiperspirant does, but it usually has some sort of agent to absorb some sweat. Antiperspirants with aluminum actively prevent you from sweating in the first place, and they’ve got fragrance to help mask any odor that escapes. I like using natural deodorant much more than traditional antiperspirants. I feel better when I sweat, I like that the ingredients don’t harsh out my sometimes-sensitive skin, and I like that I can pronounce (and usually identify) the ingredients. I promise I smell good! (I actually think I smell better than I did when I used antiperspirant, for what that’s worth.) As explained further below, aluminum is safe for most people to use. Ultimately, it comes down to whether you want to sweat a little or prevent it entirely. Both types of deodorant work to keep you smelling good and feeling fresh—they just do it in different ways.

It can carry life-threatening diseases. It’s difficult to find and hard to kill. And it’s obsessed with human blood. The Aedes aegypti is a species of mosquito that people like Tim Moore, district manager of a mosquito control district on the Western Slope of Colorado, really don’t want to see. “Boy, they are locked into humans,” Moore said. “That’s their blood meal.” This mosquito species is native to tropical and subtropical climates, but as climate change pushes up temperatures and warps precipitation patterns, the Aedes aegypti—which can spread Zika, dengue, chikungunya and other potentially deadly viruses—is on the move. It’s popping up all over the Mountain West, where conditions have historically been far too harsh for it to survive. In the last decade, towns in New Mexico and Utah have begun catching Aedes aegypti in their traps year after year, and just this summer, one was found for the first time in Idaho . Now, an old residential neighborhood in Grand Junction, Colorado, has emerged as one of the latest frontiers for this troublesome mosquito. The city, with a population of about 70,000, is the largest in Colorado west of the Continental Divide. In 2019, the local mosquito control district spotted one wayward Aedes aegypti in a trap. It was odd, but the mosquitoes had already been found in Moab, Utah, about 100 miles to the southwest. Moore, the district manager, figured they’d caught a hitchhiker and that the harsh Colorado climate would quickly eliminate the species. “I concluded it was a one-off, and we don’t have to worry too much about this,” Moore said. But then, a few years later, it happened again. They found two more of the invasive mosquito species in traps in 2023. “Coincidence is not a word you use much in science,” said Hannah Livesay, biologist at the Grand River Mosquito Control District, which is based in Grand Junction.

It was refreshing, in that context, to talk to indie app makers Omni Group about their approach to AI. The Seattle-based company makes OmniFocus , a powerful task management application long loved by reviewers and enthusiasts for its extreme flexibility. If you can imagine a way you’d like to manage your tasks, OmniFocus is flexible enough to enable it without ever feeling overly cluttered. And the plan for AI is in line with that: The development team wants to keep AI offline and private, and empower users to set it up however they like. This means the average OmniFocus user won't see any pop-ups imploring them to use AI in the application itself. AI is instead added as a potential tool for anyone who wants to build automations, or anyone who installs one of the automations built by someone else. A few people have already done exactly that; you can find a handful of such automations here . Here's how to give them a spin. To get started you'll need to be running one of Apple's new “26” operating systems—macOS, iOS, and iPadOS are all supported. These operating systems all support one of the least-discussed new features in macOS 26 —third-party applications can now utilize Foundation, the large language model that powers Apple Intelligence. To use these new features you'll also need an up-to-date version of OmniFocus, which is currently the only Omni application that supports AI.

The company, most famous for its PC gaming platform, Steam, announced a new home console called Steam Machine alongside a new version of the Steam Controller , and a new virtual reality headset dubbed the Steam Frame . The Steam Machine is a revival of Valve’s original Steam Machine , a failed attempt to bring PC gaming to the living room almost exactly 10 years ago . Now, it’s back, built on the success of the Steam Deck handheld. Valve claims the new Steam Machine is six times more powerful than the Steam Deck, and it's kind of like a compact PC. We don’t have exact measurements yet, but some early hands-on impressions have called it similar in size to the Nintendo GameCube. The Steam Machine uses a custom Zen 4 CPU from AMD, and will reportedly be sold in several memory and storage configurations, which are user-upgradable. The new Steam Controller is meant to be paired with the Steam Machine, and it has two haptic-feedback trackpads and the typical assortment of thumbsticks, buttons, triggers, and bumpers. Lastly, there’s the Steam Frame . This long-awaited VR headset is the follow-up to the Valve Index , which is over six years old. Valve calls the Steam Frame a “streaming-first” VR headset, meant to be connected to a PC for lag-free, wireless gaming. To overcome the problem of latency, the Steam Frame will come with a dedicated wireless module to connect to your PC to ensure all the visual data is transferred as smoothly as possible. The Steam Frame can also be used as a stand-alone headset, running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, meaning you’d be playing x86 games on ARM in SteamOS. It’s a tricky endeavor, but based on the success of the Steam Deck in juggling the emulation layers required, I trust Valve to do it in a way Microsoft has always struggled with.

But the US market presents unique challenges for automakers.", "content": "You’ve seen it on social media: “This $15,000 Chinese EV will DESTROY the auto industry!!” In fact, 2025 was to be the year when electric vehicles reached global price parity with gasoline cars in their segments: They’d cost the same, regardless of whether they had an engine or a battery with electric motors. In North America, that didn’t happen. As US vehicle prices continue to soar , it begs the question: When will the US get EVs that are more affordable, as cheap as gas cars, to make mass-market shoppers pay attention? They face new headwinds: The $7,500 national EV purchase incentive ended September 30. That month brought the highest ever EV sales—and many predictions of doom to follow. Let's define “affordable” as around $30,000. The average new vehicle in the US now sells for an eye-watering $50,080 , and that number will likely rise. Cheaper EVs are coming, though not as fast as they have in Europe and China. WIRED spoke to industry analysts as well as executives at Ford , General Motors , Kia, and others about how they see the market, and, crucially, when we’ll have affordable EVs in volume. Every maker is keenly aware of the global threat posed by Chinese contenders like BYD. The existential question is whether non-Chinese makers will innovate fast enough to be competitive when today’s tariff barriers ultimately fall. There are three basic ways automakers can cut EV prices and still make money: First, radically simplify the vehicle and build process; second, use far cheaper batteries; and third, make vehicles smaller. Most makers combine elements of all three approaches, but stress one or another. Ford CEO Jim Farley has been vocal about how good Chinese EVs are, after six months with a Chinese Xiaomi SU7 as his daily driver in Detroit.

Two US warrants and affidavits seen by WIRED detail how Starlink devices are allegedly being used by cybercriminals running scam compounds in Myanmar. One warrant, issued on Wednesday by US magistrate judge G. Michael Harvey, authorized the seizure of nine Starlink terminals and two Starlink accounts allegedly used in scam compounds in Payathonzu, near Three Pagodas Pass at the Myanmar-Thai border. A linked affidavit, written by FBI investigators, claims that the Starlink devices and accounts played a “substantial role” in an alleged money laundering and wire fraud operation targeting US citizens—saying Starlink parent company SpaceX should “disable service” to the devices. It also claims that at least 26 Starlink dishes appeared to be on the roofs of several buildings making up one scam center of several in the Three Pagodas Pass area. The second warrant and affidavit—which was not issued to Starlink but focused on seizing websites used in scamming—also claims that “at least” 79 Starlink dishes appear on the roofs of buildings at the notorious Tai Chang compound in Myanmar, which US officials say is controlled by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, an armed group in Myanmar that was sanctioned by the US government this week. The warrant was signed on Monday by US magistrate judge Matthew J. Sharbaugh. Both sets of legal documents cite a WIRED investigation from earlier this year, which revealed that scam compounds in Myanmar have been using Starlink for internet access.

Nearly every deal is available online, meaning you don't need to leave the couch to participate. But all the marketing and chaos can get confusing. How can you tell if a deal is worth your time and money? When do sales start and end? Do you really need that gadget? I'm a Black Friday veteran who's been shopping the sales since early childhood and writing about them since 2013, and I'm here to help. In 2025, Black Friday falls on November 28. It's followed by Cyber Monday on December 1, 2025. Most of the official sales start on Wednesday or Thanksgiving, though some of the best deals start on Friday, sometime in the early hours. I have been Black Friday shopping for over 20 years. My advice, if you're on the hunt for killer deals, is to stay up late the day before Thanksgiving to check for online sales starting around midnight Eastern time on Wednesday, November 26. WIRED will also cover major sales later in the day on Thanksgiving. Early Black Friday deals are available now , as they usually are during the weeks leading up to the event. You can—and should. We exclusively cover online deals at WIRED because the majority of Black Friday deals are available on the web. The best deals often sell out quickly, so it's a good idea to pay attention to your favorite store's sale pages (and our coverage ). Make a list of what you want to buy ahead of time—this can help you keep a clear head when it's time to start shopping. You shouldn't buy things just to buy them.

But in the years since, homegrown coffee and bubble tea brands like Luckin Coffee, Heytea, Chagee, and Mixue have gradually chipped away at Starbucks’ share of the Chinese market. Now, they are crossing the Pacific, hoping to compete with the Seattle-based coffee giant and other American beverage chains on their home turf. We wanted to experience—and taste—what these Chinese brands are offering American consumers. Over the past week, we visited two Luckin coffee shops and one HeyTea store in New York City, as well as one Chagee location in Los Angeles. What we found was a new and different beverage culture taking shape, built around speed, smartphone apps, and premium flavors. The arrival of these Chinese chains comes at a difficult moment for Starbucks. The company closed more than 600 stores worldwide this year and laid off roughly 900 corporate staffers. New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani urged people on Thursday to boycott Starbucks as unionized baristas at dozens of its US locations went on strike. And earlier this month, Starbucks announced it had agreed to sell up to 60 percent of its China business to a private equity firm. The Chinese beverage brand that appears to be expanding fastest in the US is Luckin, which has opened five locations in Manhattan this year alone. Luckin is China’s largest coffee shop chain, with more than than 26,000 stores globally. In China, there are about three Luckin coffee shops for every one Starbucks. The company was started by a former tech executive less than a decade ago and is known for its slick, app-oriented cafés. Zeyi visited one of Luckin’s outposts in the Financial District in New York City, where he got a regular-sized iced coconut latte that cost $7.02 after tax.

She said she represented a wealthy client interested in funding voting systems that would encourage bigger turnouts. Did he have any ideas? “I told her you should stay away from internet voting, because it’s really, really hard,” he says. Later he learned who had sent her. It was Bradley Tusk , a New York City political consultant and fixer for companies like Uber fending off regulation. He’d made a fortune doing that (early Uber stock helped a lot), and he was eager to spend a good chunk of it pursuing online voting technology. Tusk convinced Kiniry to work with him. At the very least, Kiniry thought, it would be a valuable research project. Today Tusk is showing off the fruits of that collaboration. His Mobile Voting Foundation is releasing VoteSecure , a cryptography-based protocol that seeks to help people securely cast their votes on iPhones and Androids. The protocol is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to test, improve upon, and build out. Two election technology vendors have already committed to using it—perhaps as early as 2026. Tusk claims that mobile voting will save our democracy. But getting it accepted by legislators and the public will be the really, really hard part. Tusk has been obsessed with mobile voting for a while. Around 2017, he began taking serious action, funding small elections that used existing technology to allow deployed military or disabled people to vote. He estimates he’s dropped $20 million so far and plans to keep shoveling cash into the effort. When I ask why, he explains that working with the government has given him a panoramic view of its failures.

Hubbard was elected to the Georgia Public Service Commission, the body that regulates the state’s electric utility. It’s the first time Democrats have won statewide seats in statewide elections in Georgia in nearly two decades. Residents have complained for years about a series of rate hikes from the PSC. But during Hubbard’s campaigning, he noticed another topic coming up again and again with his future constituents. “The number one issue was affordability,” he says. “But a very close second was data centers and the concern around them just sucking up the water, the electricity, the land—and not really paying any taxes.” Georgia has become a hot spot for data center development over the past few years: Some research indicates it’s one of the fastest-growing markets for data center development in the country (thanks, in part, to some generous tax breaks ). It’s also now a nexus for organizing against those same data centers. Community opposition to data centers, a new report finds , is on the rise across the country. And red states, including Georgia and Indiana, are leading this wave of bipartisan opposition. The new report was released by Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a Labs that tracks community opposition to data centers across the country.

Now, scientists will test whether their anti-inflammatory properties can help alleviate symptoms of long Covid.", "content": "Obesity wonder drugs Wegovy and Zepbound are already showing that they can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease in addition to helping people lose weight. Now, a US-wide trial will test whether tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, may be an effective treatment for people with long Covid . Part of a class of drugs known as GLP-1s , tirzepatide acts on receptors in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite. As a result, people shed pounds by eating less. But decreased body weight doesn’t fully explain the positive effects on the heart and kidney. Mounting evidence suggests that the drugs have a broad anti-inflammatory effect on the body—a mechanism that’s of interest for treating long Covid. As many as 20 million people in the US have experienced long Covid, a chronic condition that lasts for at least three months after an initial infection. While more than 200 symptoms of long Covid have been documented, some of the most common include coughing, shortness of breath, brain fog, fatigue, mood changes, trouble sleeping, and body aches. Scientists still don’t fully understand how and why long Covid occurs, but they’ve found persistent inflammation in many patients. This chronic inflammation may be caused by lingering traces of virus in the body or by misdirected antibodies, known as autoantibodies, that attack a person’s own cells and tissues. The hope is that tirzepatide could tamp down this inflammation to improve patients’ symptoms. “The rationale for a GLP-1 drug is its powerful body-wide and brain anti-inflammatory properties,” says Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the director of the La Jolla, California-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which is sponsoring the trial.

Carriers are legally required to unlock a phone upon request so you can switch networks, but it's a big hassle and they may have terms about how long you have to wait to ask. Try to pay full price for your phone, or make sure it specifically says it's unlocked. Buy it from the manufacturer or a third-party retailer directly, or investigate your carrier's policies for unlocking phones if they're bought on a payment plan that requires you to use its network.

Bush administration, and over the past year I've tried just about every style and brand of flat iron or straightening implement. Needless to say, I've learned a few things. First off, hair straighteners are somewhat subjective. People have different hair, and types of hair, and ideas of what they'd like their hair to look like. A high-heat titanium iron might be a godsend for someone with 4b coily hair, but could destroy another person's fine, 2a wavy hair. Conversely, that low-heat ceramic iron the wavy-haired person loves might leave another person's coiled ringlets looking like a bird's nest that's been through a hurricane. Our top pick, the 1.25-inch Paul Mitchell Smooth+ ($130) , is a Goldilocks iron. It's proven for longevity (former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has had hers since college), it's got ceramic plates that are safe even for fine hair and beginners, and the wide plates have enough power for hard-to-straighten hair but aren't so wide they inhibit maneuverability. For even more style, check out some of our many other hair-related guides, including the Best Heat Protectant Sprays , Best Dry Shampoos , Best Hair Masks , Best Hair Dryers , Best Curling Irons , and Why a Silk Pillowcase Can’t Fix Your Curly Hair Problems . Updated November 2025: We’ve added new straightening irons from L’Ange, Ya-Man, and Trademark to honorable mentions, added irons from Chi and Remington as alternatives and the Shark Glam and Chi Lava Air Glide as picks, and ensured accuracy of links and prices. Paul Mitchell Amazon Walmart There are great irons for those with wavy hair and great irons for those with curly or coily hair, but few straightening irons hit that sweet spot of being great for beginners but also strong enough for even the curliest hair.

With a lightweight frame, clicky switches, three extra programmable buttons, support for both 2.4-GHz and Bluetooth connectivity, 1,000-Hz polling (optional 8,000-Hz), and a sensor with a max resolution of 26,000 dpi, this mouse can handle any game you throw at it. The only thing you have to get past is Razer’s gamer-focused styling, which may not mesh well with every desk setup. While $100 is steep for a mouse, I’m disappointed to say that it’s becoming more common. Mice with top-of-the-line performance are priced upwards of $150 in both the ultra-lightweight gaming space and the world of productivity-oriented peripherals . Because of that, the Cobra HyperSpeed’s price doesn’t seem that bad. It’s expensive, but it’s a much better deal than higher-end models with diminishing returns. One of the main differentiators and selling points of the Cobra HyperSpeed is the use of optical components throughout, including the sensor, switches, and even the scroll wheel. Razer claims optical sensors are more accurate and longer-lasting than mechanical ones, while reducing latency when registering an input. In my experience, the optical equipment will feel just as responsive as standard mechanical switches, but with fewer anomalies. The difference is very minor, but can be noticeable if you’re looking for it. Razer Cobra HyperSpeed Rating: 9/10 Testing the mouse with multiple games ranging from Counter-Strike 2 to Helldivers 2 , the sensor felt precise and snappy. Aiming was consistent, and the response from clicks had barely any latency. The Cobra HyperSpeed will fit in most hands easily. It’s suited for claw, palm, and fingertip grips , with all of them feeling natural and comfortable, although using a palm grip could be difficult for users with large hands.

However, one area where it makes sense to eliminate chemicals is your sleep space. Organic mattresses have gained popularity in recent years due to renewed concern about the safety of the materials used and the potential health risks associated with exposure. This includes some fire-retardant materials, such as fiberglass. Some chemicals used in beds for fire prevention or even in manufacturing processes may disrupt vital organs, such as those in your endocrine, reproductive, and nervous systems. Organic mattresses are almost always certified to demonstrate health and safety standards , and offer a solution to bypassing these issues. In the course of my mattress-testing research, I came across a new-to-me brand that represents a potentially significant intersection of organic, luxurious, and supportive: Woolroom. This mattress company produces mattresses through a rather storied manufacturing process as they make their way to your door. It begins with family farms in the United Kingdom and weaves its way stateside, where the components are assembled by fourth-generation mattress makers in South Carolina. I decided to test the Woolroom Luxury Wooly hybrid mattress, and not just because it's one of the brand's bestsellers. The majority of the mattress is made from one humble material: organic wool. It also features 4,000 more coils than the Deluxe model, another all-wool offering, and I wanted to see if it delivered on motion isolation and enhanced lumbar support. In my experience with testing mattresses, organic mattresses typically incorporate the usual suspects—organic cotton, natural latex , and innerspring coils—to enhance their overall structure and supportiveness.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier). We revise the rating to REDUCE (from SELL earlier) as the stock has reduced >7% over last month and we see limited downside from hereon.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

According to a draft obtained by Reuters, the resolution allows UN member states to participate in the proposed Board of Peace, a transitional authority that would manage reconstruction and economic recovery in Gaza. It also authorizes an international stabilization force to carry out the demilitarization of Gaza — including decommissioning weapons and dismantling military infrastructure. Trump’s full 20-point plan is attached as an annex to the resolution. Russia, a veto-wielding member of the council, has signaled potential opposition. The country introduced its own rival resolution calling for the UN to explore options for an international force, rather than endorsing the US version outright. Diplomats, however, say, as stated in Reuters report, the Palestinian Authority’s public support for the US draft last week has significantly strengthened its chances of passing. The proposal has stirred controversy within Israel, where references to a potential pathway to Palestinian statehood have triggered political pushback. The latest draft says “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” contingent on reforms by the Palestinian Authority and progress on Gaza’s redevelopment.

Delhi Police said the total number of deceased has reached 15, including three partial body parts. One of the victims succumbed to injuries on Sunday, while another victim, named Vinay Pathak, died on Monday. Authorities investigating the white-collar terror module allegedly linked to the blast accused, Dr Umar Un Nabi, have found evidence of an organised internal structure, encrypted communication channels and coordinated movement of weapons, reported news agency ANI, citing official sources.  Umar had created a Signal group around three months ago using a name with special characters. He added Muzammil, Adeel, Muzaffar and Irfan to this encrypted communication platform, which investigators believe was used for internal coordination, as reported by ANI . Security agencies got the major lead after a weapon consignment, including a Krinkov rifle and a pistol, was recovered from the car of Dr Shaheen, another key suspect in the blast case. The investigation has revealed that Umar procured the weapons and handed them over to Irfan in 2024. Dr Shaheen had earlier seen the same weapons during a visit to Mufti Irfan's room with Dr Muzammil. She is also suspected of having made the highest financial contribution to the group's activities, the sources told ANI . According to the Delhi Police, the man who carried out the car blast near Red Fort was Dr Umar Un Nabi, after forensic DNA testing matched his biological sample with that of his mother. The highly sophisticated 'white-collar' terror cell, spearheaded by a group of medical practitioners and recently dismantled by the Jammu and Kashmir police, had been actively seeking a suicide bomber since last year.

In a lengthy statement on X, Yunus said that no one would be put above the law. “Today, the courts of Bangladesh have spoken with a clarity that resonates across the nation and beyond. The conviction and sentencing affirm a fundamental principle: no one, regardless of power, is above the law. This verdict offers vital, if insufficient, justice to the thousands harmed in the uprising of July and August 2024, and to the families who still carry their loss,” he said. Calling the moment as a time to rebuild democratic foundations wrecked by years of oppression, Yunus said that the ordering of lethal force against young people and children violated basic laws and the bond between the government and its citizens. “These acts outraged Bangladeshis’ core values: dignity, resilience, and commitment to justice,” he said. The special tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, finding her guilty of crimes against humanity. “Months of testimony detailed how lethal force, even from helicopters, was used against unarmed protesters.

According to a report by Lib Tech India, a consortium of academicians and activists, around 10.5 lakh workers were added to the flagship rural livelihood scheme during the same period of time.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), better known as MGNREGA or NREGA, is a flagship scheme aimed at enhancing livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.

The department is holding outreach programmes to encourage voluntary compliance, he added. Direct tax revenue, after adjusting for refunds, grew at 7% annually over 1 April to 10 November this year to ₹ 12.9 trillion – a notch above half of the ₹ 25.2 trillion direct-tax collection target for the financial year. Meeting this target will require 16% annual growth from the ₹ 21.69 trillion collected in FY25, as per actual collection figures reported by the government. A moderation in direct tax collection growth is expected this fiscal year as the government has extended relief to individuals, especially the middle class, by restructuring the tax slabs under the new income tax regime and raising the rebate available to individuals from ₹ 7 lakh to ₹ 12 lakh. The revenue impact was estimated to be ₹ 1 trillion at the time of making the FY26 budget. “Direct tax collection is up by 6.99% compared to last year, which is an encouraging trend. We hope that by the end of the year, we will be able to meet the target. Wherever we find any gap, we are connecting with taxpayers through emails. Provisions enable taxpayers to file an updated return wherever there is a gap, and there has been an encouraging response from taxpayers. We are very hopeful that we will meet the target,” said Agrawal.

His demand followed the release of a trove of documents shedding light on Epstein’s network and sparking questions about Trump’s own past interactions with the disgraced financier . In a social media post, Trump accused Democrats of using Epstein “to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.” “Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island,’” Trump wrote, adding that he would direct Attorney General Pam Bondi to “determine what was going on with them, and him.” Trump’s call for investigations came as questions resurfaced about his own relationship with Epstein. Newly released congressional documents — roughly 20,000 pages — include emails . Democrats quickly seized on the claims , saying the disclosures raise fresh concerns. The White House dismissed the emails as a “selective leak” meant to smear the President.

MHI is in the process of budgetary consultations with the finance ministry. The allocation for the scheme was a little over ₹ 2,800 crore for FY26. The scheme was launched in 2021 to provide manufacturing incentives for companies making zero-emission vehicles or their components, marking one of the biggest policy drivers for India’s emerging electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem.

Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun was sentenced to five years in prison. A three-member tribunal, led by Justice Golam Mortuza Mozumder, delivered the ruling in a court session that was broadcast live. The verdict comes while the country continues to grapple with instability following Hasina’s ouster on 5 August 2024. The case concerns crimes committed during the Hasina government’s crackdown on a student uprising in 2024, an event which claimed hundreds of lives and led to the overthrow of her 15-year rule. Both Hasina and Khan were accused of ordering the killing of hundreds of people during the student-led unrest in July and August of 2024. The International Crimes Tribunal found former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan guilty for his direct involvement in the use of deadly force against the protesters. The scale of the violence remains a contentious issue. The Health Advisor under the nation’s current interim government reported that more than 800 people were killed and approximately 14,000 were injured.

During Saturday’s broadcast, the BBC News channel repeatedly referred to the Princess of Wales as “Kate Middleton”, a name she has not formally used since her marriage to Prince William in 2011. The lapse sparked criticism on social media and drew scrutiny from royal watchers, many of whom described the oversight as disrespectful given the solemn nature of the occasion. In a statement addressing the backlash, the broadcaster said, “During our coverage of memorials to commemorate Armistice Day we mistakenly referred to Catherine, Princess of Wales as Kate Middleton ; these were errors during hours of live broadcasting for which we apologise. Throughout our Armistice Day coverage more broadly, we referred to Catherine by her correct title.” The BBC’s reference to “errors” has fuelled speculation that the misnaming occurred multiple times during the programme, which was anchored by presenter Rajini Vaidyanathan. While the corporation did not specify how many complaints were lodged, officials indicated that the criticism had been “notable enough” to trigger a clarification. Among those expressing frustration was Jim Shannon, MP for Strangford, Northern Ireland, who posted on X (formerly Twitter): “A reminder to @BBCNews to educate its broadcasters that the Princess of Wales has not been ‘Kate Middleton’ since 2011. Her correct title is Catherine, Princess of Wales. Get it right.” The broadcast in question coincided with a remembrance service held last Tuesday, during which Princess Catherine attended a ceremony at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.

The Supreme Court last week reserved its verdict on the treatment of spectrum in bankruptcy cases.

The DoT held that the spectrum is a natural resource and cannot be sold during liquidation, while the corporate affairs ministry was of the view that airwaves should be tradable so that creditors such as banks can recover their dues, the first of the two people quoted earlier said. RCom, Aircel and Videocon went bankrupt over 2018 and 2019, leaving unpaid statutory dues of over ₹ 40,000 crore.

Although prior research connected variations in the NOD2 gene to Crohn's disease , its precise function in the pathophysiology of the condition had long been unknown. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, employed machine learning techniques to find trends in the gene activity of immune cells in the gut. The mutations disrupt normal protective mechanisms that enable NOD2 proteins to prevent IBD, according to experiments conducted on lab-grown cells and samples from both healthy stomachs and digestive tracts with a kind of Crohn's illness known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). By monitoring the expression of the genes of immune cells known as macrophages, the researchers were able to identify which cells maintained gut health and which developed inflammation and caused harm. \"The gut is a battlefield, and macrophages are the peacekeepers,\" UC San Diego Gajanan Katkar said. \"For the first time, AI has allowed us to clearly define and track the players on two opposing teams,” he added. In the stomach, macrophages can alternate between two states: an inflammatory state for fighting infection and a non-inflammatory state for repairing damage. A healthy stomach is known to depend on maintaining a balance between these two states. The 53 genes that made up the study team's genetic profile regulated the macrophage status in IBD. Girdin is a protein that is produced by a gene that has been shown to support the non-inflammatory macrophage state. It turns out that NOD2 and girdin proteins cooperate to keep macrophages vigilant about dangers without becoming unduly reactive.

Masaaki Kanai, a director-general at Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is expected to meet his counterpart Liu Jinsong on Tuesday, according to media outlet Kyodo . Japan’s tourism-exposed stocks slumped on Monday after Beijing issued a travel and study alert for its citizens planning to visit Japan, triggering concerns that a drop in Chinese visitors could weigh on the country's tourism industry. Beauty and cosmetics company Shiseido, which relies heavily on Chinese spending, fell 9.08% after the alert. Whereas Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan department store chains, plunged by more than 11%, according to data compiled by CNBC . Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, fell by 5.68%. Shares of airline operator ANA Holdings declined 3.35%. Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, a rail, retail and hotel operator, was trading 1.99% lower following the news. Beijing on Friday issued a travel advisory for its citizens, saying that Takaichi’s remarks put Chinese nationals traveling to Japan at a risk. Chinese airlines responded by offering full refunds or free itinerary changes for scheduled flights to Japan. China on Thursday accused Japan of intervening in the nation's internal affairs after the Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be considered a “survival-threatening situation” for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks “egregious” and demanded a retraction.

The special tribunal found Hasina guilty of committing crime against humanity involving the mass uprising last year that killed hundreds of people and put an end to her 15-year regime. The months-long trial at the country's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT-BD) that concluded on Monday was hearing multiple charges against Sheikh Hasina and two of her aides linked to the mass uprising that saw her abandon her office in August 2024. Sheikh Hasina is now in India and was tried absentia at the court. The tribunal found the former Bangladesh PM guilty on all five charges of crimes against humanity, the Dhaka Tribune reported. The historic judgement found Hasina and the two other accused, former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, guilty of the charges. 1. Sheikh Hasina faced the charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of hundreds of people during a student-led uprising in July and August of 2024. She was charged with incitement of violence and the killing of Dhaka University students as well as others. The court found her guilty of making statements against the Rajakar sect of the society, portraying them as enemies of Mukti Yodhas. 2. It is also alleged that Sheikh Hasina in a now-surfaced telephonic conversation where she allegedly said “hang the Rajakars.” Making aggressive remarks, she said that the Chhatra League alone was enough to control the situation after which Allied organisations allegedly launched systemic attacks that injured 297 students. She is also accused of giving directions to kill the protesting students and ordering their arrest. On her instructions, agencies deployed helicopters and drones, killing 1,400 people and injuring 2,500 others. 3.

She was found guilty of crimes against humanity linked to last year’s violent anti-government protests. Hasina, who is now living in exile in India, has rejected the charges. The verdict marks a significant milestone in Bangladesh’s political history. The case also puts India in a difficult diplomatic position as Dhaka has requested Hasina’s extradition. New Delhi, however, has shown no sign of agreeing. While some Hasina-opposers posted comments like “well deserved” and “Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God)”, most comments on social media slam the ruling. “So the ‘new Bangladesh’ is moving so fast that it convicted a former PM in absentia, announced a death sentence, sent a bulldozer, and started riots all before lunch. At this rate, the only thing developing in Bangladesh right now is chaos,” commented one of them. “Bangladesh doesn't have a legitimate govt or democracy. Of course, they will convict Hasina. They're just looking for an excuse to kill her,” posted another. Another wrote, “Just an excuse to kill Sheikh Hasina .” “People who used to call Sheikh Hasina a ‘dictator’ are now watching the same government give a death sentence to a former Prime Minister as an act of political revenge. The darkest day in Bangladesh’s politics,” came from another. “India will never hand over Sheikh Hasina,” predicted another user. Another posted, “Bangladesh is now a rogue nation. predecided judgement. Now Bangladesh will become like Pakistan.” After the verdict, Hasina issued a statement and called the ruling “politically motivated”. She mentioned that the court procedure had been done in absentia, giving her no chance to defend herself. \"I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where evidence can be weighed and tested fairly,\" Hasina said.

As United Nations climate talks enter their critical second week, the next few days will determine whether that call is heeded. Countries’ climate ministers have arrived at the COP30 summit. They will need to bridge differences over key issues — how to accelerate emissions cuts, provide climate finance and facilitate trade — if they are to reach a deal by Friday. And it’s unclear whether delegates can follow through on a demand made by Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for a road map to transition away from fossil fuels. “I’ve had more conversations about fossil fuel transitioning away at this COP than any other, and now it’s time for ministers to deliver on President Lula’s call,” said Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s former special envoy for climate, in an interview. “If there’s enough political momentum behind it, with enough countries, they’ll find a place to put it.” The first week was characterized by a conciliatory mood and quick agreement on the agenda. Brazilian negotiators asked for submissions from countries about what they want to get out of COP30 in the form of “love letters,” while meetings were branded “therapy sessions.” But keeping that sense of calm will be challenging as the clock counts down and ministers spar over text. Brazil, the COP30 host, will need to balance any plan to shift away from oil, gas and coal with other core demands. The negotiating group of Like Minded Developing countries — which includes Saudi Arabia and India — is pushing for developed nations to make more concrete promises on climate finance, while China wants a discussion about unfair trade practices. There’s also “significant resistance” to the idea of a fossil fuel road map, COP30 President André Corrêa do Lago told reporters on Friday.

The President's remarks come after Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in October that he was ready to bring legislation that sanctions Russia to a vote; however, he did not commit to any specific deadline at that time, Bloomberg reported. The proposed bill would allow the Trump administration to impose tariffs of up to 500% on imports from countries that purchase Russian energy products and are not actively supporting Ukraine. This proposal also specifically targets major buyers of Russian energy. China and India are also included on that list. Trump also said on Sunday that he is considering adding Iran to the list, as he stated, “We may add Iran to that,” without providing any further details. Trump already imposed a 50% tariff on imports from India in August, including a 25% penalty for buying Russian goods.

Their vehicle crashed into an oil tanker around 1:30 am (India time). A video capturing the aftermath of the accident has gone viral on social media. The 19-second viral video shows thick black smoke rising fast from a fierce orange fire that has swallowed the vehicles. Flames spread across the road and climb the metal frames while heat distorts the air around them. The bridge is surrounded by dry rocky hills and empty brown land, which makes the scene feel even more isolated. No people appear in the frame. No rescue teams are seen. A few seconds into the video, one can hear a secondary blast, probably caused by expanding vapours. LiveMint, however, could not independently verify the authenticity of the viral video. Social media users from diverse backgrounds mourned the deaths of fellow Indians. “They set out on a sacred journey, and never returned home. May Allah grant peace to the departed souls and give strength to their families in this unbearable moment of grief,” commented one social media user. “This is absolutely heartbreaking.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.
