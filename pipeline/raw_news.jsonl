The move came after a marginal improvement in Delhi’s air quality, though the AQI has continued to oscillate between the “poor” and “very poor” categories. Parents and students said the reopening has brought back routine but not relief. Many expressed unease about children commuting and sitting in classrooms amid what they describe as “visible pollution”. “The AQI may have improved on paper, but the air still smells toxic. My son starts coughing the moment he steps out. I’m not fully convinced schools should have reopened so quickly,” said Mamta Agrawal, a parent from Noida. Others felt academic continuity needed priority. “Children can’t keep shifting between online and offline modes. My daughter’s focus breaks every time this happens,” said Yogendra Yadav, a parent from East Delhi . Teachers voiced concerns about classroom ventilation and preparedness. “Not all schools have air purifiers, and younger students often either forget masks or are not comfortable using them. We worry about prolonged exposure,” said Sumit Sharma, a government school teacher in North Delhi. “It’s definitely challenging for us as teachers. Online classes demand that we constantly work to keep students focused on a screen, and that itself is tiring. Now that offline classes are resuming, we have to divide our attention between students sitting in front of us and those who may still be joining remotely. Managing both formats together affects the pace of teaching, and it becomes difficult to ensure every child is engaged and learning equally,” said the Delhi government school teacher.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January. Christmas Eve on December 24 is not a universal holiday but is often observed in regions with Christian-majority populations or in schools that follow specific cultural calendars. This softer closure then leads into December 25, Christmas Day, which is a national holiday across all educational institutions in the country. Nagaland hosts the Hornbill Festival in the first week of December, drawing significant participation from schools through cultural showcases and educational visits. Goa marks the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in early December, a major religious observance that can lead to localised school holidays.

B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government.

Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers. Business groups in London, however, have expressed concern that these sharper controls are coming at a cost.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges?

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Referring to allegations that the government was not creating enough jobs, Saha said as many as 20,181 unemployed youths have been appointed in different government departments since 2018. Besides, around 5,000 people have been appointed on a contractual basis to assist the government workforce, he said, adding that the process to fill 1,733 teaching posts has already begun. “It shows the government is trying to address the unemployment problem. There will be no compromise in appointments in the health and family welfare and education departments,” he said.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

Once considered the obvious choice, the question in students’ minds today is, Does going to the US justify the cost and uncertainty?

The final week before CAT exam isn’t about doing more; it’s about doing better. What you choose to study, what you consciously drop, and how you prepare mentally can make all the difference on test day. At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with. Review your notes or bookmarked questions instead of opening new material. For Quant, focus on accuracy with medium-difficulty questions rather than chasing complex ones.

For DILR, solve one or two sets daily, focusing on identifying patterns quickly rather than completing entire mocks. Many aspirants make the mistake of cramming in too many mocks this week. Instead, take one or two full-length tests, preferably in the same time slot as your actual exam, to simulate conditions and fine-tune your time management. Spend more time analysing than attempting. Look at where you’re losing time or marks and adjust your approach.

The goal isn’t to solve everything; it’s to maximise your score in areas of strength. Last week is as much a psychological game as an academic one.

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand. Canada is projected to see a 54 per cent drop in new study permit issuances in 2025 and 30 per cent decline in PGWP issuances. Australia and the UK continue to host steady numbers but face hesitancy due to compliance rules and rising living expenses. Countries offering policy stability and stronger workforce integration are gaining traction. Germany has crossed 4 lakh international students in the 2024/25 winter semester, supported by dual-citizenship reforms. France aims to welcome 30,000 Indian students by 2030, pairing this target with clearer employment pathways.

Offering two board exams to students is a recommendation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, and is intended to “eliminate the high-stakes nature” of these exams. The NEP suggested possibilities including giving students the option of taking the exams on two occasions during a school year, and a system of semester exams. “Two board exams is a policy obligation which all of us have to fulfill together.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

Every line holds value, and many questions are hidden within single sentences. –Highlight important points. Underline names of scientists, examples, dates, and figures. Create your own questions. Frame True/False or Correct/Incorrect questions from NCERT. –Pay attention to keywords like only, generally, due to, must, first, last, largest, etc., as these often form the basis of Assertion & Reasoning questions. –Revise regularly.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

Speaking to The Indian Express in an earlier interaction , he noted that many students are increasingly gravitating toward IT, finance, and consulting roles, often prioritising higher starting packages and office-based work environments. Against this backdrop, IIT Roorkee’s BTech placements from 2023 to 2025 reflect both these changing student choices and the institute’s steady performance across hiring cycles. Available institute data indicate consistent recruiter participation, top packages, and strong hiring across technology, analytics, and related domains. Data from 2023 onward shows that Computer Science and related technology roles continued to fetch the top salary packages for IIT Roorkee students. In 2023, BTech students received around 500 job offers, including an exceptional domestic package of Rs 1.3 crore and an international offer of over Rs 1.06 crore. Consulting, data sciences, core tech engineering, and analytics roles were among the highest-paying categories. The 2024 placement season recorded over 600 offers, marking a year-on-year rise in hiring volume. The highest domestic package remained Rs 1.3 crore, matching the previous year. International offers — although limited at four major roles — reflected strong niche demand. Media reports indicate that early-phase trends in 2025 also show similar salary patterns, with top domestic packages again reaching Rs 1.3 crore, underscoring steady compensation benchmarks for CSE-related roles.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

To recap: In a bare bones blog post last Wednesday, Mixpanel chief executive Jen Taylor announced that the company had detected an unspecified security incident on November 8 that affected some of its customers, but didn’t say how they were affected, nor how many, only that Mixpanel had taken a range of security actions to “eradicate unauthorized access.” Mixpanel’s CEO, Jen Taylor, did not respond to multiple emails from TechCrunch, which included over a dozen questions about the company’s data breach. We asked Taylor if the company had received any communication from the hackers, such as a demand for money, along with other specific questions about the breach, including whether Mixpanel employee accounts were protected with multi-factor authentication . One of its affected customers is OpenAI, which published its own blog post two days later, confirming what Mixpanel had failed to explicitly say in its own post, that customer data had been taken from Mixpanel’s systems. OpenAI said it was affected by the breach because it relied on software provided by Mixpanel to help understand how OpenAI users interact with certain parts of its website, such as its developer documentation . OpenAI users affected by the Mixpanel breach are likely to be developers whose own apps or websites rely on OpenAI’s products to work.

The new “ultra-fast” delivery option will allow Amazon to better compete with services like DoorDash, Uber Eats, and Instacart. Customers will be able to order a range of different items, including milk, eggs, fresh produce, toothpaste, cosmetics, pet treats, diapers, paper products, electronics, seasonal items, over-the-counter medicines, chips, dips, and more, according to the company. Prime members can choose the fast delivery option for a $3.99 fee per order, while non-Prime members will have to pay $13.99. Orders below $15 will include a small basket fee of $1.99. Customers in Seattle and Philadelphia can now check the Amazon app and homepage and look for the “30-Minute Delivery” option in the navigation bar to see if it’s available in their area. After placing an order, customers can track their deliveries and tip drivers through the app. “Amazon is utilizing specialized smaller facilities designed for efficient order fulfillment, strategically placed close to where Seattle- and Philadelphia-area customers live and work,” Amazon explained in a blog post . “This approach prioritizes the safety of employees picking and packing orders, reduces the distance delivery partners need to travel, and enables faster delivery times.” The move follows Amazon’s launch of a 15-minute delivery service in the United Arab Emirates in October. The company said at the time that some customers received their orders in as little as six minutes. The launch of the new service marks Amazon’s latest effort to enter the fast delivery market in the United States. In 2014, the e-commerce giant introduced a “Prime Now” service that offered one-hour deliveries, but the company discontinued it in 2021.

Simular is an interesting agentic startup because unlike others, it isn’t trying to control the browser but the PC itself. (Agentic AI refers to systems that can autonomously complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.) “We can literally move the mouse on the screen and do the click. So it’s more capable of doing, repeating whatever human activities in the digital world,” co-founder CEO Ang Li told TechCrunch, offering the example of copying and pasting data into a spreadsheet. On Monday it announced the release of its 1.0 version for Mac OS. But it’s also working with Microsoft to develop an agent for Windows. The startup is one of five agentic companies accepted into the Windows 365 for Agents program Microsoft announced in mid November. (The others are Manus AI, Fellou, Genspark, and TinyFish.) As for the timeline for the Windows version, Li was vague except to say it promises to be as or more popular than the Mac version. Another reason to watch Simular is the bona fides of the founders: Li is a continuous learning scientist who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, where he met his co-founder, reinforcement learning specialist Jiachen Yang. While their team published their fair share of papers, the work wasn’t strictly academic, Li said. It was intended to improve Google products, including Waymo. That AI product background is helpful because, before the agentic future of Silicon Valley’s dreams can materialize, there are a host of technical problems to solve. One of the biggest is that LLMs hallucinate some percentage of the time.

The cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia’s chips. AWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company’s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS. AWS says the system is more than four times faster, with four times more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips — 10 times the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company. Perhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more. It is, obviously, in AWS’s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscience way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too. AWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan’s LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said.

AWS announced multiple new AgentCore features on Tuesday during the company’s annual AWS re:Invent conference . The company announced new tools for managing AI agent boundaries, agent memory capabilities, and agent evaluation features. One upgrade is the introduction of Policy in AgentCore. This feature allows users to set boundaries for agent interactions using natural language. These boundaries integrate with AgentCore Gateway, which connects AI agents with outside tools, to automatically check each agent’s action and stop those that violate written controls. Policy allows developers to set access controls to certain internal data or third-party applications like Salesforce or Slack. These boundaries can also include telling an AI agent they can automatically issue refunds up to $100 but must bring a human in the loop for anything larger, David Richardson, vice president of AgentCore, told TechCrunch. The company also announced AgentCore Evaluations, which is a suite of 13 pre-built evaluation systems for AI agents that monitor factors including correctness, safety, and tool selection accuracy, among others. This also allows developers to have a head start in building their own evaluation features as well. “That one is really going to help address the biggest fears that people have [with] deploying agents,” Richardson said about the new evaluation capabilities. “[It’s] a thing that a lot of people want to have but is tedious to build.” AWS also announced that it’s building a memory capability into the agent platform, AgentCore Memory.

The launch comes as Mistral, which develops open-weight language models and Europe-focused AI chatbot Le Chat, has appeared to be playing catch up with some of Silicon Valley’s closed-source frontier models. Open-weight models release their model weights publicly so anyone can download and run them. Meanwhile, closed-source models, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, keep their weights proprietary and only provide access through APIs or controlled interfaces. The two-year-old startup, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, has raised about $2.7 billion to date at a $13.7 billion valuation — peanuts compared to the numbers that competitors like OpenAI ($57 billion raised at a $500 billion valuation) and Anthropic ($45 billion raised at a $350 billion valuation) are pulling. But Mistral is trying to prove that bigger isn’t always better — especially for enterprise use cases. “Our customers are sometimes happy to start with a very large [closed] model that they don’t have to fine-tune … but when they deploy it, they realize it’s expensive, it’s slow,” Guillaume Lample, co-founder and chief scientist at Mistral, told TechCrunch. “Then they come to us to fine-tune small models to handle the use case [more efficiently].” “In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,” Lample continued.

As part of the expansion, the Indian telecom ministry is requiring companies that buy or trade used phones to verify every device through a central database of IMEI numbers. This comes in addition to a recent directive ordering smartphone manufacturers to preinstall the government’s Sanchar Saathi app on all new handsets and push it onto existing devices through a software update. Reuters first reported the news on Monday, which was later confirmed by the ministry in a public statement. Launched in 2023 , the Sanchar Saathi portal allows users to block or trace lost and stolen phones. The system has blocked more than 4.2 million devices and traced 2.6 million more devices, per government data. The system expanded earlier this year with the release of a dedicated Sanchar Saathi app in January, which the government says helped recover more than 700,000 phones, including 50,000 in October alone. The Sanchar Saathi app has since gained broad adoption. The app has been downloaded nearly 15 million times and saw more than three million monthly active users in November — up more than 600% from its launch month, according to marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Web traffic to Sanchar Saathi has also surged, with monthly unique visitors rising by more than 49% year-over-year, per Sensor Tower data shared with TechCrunch.

Gradium has developed audio language AI models designed to deliver voice at scale with ultra-low latency — essentially, AI voices that respond almost instantly. It was founded just a few months ago, in September, by Kyutai founding member Neil Zeghidour, who cut his teeth working with voice models as a researcher at Google DeepMind. The startup’s goal, it says, is to make voice models speedier and more accurate for developers. And, as a European startup, it launched with multilingual support out of the gate: English, French, German, Spanish, and Portuguese, with additional languages coming. Of course, Gradium is entering a race with plenty of competition. For starters, the frontier LLM companies like OpenAI, Anthropic , Meta Llama , and Mistral all have voice, speech recognition, and multimodal models.

Apple Intelligence, the company’s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from “underwhelming” to outright alarmed. Its first months were some of the roughest.

The promise is AI that’s uniquely helpful because it knows you. But the risk is AI that feels more like surveillance than service. In a recent episode of the Limitless podcast, Robby Stein, VP of Product for Google Search, explained that Google’s AI tends to field more queries that are advice-seeking or those where the user is looking for recommendations — and these types of questions are more likely to benefit from more subjective responses. “We think there’s a huge opportunity for our AI to know you better and then be uniquely helpful because of that knowledge,” Stein said in the interview. “And one of the things we talked about at [Google’s developer conference] I/O was how the AI can get a better understanding of you through connected services like Gmail.” Google has been integrating AI into its apps for some time, starting back when Gemini was still known as Bard . More recently, it began pulling personal data into another AI product, Gemini Deep Research. And Gemini is now infused into Google Workspace apps like Gmail , Calendar and Drive. But as Google integrates more personal data into its AI — spanning your emails, documents, photos, location history , and browsing behavior — the line between a helpful assistant and an intrusive one becomes increasingly blurred. And unlike opt-in services, avoiding Google’s data collection may become harder as AI becomes central to its products. Google’s pitch is that this deep personalization makes the AI far more useful. The idea is that Google’s AI technology could learn from the user’s interactions across Google’s various services, then use that understanding to make more personalized recommendations. For instance, if it learned that a user likes particular products or brands, the AI responses might favor those in its recommendations. That, Stein said, would be", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/one-of-googles-biggest-ai-advantages-is-what-it-already-knows-about-you/", "timestamp": 1764696707.2509665}

Just over a year after adding climate risk scores, Zillow has removed them from more than 1 million listings after real estate agents complained that the information was causing them to lose sales. Zillow first added the data to the site in September 2024, saying that more than 80% of buyers consider climate risks when purchasing a new home. But last month, following objections from the California Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS), Zillow removed the listings’ climate scores. In their place is a subtle link to their records at First Street, the climate risk analytic startup that provides the data. “When buyers lack access to clear climate-risk information, they make the biggest financial decision of their lives while flying blind,” First Street spokesperson Matthew Eby told TechCrunch via email. “The risk doesn’t go away; it just moves from a pre-purchase decision into a post-purchase liability.” First Street’s climate risk scores first appeared on Realtor.com in 2020, where they remain. They  also still appear on Redfin and and Homes.com. The New York-based startup has raised more than $50 million from investors including General Catalyst, Congruent Ventures, and Galvanize Climate Solutions, according to PitchBook. Art Carter, the CRMLS CEO, told The New York Times that “displaying the probability of a specific home flooding this year or within the next five years can have a significant impact on the perceived desirability of that property.” He also questioned the accuracy of First Street’s data, saying he didn’t think that areas which haven’t flooded in the last 40 to 50 years were likely to flood in the next five. This isn’t the first time real estate agents have complained about climate risk scores. Last year, when Zillow introduced the feature, one agent in Massachusetts told the Boston Globe that the risk scores were “putting thoughts in people’s minds about my listing that normally wouldn’t be there.” First Street defend", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/01/zillow-drops-climate-risk-scores-after-agents-complained-of-lost-sales/", "timestamp": 1764696707.392848}

According to Shopify’s status page , the company has found and fixed the issue. The disruption is particularly problematic given that customers were actively searching for deals on Cyber Monday, one of the busiest online shopping days of the year. Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company reports Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S. The issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions. Shopify’s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it’s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today’s outage. The exact number of affected merchants is unclear. However, Downdetector , a website that tracks user-submitted reports about website issues, noted there were about 4,000 outage incidents.

The ecommerce giant announced the second generation of its Nova AI models at re:Invent, a company conference held in Las Vegas. The models are nowhere near as popular as those offered by rivals like OpenAI and Google, but Amazon’s plan to make them highly customizable could see them gain traction with its cloud users. Amazon detailed two improved large language models, Nova Lite and Nova Pro, a new real-time voice model called Nova Sonic, and a more experimental model called Nova Omni that performs a simulated kind of reasoning using images, audio, and video as well as text. The new models are being made available today to a limited number of customers. More significantly, given the importance of its cloud business, Amazon is releasing a tool called Nova Forge that will let customers create specialized frontier models by adding their own training data to unfinished versions of the Nova 2 Lite and Pro models. It is already possible to fine-tune off-the-shelf AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT. But Amazon’s approach lets customers add data at various stages of model training, including the process of building the base model, a stage known as custom pretraining that is normally reserved for large AI labs. “Everyone is looking for a frontier model that's an expert in their domain,” Rohit Prasad, who leads Amazon’s AI efforts, told WIRED ahead of today’s announcements. Prasad says that Amazon developed the technologies behind Nova Forge to empower internal teams, including those developing Alexa and AI agents to build custom models. “This is essentially a new open training paradigm,” he says. One customer that has tested the approach is Reddit , which used Nova Forge to create a custom model to identify content that breaks the platform’s rules.

But AWS has also been building in-house foundation models, new chips, massive data centers, and agents meant to keep enterprise customers locked inside its ecosystem. The company believes these offerings will give it an edge as businesses of all shapes and sizes deploy AI in the real world. WIRED sat down with AWS CEO Matt Garman ahead of the company’s annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas to discuss his AI vision, and how he plans to extend Amazon’s lead in the cloud market over its fast-rising competitors, Microsoft and Google. Garman is betting that AI is a service that AWS can deliver more cheaply and reliably than its rivals. Through Bedrock, Amazon’s platform for building AI apps, he says customers can access a variety of AI foundation models while keeping the familiar data controls, security layers, and reliability that AWS is known for. If that pitch holds up, it could help AWS dominate in the AI era. “Two years ago, people were building AI applications. Now, people are building applications that have AI in them,” said Garman, arguing that AI is becoming a feature inside large products rather than a standalone experiment. “That's the platform that we've built, and that's where I think you see AWS really start to take the lead.” Many of the announcements at this year’s re:Invent fall along these lines. Amazon unveiled new, cost-efficient AI models in its Nova series; agents that can work autonomously on software development and cybersecurity tasks; as well as a fresh offering, Forge, that lets enterprises cheaply train AI models on their own data.

The billionaire philanthropist, investor, and longtime advocate for women’s and girls’ rights is the rare example of an über-wealthy American who takes seriously the responsibility that their wealth confers. In Gates’ case, she’s now channeling much of that responsibility—and billions of her own dollars—into Pivotal Ventures, a collective of organizations focused on advancing women’s interests in the US and around the world. Most recently, Pivotal announced $250 million in awards to women’s health organizations in 22 countries. Given the Trump administration’s ongoing assault on women’s interests, and diversity writ large, as well as the dystopian cuddle puddle taking place between tech industry leaders (Gates’ ex-husband, Bill, has been a part of that shift) and President Trump, it felt like a particularly salient moment to check in with Gates about, well, all of it. From her own path through the masculine “debate club” of Big Tech to the billionaire boys who aren’t giving away the big bucks, I found myself pleasantly surprised, and even a little bit inspired, by Gates’ candor in discussing the very real challenges of this particular moment.

The hack relies on an exploit that tricks the iPhone’s operating system into thinking it’s running on an iPad . That unlocks smallish tweaks such as a landscape Home Screen, an iPad-style app switcher, and more Dock items. But it also provides transformative changes such as running desktop-grade apps that aren’t available for iPhone, full windowed multitasking , and optimal external display support.

It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro.

My favorite feature of the Vego is the Express Mode; some of these grind-and-dry recyclers can be loud, and this short cycle ensures you won't have to listen to whirring or grinding noises for more than a couple of hours.

The company says the feature was not widely used.", "content": "Netflix has updated its service so that it will no longer support casting a streaming video to a TV from a mobile device. If you’re watching a show on your phone, you’ll no longer be able to easily cast it onto your TV and keep watching. Instead, Netflix is prioritizing its TV app, which means you’ll need to grab your TV remote and use the app to play content, or even pause or rewind the show. Volume controls, playback buttons, closed captioning controls, or any other settings won’t be able to be controlled by your mobile device anymore if you’re streaming on the TV. The change was first spotted and reported on by Android Authority , and the news has garnered lots of scorn from users in places like Reddit . The change eliminates a workaround that a lot of people use for either convenience—they can browse Netflix on their phone, then send something to the TV once they’ve chosen what to watch—or because the only account they have access to is authenticated on their phone, and they may not be able to log into the TV app. “Why would they take away features that are incredibly useful? Why would they make the experience worse?” reads the top Reddit comment on the post sharing the Android Authority article. A Netflix representative, answering questions from WIRED via email, says Netflix is ending support for mobile device playback control because it was not a feature that enough members use. The representative says that Netflix sometimes has to retire features that are no longer widely used so that it can invest in those that provide more value. Netflix wouldn’t share any information about how many people used the casting feature, or what resources the feature was taking up compared to anything else the platform offers.

It had been $750 on Black Friday and all weekend, and it's now been discounted by an extra $50. It's one of the best Cyber Monday tech deals I've seen, as well as one of the overall best Cyber Monday deals out there right now.

Microsoft Amazon Walmart Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus) Best Buy (15-inch) Beyond just the price, though, what makes this one of my favorite laptops? My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which is a bit taller than your average laptop screen. I've always found this to be a very productive screen to work on, and I found myself missing it whenever I switch back to a 16:10 display. Speaking of the display, this is one of the few laptops at this price that comes with a 120-Hz refresh rate, which goes a long way toward making the whole laptop experience feel smoother and more responsive. The one catch is it only comes with 256 GB of storage. The 16 GB of memory is great, but you might want some extra storage, but the 512 GB model at Amazon is sold out (and is not as strong of a deal at other retailers). To me, it feels almost absurd that you can buy a laptop this premium for only $700. Despite being out for well over a year at this point, it still gets excellent, all-day battery life and is surprisingly powerful. I wouldn't try to play modern games on it, but you'll be surprised by just how snappy the performance will feel in day-to-day work. The MacBook Air for $750 is close, yes, but features like the high refresh rate make the Surface Laptop stand out even more.

Updated December 1: We've updated pricing on these deals, and added two new deals for the LG S95TR and Sony Bravia Theater Quad. Yamaha Amazon Walmart Our favorite soundbar for most people, the Yamaha SR-C30A, hits its lowest price in the last 30 days for Cyber Monday at just under $210 from Amazon . What it lacks in high-end features, it more than makes up for with its super simple and compact setup, and the sound quality is more than good enough for your weekly movie night. It even has a wireless subwoofer, so you get all the benefits of dedicated bass without having to run wires across your living room. Sony Amazon B&H An upgraded pick for the discerning ear, the Sony Bravia Theater System 6 is marked down by 25% on Amazon for Cyber Monday . This 5.1 surround system is helmed by an impressive soundbar in a surprisingly compact package, assisted by a chunky subwoofer and two surround speakers. While it lacks upfiring speakers, it makes up for it with excellent detail and smooth transitions around the system. If you crave real surround with physical speakers to compliment your soundbar, this is a great pick. JBL Amazon Walmart JBL Another option with an included subwoofer that's a little more budget-friendly, the JBL Bar 500MK2 boasts a big, bassy subwoofer that helps round out the physical limitations most soundbars fight against.

This one offered by Amazon , for example, is a Gorilla Tag bundle, which is currently the most popular game on the platform. It's also a free game to download, but the bundle gets you in-game content (1,000 shiny rocks, for those curious). You might not want in-game content for a game you've never played. For my money, Walmart is the place to buy the Quest 3S right now. Its bundle comes with Batman: Arkham Shadow , a $50 game. Meta is also selling this bundle for the same price directly from its own storefront. Like the other bundles, this one comes with 128 GB of storage, as well as a three-month free trial of Meta Horizon+, which gives you access to lots of premium apps and games designed for VR. Meanwhile, Best Buy is offering a bundle with the game The Walking Dead: Sinners & Saints for the same price of $249. That's a $20 game. But it also comes with a $50 Best Buy e-gift card.

We've also found the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals and deals under $100 , if you need to scoop a last-minute holiday gift. Oral-B Amazon Walmart Target Oral-B's Pro 1000 is a classic case of “if it ain't broke, don't fix it,” as its simple design has been going strong for nearly 13 years. This oscillating electric toothbrush has three settings, including Daily Clean, Whiten, and Sensitive. Paired with the smaller, circular brush head, it's meant to get into all the nooks and crannies standard brush heads can't reach. A timer runs for two minutes, focusing in 30-second intervals signaled by a pulse for each section of your mouth. WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane found it handy that the Pro 1000's motor didn't make holding the device uncomfortable, and the continuous brushing past the timer routine convenient for when you have to do an intense pre-dentist-visit clean. Philips Amazon Best Buy Target I'm terrified of cavities (and the dental bill that would follow a filling), so I rely on the Philips Sonicare 4100 to prevent them.

Norway, however, is bucking the trend—thanks to a tax incentive system that will soon be rolled back.", "content": "The slump does not stop. Tesla sales in Europe slumped again in November 2025, confirming a negative trend that has been going on for more than a year. Data reported by Reuters shows monthly registrations of Tesla automobiles—an accurate way of measuring sales—halved compared to the same month in 2024 in the continent's main markets: down 58 percent in France, minus 59 percent in Sweden, and  down 49 percent in Denmark. In Germany, where the Elon Musk -controlled automaker has its only European plant, on the outskirts of Berlin, recorded just 750 vehicles sold in October, less than half the number sold a year earlier. The big exception to this downward trend is in Norway, where registrations of Tesla cars nearly tripled, to 6,215 units. The numbers for the first 10 months of 2025 expose a structural crisis. Tesla lost about 30 percent of European sales compared to the same period in 2024, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association , the body that groups the industry's manufacturers on the Continent. Tesla's market share in the electric car segment fell from 12.6 percent in May 2024 to 7.2 percent in May 2025, according to analysis by Schmidt Automotive. Volkswagen took the lead among electric vehicle manufacturers by selling 133,465 units in the first six months of the year versus Tesla's 108,878, and Chinese manufacturer BYD sold more than twice as many cars as its US rival in October. The reasons for the decline are many. Musk's political stances have alienated a significant portion of his European customer base, particularly in Germany where the entrepreneur has publicly supported Alternative für Deutschland, Germany's far-right party known as AfD. Musk's virtual participation in an AfD election rally in January 2025, during which he called on Germans to overcome guilt over their Nazi past, triggered a wave of boycotts.

I'll also issue the caveat that you lose all your viewing data and tailored suggestions if you sign up anew. But times and wallets are tight! And $3 HBO Max sounds pretty good.

Right now, you can get most of Aura's frames on sale for anywhere from $30 to $60 off, depending on which frame you choose. Curious about the difference between Aura's frames? All of them will include the same great app experience and unlimited free photo storage, two of Aura's hallmarks, and the main difference is the screen size and the frame style. No matter which frame style you choose, I've tested all of the on-sale options and can attest they're beautiful to look at and well-made for any flat surface you want to place them on.

Both the regular frame design and the mat design are discounted to $139, though that's a larger discount for the Carver Mat since it usually retails for more. The Carver Mat is prettier with its mat-style frame, and both Carver designs sit in landscape mode only but can show portrait-oriented photos side-by-side.

It's not without its quirks ( read the pitching tips ), but if you want something more than a tarp, that still weighs just 26 ounces (740 grams), this one is hard to beat. It's well ventilated for a single-walled tent, with the ability to raise up the front door when weather is nice.

The first significant snowfall of the year just hit much of the country, from Philly to Boston to Kansas City . But not only will grilling season be back very soon, but the holidays are also actually a great time to cook outdoors , since smoking a big piece of meat leaves your oven free for sides. Which is why we're scoping some sales on our favorite grills this Cyber Monday. Most of the products on our list of the best grills are currently marked with some type of discount, though many of them have been priced that way for a while. Among the ones actually discounted, you find the T raeger Woodridge Pro that we reviewed very positively below $1,000 on Amazon , which is $200 off the price we normally see it at. Amazon has a ton of other big Traeger discounts , too, including $100 off the budget Pro Series 22 and $130 off the larger Pro 34 , which has 800-plus inches of cooking area. Traeger Amazon Home Depot You'll see a lot of sales marked for Weber products like the classic Original Kettle , but it's actually been selling for $142 for a long time, according to our tracking. You can probably wait for spring on that one. However, Recteq is another brand offering the biggest discounts we've seen recently. The Flagship 1600 is a smoker and grill with massive grate space (1600 square inches, as the name implies) and has impressive specs, including the ability to go low and slow for 40 hours nonstop with a full hopper. It also has wifi connectivity and can get up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit for searing steaks and burgers. The Cyber Monday price is $1,250 , the lowest we've tracked, and it's often sold for its full $1,600 list price.

Any such discounts are few and far between, and sell out almost immediately thanks to our old friends, the scalpers (shakes fist).

But if you're shopping for a Pokémon fan, there are still some Cyber Monday discounts worth perusing that'll make great gifts, and I've rounded them up below.

This little Pikachu Squishmallow can be clipped onto either, and might I say that it'd look mighty fine attached to a stocking on the morning of a certain holiday? I can attest to the clip's durability—I have a similar plush charm from the brand that I've toted to music festivals across the country. It's still going strong despite putting it through situations no keychain should be forced to endure. Lite Brite Amazon This Lite Brite comes with six Pokémon-themed templates and 1,000 pegs for endless creativity.

The Arlo app is swift to load, offers rich notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. TP-Link Amazon B&H TP-Link As my top pick of the best indoor security cameras , the Tapo C120 has everything. It records video at up to 2K resolution, supports two-way audio (with a slight lag), and supports up to 512-GB microSD cards for local recording. There's impressive color night vision, on-device smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) without a subscription, and it even has an IP66 rating, which means you can also use it outdoors (provided you can run the power cable). We like this camera at its usual price (it hovers around $35), so this is a deal worth bagging.

Probably what you need to do is spend a lot more time with the one you have, but if buying a new camera makes you feel like maybe you're getting better at photography, far be it for me to stop you. Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media , a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here . The findings bring up questions about who exactly has access to footage collected by Flock surveillance cameras and where people reviewing the footage may be based. Flock has become a pervasive technology in the US, with its cameras present in thousands of communities that cops use every day to investigate things like carjackings. Local police have also performed numerous lookups for ICE in the system. Companies that use AI or machine learning regularly turn to overseas workers to train their algorithms, often because the labor is cheaper than hiring domestically. But the nature of Flock’s business—creating a surveillance system that constantly monitors US residents’ movements—means that footage might be more sensitive than other AI training jobs. Flock’s cameras continuously scan the license plate, color, brand, and model of all vehicles that drive by. Law enforcement are then able to search cameras nationwide to see where else a vehicle has driven. Authorities typically dig through this data without a warrant, leading the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation to recently sue a city blanketed in nearly 500 Flock cameras. Broadly, Flock uses AI or machine learning to automatically detect license plates, vehicles, and people , including what clothes they are wearing, from camera footage.

Let's move on.", "content": "My little theory is that the concept of “imprinting” in psychology can just as easily be applied to programming: Much as a baby goose decides that the first moving life-form it encounters is its parent, embryonic programmers form ineradicable attachments to the patterns and quiddities of their first formative language. For many people, that language is Ruby. It’s often credited with making programming “click”; imprintees speak of it with a certain indebtedness and affection. I get that. I wrote my first “Hello world” in an awful thing called Java, but programming only began to feel intuitive when I learned JavaScript (I know, I know) and OCaml—both of which fundamentally shaped my tastes. I arrived somewhat late to Ruby. It wasn’t until my fourth job that I found myself on a team that mainly used it. By then, I’d heard enough paeans to its elegance that I was full of anticipation, ready to be charmed, to experience the kind of professional satori its adherents described. My dislike for it was immediate. To arrive at a language late is to see it without the forgiving haze of sentimentality that comes with imprinting—the fond willingness to overlook a flaw as a quirk. What I saw wasn’t a bejeweled tool but a poor little thing that hadn’t quite gotten the news that the world of programming had moved on. Ruby was created in 1995 by the Japanese programmer Yukihiro Matsumoto, affectionately called “Matz.” Aside from creating the only major programming language to have originated outside the West, this Osaka-born practicing Mormon is also known for being exceptionally nice, so much so that the Ruby community adopted the motto MINASWAN, for “Matz Is Nice And So We Are Nice.” Befitting this, as well as its pretty name, Ruby is easy on the eyes. Its syntax is simple, free of semicolons or brackets. More so even than Python —a language known for its readability—Ruby reads almost like plain English.

Those extra thumb buttons can be lifesavers in competitive games. Better buttons: They should also have higher-quality buttons, and more of them, than a standard office mouse. The left and right buttons should have individual switches inside, tensioned to register rapid clicks and reinforced to withstand more frequent clicks than a normal mouse.

Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location.

KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life , and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320 , a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy.

The original V1 came out in 2006 , and the nameplate has been under constant production since. In that time, the DeathAdder has maintained its shape and ergonomics, but nearly everything else has changed. The mouse’s weight has halved, its polling rate has increased eightfold, and the maximum dots per inch (dpi) has increased by 25 times. To add to that, the new DeathAdder V4 Pro packs all of this into a wireless design. It's a great example of how far mouse technology has come over the past two decades. Over the years, I’ve watched mice progress in every way. With higher-performance sensors, improved switches, higher polling rates, and lower weights, it’s hard to argue that a mouse from 2006 is still competitive. At the same time, not all of those specs matter much to the average user. Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro Rating: 9/10 Sure, there’s a difference between 1,000- and 8,000-Hz polling, or 0.1 and 0.2 milliseconds of latency, but it's marginal compared to a new switch that feels better to press, a body that’s sturdy during use, or a design that saves 10 grams of weight. Time and time again, I find that the physical aspects of a mouse will have a much more direct and tangible impact on the user experience than any high-end internals. That’s what the DeathAdder V4 Pro gets right: It feels good to use. The buttons are snappy with a short travel distance but provide just enough resistance that resting your hand on them doesn’t risk a mis-input. The mouse wheel feels tight and notchy, with short ratchets that easily snap into place as you scroll. The overall shape is slightly sculpted, with a subtle ergonomic curve on either side. The mouse feels agile and responsive—it fits into your hand, but isn’t so sculpted that your hand sinks into it. ( Logitech's MX Master line does the inverse perfectly, which makes it specialized for productivity , but not ideal for high-intensity gaming.)

A 29-year-old teacher and musician from Richmond, Virginia, Yongbanthom didn’t know much about Facebook Dating before creating a profile in 2023. Still, his matches sort of made sense. “It’s just a mom thing to be on Facebook, I guess,” he says of the perception around the social network . What Yongbanthom couldn’t figure out was why he also kept matching with people who were so far away. “No one is ever near me, which is interesting given there are so many users on Facebook Dating.” Twenty-one million users, actually. In November, for the first time since its launch in 2019, Meta shared with WIRED user information about Facebook Dating, and the figures landed to the sound of collective astonishment. Suddenly, the platform was a secret hit—and bigger than Hinge, its closest rival. Even more bewildering was how Facebook Dating seems to be slowly catching on among young people, with 1.77 million daily active US users between ages 18 and 29, a stat that challenges the idea that only boomers use Facebook. According to a Pew survey from last year, 32 percent of teen respondents said they use Facebook compared to 71 percent in 2015, though Facebook Dating notes that daily conversations among its 18-to-29 demographic increased by 24 percent in 2024. Facebook Dating is not like any other dating app on the market. It’s technically not even an app. Like Marketplace or Groups, it’s a service within the Facebook app. It also doesn’t depend on a subscription model like Bumble or Tinder, a major advantage when onboarding new users. That’s what Olivia Nwokoma, a 24-year-old hospitality worker in Maryland, likes about it the most. “It doesn’t block the better features behind a paywall,” she says. Nwokoma, who is always on the lookout for a good deal on Facebook Marketplace, prefers men over 6 feet, so when a dating app allows for it—and Facebook Dating does—she will often filter by height.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Revenue growth still lopsided with HLS contributing ~94% of incremental revenue sequentially. Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs.

This, the panel said, requires immediate and targeted intervention across all fronts. Judicial capacity must be scaled up with new benches of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), accountability for resolution professionals must be fixed by empowering the panel of creditors and streamlining disciplinary actions, and finality of approved plans must be guaranteed through express legislative amendment, the parliament committee said.

In 2023, she began her career as a content creator and now collaborates with prominent brands such as Dior and Cetaphil. Fang is originally from Taiwan and was raised between Taiwan and Hong Kong, attending international schools before relocating to Canada. In an interview with Allure, she mentioned that she is very close to her mother, whom she describes as “the strongest woman” she knows. She spent her high school years juggling part-time jobs , including working at Brandy Melville and serving as a hostess at Vancouver’s Cactus Club Cafe. During that period, she had a modest following on TikTok, but everything changed when she was unexpectedly called to work at Cactus Club Cafe on a rainy day, according to a report by South China Morning Post.  She started crying and recording her emotional breakdown while doing her makeup on camera. The video went viral, launching her career in content creation. Her relatable personality even earned her a contract with United Talent Agency, the report said. “In 2023, she filmed herself crying while getting ready for yet another long shift, a video that unexpectedly went viral. People came for the relatability but stayed for Fang's makeup tips and unfiltered personality,” Forbes said. Fang, currently an undergraduate at NYU, earned roughly $4 million last year as a beauty influencer. Her classmates likely admire her for securing brand deals with Dior, representing Cetaphil's campaigns, and featuring on billboard ads, Forbes noted. In terms of beauty brand collaborations, she has partnered with brands such as Kosas, Caudalie, Make Up For Ever, OGX Beauty, Mugler, Too Faced Cosmetics, Neutrogena, and T-Mobile, among others.

Trump has previously sought to mediate peace, including a summit with Putin in Alaska in August and meetings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , but so far, no agreement has been reached. A leaked US draft of 28 peace proposals last week raised concerns among Ukrainian and European officials. Critics argued that the proposals largely aligned with Moscow’s key demands, including restrictions on Ukraine’s military and Russia’s control of a fifth of Ukrainian territory. European powers subsequently offered their own counter-proposals. Zelensky emphasized Ukraine’s commitment on social media: “Ukraine approaches all diplomatic efforts with utmost seriousness – we are committed to achieving a real peace and guaranteed security. This is exactly the level of commitment that must be compelled from the Russian side.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed, as per Reuters, that Putin would meet Witkoff and Kushner, but refrained from commenting on Russia’s \"red lines,\" noting that megaphone diplomacy is unhelpful. The envoys were accompanied only by an interpreter. Putin has indicated he is open to discussions but warned that if Ukraine rejects an agreement, Russian forces could advance further. He described the discussions as a preliminary review of proposals rather than a formal agreement.

He said, “We reject the ridiculous statement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, which is yet another attempt to spread anti-India misinformation.” Connecting the timeline of events, Jaiswal clarified that India received Pakistan's request through diplomatic channels well in advance and responded within hours.

Giving Tuesday 2025 is today, 2 December, marking a day for people across the United States and the world to give back to their communities, support local organisations, and help those in need. The Giving Tuesday movement was started in 2012 as a simple idea: a day to encourage people to do good. It has since exploded into a global phenomenon, unleashing the power of radical generosity. The movement has raised billions of dollars for non-profit organisations globally since its inception. In the US alone, participants donated an estimated $3.6 billion in 2024, supporting causes ranging from at-risk youth and the environment to animal shelters and food insecurity. While financial donations are always essential for non-profits to sustain their vital work, there are many meaningful ways to participate in Giving Tuesday that don't involve sending cash. Generosity comes in many forms—of time, skills, goods, and voice. Many organisations, such as women's shelters, community fridges, children's hospitals, and animal shelters, are always accepting tangible, essential items. This can be a great opportunity to declutter before the end of the year and donate gently used clothes, blankets, or books. One of the most valuable gifts you can give is your time and expertise. Look for a social cause or organisation that matters to you and reach out to them directly. Join volunteer programmes at local hospitals, animal shelters, food banks, or community cleanup initiatives. Share Professional Skills (Pro Bono) : Leverage your expertise in fields such as marketing, accounting, programming, law, or healthcare.

The access came hours after large crowds of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters gathered outside Adiala Jail amid mounting rumours about Khan’s health and well-being . Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Dr. Uzma said her brother appeared physically stable but alleged that he is facing severe psychological pressure in custody. “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. He is angry. He said that they are subjecting him to mental torture, and that Asim Munir is responsible for all of this,” she said, referring to Pakistan’s Army Chief. The prolonged ban on family visits had sparked intense speculation on social media, with some supporters questioning whether the 73-year-old PTI founder was alive. Imran Khan has been imprisoned since August 2023 in multiple legal cases. The Punjab government deployed the entire Rawalpindi police force along Adiala Road to prevent PTI demonstrations . Section 144 — banning gatherings of four or more people — remains in force in both Rawalpindi and Islamabad. Officials said an 8-km stretch around the jail was sealed. “An eight-kilometre stretch has been completely sealed… residents are being required to show their ID card,” a Punjab government official told news agency PTI. The PTI welcomed the government’s decision but questioned whether the access would be sustained. “Although today the government allowed Dr Uzma to see her brother in jail, but let’s see whether the government honours its commitment,” the party said. A group of lawyers also protested outside the Islamabad High Court, accusing the government of keeping Khan in isolation. Earlier, Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan demanded that the government provide evidence that his father was alive .  Imran Khan’s sisters have also warned that if any harm comes to him, those responsible “will not be spared ", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/imran-khan-alive-says-sister-uzma-after-jail-visit-claims-he-is-being-tortured-mentally-11764680821254.html", "timestamp": 1764696794.4723127}

María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) told The New York Post in an interview published on Monday (December 1). She warned that the embattled leader may face a “Panama 2.0” scenario as US forces tighten their presence around Venezuela. According to Salazar, the Trump administration is offering the Venezuelan ruler Maduro one final chance to exit peacefully before considering stronger measures. Salazar argued Maduro lost the 2024 election overwhelmingly, claiming: “Maduro promised President Biden he would leave if he lost the election — and he lost 80-20.” But, she added: “Communists and Marxists lie until they see a bigger force in front of them. Then they run.” The Florida congresswoman told the news outlet that Maduro fears retaliation from Cuban military operatives in Venezuela : “He’s afraid the Cuban military personnel — more than 30,000 on Venezuelan soil — will kill him if he tries to leave. And he knows the Americans will take him out if he doesn’t go.” Salazar praised Trump as the only president in decades willing to take decisive action. “The right thing is exactly what we’re doing: invite him to leave, or take him out, just like we did in Panama,” she said, calling the current situation “Panama No. 2.” She argued there is precedent for removing hostile foreign leaders when US national security is at stake: “We’ve done this before — in Panama, in Libya — under presidents of both parties.” Calling Maduro not only a political threat but a criminal one, Salazar told The New York Post: “He’s the head of the Cartel of the Suns. He was indicted in 2020 for drug trafficking. He stole the election after promising free and fair elections.” She accused the regime of using submarines and other covert methods to ship narcotics into the United States: “He’s flooding the United States with drugs — sometimes even using submarines.” With an estimated 15,000", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/usvenezuela-tensions-rep-salazar-warns-of-panama-2-0-says-trump-ready-to-take-maduro-out-11764679361683.html", "timestamp": 1764696795.0850947}

Uzma Khanum was taken into the prison to meet Khan, while dozens of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters who had come with her waited outside the facility. Uzma's meeting took place while the PTI organised protests outside the Islamabad High Court and Adiala jail, flagging restrictions on Imran Khan’s visitation rights. The party asserted that his family members and senior leaders had been prevented from visiting him. Since October 27, nobody has been allowed to meet the PTI founder or his wife, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi told the news portal. Imran Khan’s family and PTI leaders have been trying to meet him for over three weeks, but their requests have reportedly been ignored. This has led to increasing speculation that the former cricketer and politician might have passed away. However, Adiala jail denied rumours and said, “He is fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention,” Geo News reported. Khan has been jailed since August 2023 and faces multiple charges, including corruption and terrorism, following his removal from power via the opposition's no-trust motion in April 2022.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister and PTI leader Sohail Afridi announced a major protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and a demonstration outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on Tuesday. The KP CM also called on all PTI members to immediately mobilize to Islamabad and later gather near Adiala Jail. Furthermore, all PTI parliamentarians plan to stage a protest at the IHC before the chief justice on Tuesday. “This is blatant contempt of court. We will hold a protest at the IHC,” Afridi said. In anticipation of these large-scale gatherings, authorities moved to restrict public assembly. Section 144, which bans public gatherings, was imposed across Islamabad and Rawalpindi. This comes despite existing restrictions on public assembly that have been in place since 18 November. The Rawalpindi deputy commissioner’s office confirmed the imposition of Section 144 from 1 December to 3 December. A central point of contention is Khan's alleged isolation. PTI leader Sohail Afridi claimed that Imran Khan has been held in \"complete isolation\" since 4 November.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju said the government was willing to discuss any issue and had invited leaders from various parties for a dialogue, but asserted that the proceedings cannot be disrupted over a single demand. One issue cannot outweigh others at a time when members of smaller parties also want to discuss matters important to them, he said amid slogan shouting by Opposition MPs demanding a debate on the SIR of the voters' list in nine states and three Union Territories. \"Two to four parties are disrupting the House... In a democracy, people win and lose. They should not vent their anger like this... By doing this, you are losing the trust of the people,\" Rijiju said, as reported by PTI. The minister told the protesting members that they should protect the decorum of the House and that there are many members from smaller parties who should also be heard. \"Disruption of the proceedings by members of a few parties is not right, and also anger of losing elections should not be shown in the House,\" the minister said, adding that even late BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had lost elections. Meanwhile, Lok Sabha proceedings adjourned for the day following vociferous protests by Opposition members over the SIR. Taking a jibe at the Congress on its recent electoral losses, Rijiju said the party is losing the confidence of the people.

In a post on X, the Tesla CEO predicted that there will be a war soon, maybe in a matter of a few years. “War is inevitable. 5 years, 10 at most,” Elon Musk wrote, without providing any further explanation. Elon Musk was replying to a post that discussed the effect of nuclear deterrence on global governance. “Possibly my bleakest take (that I hope is wrong) is that governments all suck now because nuclear weapons prevent war, or even the credible threat of war, between major powers. So there’s no external/evolutionary/market pressure on governments to not suck,” the user, who identifies himself as Hunter Ash, wrote on X. Because Musk did not provide an explanation to his war predictions , users on X were naturally shocked and looked for answers. “That is very pessimistic. You are usually the big optimist on this platform. Now I’m sad,” one user wrote. Another confused user asked AI assistant Grok about when and why this war would start. “Elon didn't specify parties or reasons in that post. From his past statements, he's warned of potential civil wars in Europe/UK due to mass migration and identity politics, or global conflicts like US-China over Taiwan, or Ukraine escalation to WW3, citing rising tensions despite nuclear deterrents. This aligns with the thread's governance discussion,” Grok replied. “Would these be regional neighbor wars such as what we have seen in Ukraine and Palestine. Not a far stretch from civil?” another user asked. “What? Eek? but let's not hide our heads in the sand,” a netizen said. In August 2024, Elon Musk had made a similar war prediction. At that time, anti-immigration riots were engulfing towns and cities in the United Kingdom, and the tech billionaire was among the social media users who played a big role in the conflict.

Here’s why tensions are escalating across Pakistan.", "content": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has announced a major wave of demonstrations in Islamabad and Rawalpindi on Tuesday, protesting what it alleges are unlawful restrictions on access to former Prime Minister Imran Khan inside Adiala Jail. PTI leaders say they have been repeatedly denied permission to meet their incarcerated founding chairman, prompting the party to organise demonstrations outside both Adiala Jail and the Islamabad High Court (IHC). According to Dawn , the plan was finalised despite the authorities enforcing fresh curbs on public assembly. PTI leader Asad Qaiser told the publication that lawmakers from both houses of parliament would begin their protest outside the IHC before moving towards the jail. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” Qaiser said. Qaiser added that he would address a public gathering in Quetta on Tuesday, while advocate Gohar Ali Khan and other senior PTI figures would lead demonstrations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The PTI protests will unfold under a sweeping ban on public gatherings, implemented by both local and federal Pakistani authorities. The Rawalpindi district administration issued a three-day ban, effective Monday, while Islamabad’s administration imposed a two-month prohibition starting from 18 November. The move has been criticised by PTI as an attempt to suppress political opposition and prevent supporters from drawing attention to what they describe as a violation of Imran Khan’s fundamental rights. PTI maintains that Imran Khan’s family members and senior party leaders have been denied access to him for several weeks. The party alleges this amounts to a serious violation of both human rights and judicial orders. Qaiser claimed that a parliamentary committee has also demanded Khan’s release, arguing that the administration is “committing a human rights violation by stopping the former prime mi", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/imran-khan-row-erupts-pti-launches-major-protests-as-sec-144-curfew-hits-islamabad-rawalpindi-11764662024095.html", "timestamp": 1764696797.5217001}

The stay order brings proceedings in the trial court to a halt while the apex court examines procedural concerns raised by the senior leader. The Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi passed the order after hearing Yediyurappa's petition challenging the Karnataka High Court's refusal to quash the case, the Bar and Bench report added. The bench also issued a notice to the Karnataka government, seeking its response to Yediyurappa’s plea. The limited question before the Court is whether he is entitled to have his petition heard on merits by the High Court—an issue Yediyurappa’s legal team argues was incorrectly foreclosed during earlier proceedings. In its order, the Supreme Court observed: “The coordinate bench has misconstrued the previous decision dated so and so while holding that in light of the decision in the previous round, the petition cannot be heard on merits. Hence, we issue notice for the limited purpose as to decide afresh in light of liberty granted to the petitioner, wide order date Feb 7, 2025.” Senior Advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Yediyurappa, earlier argued that the High Court had ignored key evidence. \"There are certain statements which prosecution suppresses. High Court has ignored facts that there are people present saying nothing as such happened. He has been four times Chief Minister,\" the senior counsel said. Bar and Bench quoted CJI Kant saying, \"How can you compel High Court to hold a mini trial?\" The matter will now return to the Karnataka High Court for reconsideration on the narrow question of whether Yediyurappa is entitled to a full hearing on the merits of his challenge.

Notably, the clarification comes amid Opposition MPs voicing their strong protest against the compulsory installation of this app on smartphones. The backlash began after the Department of Telecom (DoT) directed phone manufacturers and importers to ensure that its Sanchar Saathi app, designed to detect fraud, is pre-installed in all new devices within 90 days. Notably, Reuters cited sources to report that US tech giant Apple plans not to comply with the mandate and will convey the same to New Delhi. Speaking to reporters on 2 December, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused the government of dictatorship and infringing on the right to privacy of citizens, calling Sanchar Saathi a “snooping app”. The party has demanded that the government immediately roll back the app. “The Sanchar Saathi is a snooping app, and clearly it is ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family and friends without the government looking at everything,” she said, accusing the Centre of turning the country into a “dictatorship”. “It's not just snooping on the telephone.

His Knight of the Grand Cross of the Royal Victoria Order has also been annulled. This latest step follows a series of actions against the disgraced royal. Andrew lost his “prince” title and was forced out of his Royal Lodge home in October. King Charles’ action came after continued backlash over Andrew’s links to Jeffrey Epstein . The removal of Andrew’s remaining titles now includes Prince along with Duke of York, Earl of Inverness, Baron Killyleagh and His Royal Highness. According to Buckingham Palace, Charles started a formal process to strip Andrew of all remaining titles and honours. The Palace also stated that Andrew’s long lease at Royal Lodge had given him legal cover to stay there. But, he needs to shift to a private accommodation chosen by the monarchy. “THE KING has directed that the appointment of Andrew Albert Christian Edward MOUNTBATTEN-WINDSOR to be a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, dated 23 April 2006, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order,” says the formal statement. “These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” Buckingham Palace told Page Six. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse,” the statement added. Andrew is expected to vacate the Royal Lodge soon. He will shift to accommodation on the private Sandringham estate. Sarah Ferguson has lived at the property since 2008.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge.
