IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates. The SLST-2 examination was conducted by the state SSC in September, 2025 in the wake of the Supreme Court previously scrapping the entire 2016 teachers recruitment panel on grounds of large scale corruption. Following the publication of the written test results and follow-up interview calls for shortlisted candidates for recruitment to classes 11-12 in state-run and -aided schools earlier this month, large scale protests were held by fresh candidates who took to the streets alleging the SSC’s granting of ‘experience marks’ to the now out-of-job untainted 2016 candidates was “unfair” and thwarted their qualification chances for the next stage. The SSC is yet to publish the results for the tests of teachers’ recruitment to classes 9-10, where it is likely to follow the same marking pattern.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options.

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category. It sought a direction to the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education and School Federation of India Games to schedule the annual sports calendar (including all zonal, inter-zonal, state, and national tournaments, trials and coaching camps) for all outdoor sports in the capital during safer and less susceptible months with verifiably better ambient air quality. The petitioners said at the time of filing the plea, the city was under the Grade Response Action Plan-III (GRAP-III) emergency plan and risked escalation to GRAP-IV.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764069248.7966878}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

The livestock sector contributes about 3.89 per cent to the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and nearly 20.34 per cent to its agricultural GDP. JIS College of Veterinary & Animal Sciences (JISCOVAS) has been constructed on a 30-acre campus in Mogra in Hooghly district. The formal announcement was made by the group Managing Director Sardar Taranjit Singh. Affiliated to the West Bengal University of Animal & Fishery Sciences (WBUAFS) and recognised by the Veterinary Council of India (VCI), the institution will offer the five-and-a-half-year Bachelor of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry (B.V.Sc. & A.H.) programme. This includes a compulsory one-year internship. The annual intake capacity has been fixed at 80 students. Admissions will require NEET UG qualification, along with 50 per cent marks in physics, chemistry, biology and English at the 10+2 level for general category candidates.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1764069319.620884}

It offers students, parents and teachers a single platform for all school-related services. Speaking at the launch, Education Minister Ashish Sood said the initiative aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India and Viksit Bharat 2047. The app, he said, would simplify time management and the learning process for students while reducing teachers’ administrative workload, thereby improving the overall quality of education. Through the app, key information such as timetables, homework, notes, attendance and results will be available remotely. The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated. Sood said the digital platform would promote innovation and entrepreneurial thinking among students by making information easily accessible. “Now, time will not be wasted in searching for information. Instead, information will reach the students directly. This is the true essence of digital empowerment,” he said. The minister added that the app is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and will encourage skill-based learning while integrating activities under the Fit India initiative.

The initiative aims to promote sustainable growth in international education, attract more overseas students, maintain education standards, and manage immigration risks effectively. From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit. At present, there are 40,987 student visa holders with in-study work rights. Of these, 29,790 visas will expire on or before March 31, 2026, and 11,197 after that date.

The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday — more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020 . It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery. Companies from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China.

The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless ” and pocket-sized . Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io , to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco. Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after. However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions. “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes. “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said.

The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding.

Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko , is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “ An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own .” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox , I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.

AWS announced Monday it is investing $50 billion to build AI “high-performance computing infrastructure” purposefully built for the U.S. government. The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services. The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company. AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government. The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification. Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year. OpenAI launched a version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies in January.

It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October. As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas), and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80% on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark. Anthropic also emphasized Opus’ computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team, and Enterprise users. Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. “There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.” Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.

The new fundraise comes less than a year after it expanded its Series C from $500 million to $700 million, bringing the total raised in the last year or so to $1.4 billion, a sizable amount even in the heady world of nuclear power startups. X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date. X-energy said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica. The new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures. X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity. Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led the first installment of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy more than 600 megawatts of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon’s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039.

Reuters first reported this weekend that DOGE had broken up, ending the months-long effort by Musk and his associates — many recruited from his various private-sector companies — to reduce alleged fraud and waste and cut employees across the federal government. DOGE was created by an executive order signed by President Trump in January. The initiative was expected to run for close to two years. As of early November, DOGE “doesn’t exist,” according to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources department. In a tweet on Sunday, Kupor said that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.” Amy Gleason, who was named as the “official” acting administrator of DOGE earlier this year, posted on LinkedIn soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.” While active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. DOGE’s cuts have also been blamed for countless deaths across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.

The feature, which allows users to post under a custom username instead of their real name, provides an alternative to posting anonymously. With anonymous posting, users can share without the post being connected to their Facebook profile and real-life identity, but this approach also doesn’t allow other group members to get to know them or their personality, or to follow their updates over time. Meta says that nicknames will allow people to participate in groups more personally while maintaining privacy, particularly in groups where users want privacy but still want to build a recognizable presence. It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s long-standing “real name” policy, which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life. That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections. After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature. This allows users to hide their main profile and profile photo from other members but not from group admins, moderators, or Facebook’s own systems.

For creators, this often means there is pressure to create more content than ever before to be relevant and make a living out of it, especially as more AI-generated slop is infiltrating these platforms. Jay Neo, a creator and former content lead for short videos at MrBeast, thinks AI can help creators understand what is working for them and also help them create new content ideas in that direction. That’s why, along with former Palantir engineer Shivam Kumar and creator Harry Jones, they are building a platform called Palo to aid creators. Neo joined MrBeast at 18 to work on viewer retention. In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped. “I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said. Neo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to get a baguette , which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format. In 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month.

Stay with me — it’s not entirely far-fetched. Thanks to advances in AI, computing, and superconducting magnets , fusion power is closer than ever to commercial reality. It’s increasingly looking like fusion is more a question of “when” not “if.” And when it does happen, it promises to deliver large amounts of clean power from a plentiful fuel source — water. Putting a reactor on a ship isn’t necessarily unreasonable, either. Today, submarines and aircraft carriers powered by nuclear fission reactors routinely prowl the seas. They’re quiet, powerful, and can operate for decades before they need refueling. The civilian sector even toyed with the idea of nuclear-powered cargo ships back in the 1960s and 1970s. “Fission has definitely paved the way in terms of nuclear power on ships,” Cohen, who co-founded Maritime Fusion , told TechCrunch. Fusion promises to give ships similar capabilities but without concerns over meltdowns, proliferation, or radiation. For now, the sector has been focused on building the first reactors on land. “I’m pretty sure we’re the first people to ever really look at what is it like to put a tokamak on a ship,” Cohen said, referring to a leading fusion reactor design. If fusion does pan out, then Maritime’s leap to the seas would put it ahead of the curve. Plus, Cohen argues, it might actually be easier from a business perspective to start out at sea. The first fusion power plants won’t be cheap, and it will take some time before they come down in cost. “Competing against things like solar and wind on the grid is super challenging from a cost perspective,” Cohen said. At sea, the economics look different.

Revolut did not mention how much it raised in the share sale, but it did say it allowed employees to cash out in the deal. As of August 2025, the company had a post-money valuation of $48 billion, and has raised a total of $2.89 billion in venture capital, according to PitchBook . Founded in 2015, Revolut offers a range of services spanning multi-currency accounts, payment and transfer services, crypto products, insurance, and more. The new funding comes as the neobank has been pouring truckloads of cash into expanding its operations internationally. Besides the U.K., where the company is awaiting a final nod to operate as a full-fledged bank , Revolut has a banking license in the European Union, and it operates in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, and the U.S. It launched operations in India in October, is about to start operating in Colombia in 2026, and has received a banking license in Mexico. It also has plans to launch in Argentina, wants to enter Africa (first with South Africa), and has an in-principal payments license in the UAE. The company’s been doing well financially, too: In 2024, its revenue rose 72% to $4 billion, and it claims it reached $1 billion in annualized revenue this year. Per its last annual report , Revolut reported net profit of $1 billion (£790 million) in 2024. The company also launched a crypto exchange, Revolut X, part of its Wealth division, which saw revenue rise 298% to $647 million in 2024 from just $158 million in 2023. The company has grand ambitions , aiming to reach 100 million customers by mid-2027, and en", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/revolut-hits-75b-valuation-in-new-capital-raise/", "timestamp": 1764069603.1501215}

It simply read, “gm”—internet slang for “good morning.” The account has been posting consistently since. Bankman-Fried—known widely as SBF—is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence in California. In November 2023, he was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy by a jury in the Southern District of New York over his role in the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Immediately after his sentencing, Bankman-Fried signaled his intention to appeal . In spring, he spoke to a handful of reporters from prison. But otherwise, he has largely receded from public view. Distracted by the arrival of US bitcoin exchange-traded funds , a memecoin goldrush , talk of national bitcoin reserves , and the prospect of an easy ride under US president Donald Trump, the crypto industry moved on too. However, since September, Bankman-Fried’s X account has been causing a stir . (Though Bankman-Fried does not have access to the internet in prison, a friend is supposedly posting on his behalf .) The posts lob criticism at the administrators of the FTX bankruptcy estate and focus on alleged misconceptions about the condition of FTX’s finances when it fell; they claim that the money was never missing, only stuck in illiquid assets. From prison, Bankman-Fried has also been sitting for interviews with media outlet Mother Jones, published in October, during which he largely promoted the same perspective. His mother, the legal professor Barbara Fried, recently launched a Substack . Her first and only post, published in late October, is a 65-page treatise entitled “The Trial of Sam Bankman-Fried,” in which she makes the case that her son neither committed a fraud nor received a fair trial.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool. From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works.

The console you spent countless hours huddled around as a kid is now old enough to be crippled by student debt and burdened with existential despair, just like you! If that reminder of the cruel and ceaseless march of time makes you want to retreat into a nostalgic bubble when life was easier and, say, play some N64 games, unfortunately, that's been pretty tricky in recent years. Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly due to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs in terms of connectivity or resolution. Analogue 3D Rating: 9/10 Enter, then, the Analogue3D, the latest console from the makers of the Analogue Pocket . Like its portable predecessor, this is a field programmable gate array ( FPGA ) piece of kit that perfectly mimics the original console, allowing you to play authentic game carts without emulation. It goes beyond being a third-party remake though—it runs those games better than ever thanks to a baked-in virtualized Expansion Pak and the ability to overclock, beautifully presenting games with a host of display options, and outputting it all in glorious 4K. Throw in universal support for N64 carts and accessories from anywhere in the world, meaning the region lockouts of the '90s are literally a thing of the past, and this might just be my favorite \"new\" console of 2025.

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet cofounded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him. Nnormal Backcountry Nnormal Nnormal's aim is to institute sustainable practices into manufacturing gear. “Probably the most important system is the most complicated,” Jornet said. “It's very costly to be constantly rotating things … how can we have [a company] that's not based on overconsumption?” The solution was to create incredibly durable running shoes that only have to be swapped out every two to four years.

As soon as I got my hands on a joystick and mashed a few buttons, I was hooked. While home arcade machines will never compete with a fully fledged arcade, good arcades are few and far between nowadays, unless you can manage a trip to Tokyo . You could snag one of the best retro game consoles for under the TV, but there’s something special about the controls and the artwork of a home arcade machine, and they give you a chance to play classic games with your family and friends the way the designers intended. Updated November 2025: We added the G'AIM'E Time Crisis Premium Light Gun, dimensions for each cabinet, and updated prices. Are Home Arcade Machines Worth It? Most home arcade machines are at least as expensive as the latest game consoles, sometimes far more expensive. They usually come with several games included, but they are still a considerable investment, so think carefully before you buy. Don’t get hung up on how many titles are included. It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal.

This means that security teams at tech companies have more code than ever to review while dealing with even more pressure from bad actors. On Monday, Amazon will publish details for the first time of an internal system known as Autonomous Threat Analysis (ATA), which the company has been using to help its security teams proactively identify weaknesses in its platforms, perform variant analysis to quickly search for other, similar flaws, and then develop remediations and detection capabilities to plug holes before attackers find them. ATA was born out of an internal Amazon hackathon in August 2024, and security team members say that it has grown into a crucial tool since then. The key concept underlying ATA is that it isn't a single AI agent developed to comprehensively conduct security testing and threat analysis. Instead, Amazon developed multiple specialized AI agents that compete against each other in two teams to rapidly investigate real attack techniques and different ways they could be used against Amazon's systems—and then propose security controls for human review. “The initial concept was aimed to address a critical limitation in security testing—limited coverage and the challenge of keeping detection capabilities current in a rapidly evolving threat landscape,\" Steve Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, tells WIRED. “Limited coverage means you can’t get through all of the software or you can’t get to all of the applications because you just don’t have enough humans. And then it’s great to do an analysis of a set of software, but if you don’t keep the detection systems themselves up to date with the changes in the threat landscape, you’re missing half of the picture.” As part of scaling its use of ATA, Amazon developed special “high-fidelity” testing environments that are deeply real", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-autonomous-threat-analysis/", "timestamp": 1764069606.737545}

There could also be major reconsiderations of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. Not to mention the Digital Networks Act and the EU Space Act, before they even see the light of day, are already the subject of legal disputes. Since the tariff agreement between the United States and Europe was signed last August, big tech companies, backed by the Trump administration, have increased pressure to soften restrictions on all fronts. Europe's landmark artificial intelligence law went into effect in August 2024, but the deadline for full implementation is set for August 2027, with an important intermediate milestone in 2026. According to the Financial Times, the first review of possible amendments could take place toward the end of 2026 as part of a broader Digital Omnibus package, which aims to simplify guidelines. At a daily press briefing on November 7, Thomas Regnier, the spokesman for the European Commission for Digital Sovereignty, acknowledged mounting concerns. “A lot is happening in the field of artificial intelligence. Standards are lagging. There are concerns from industry and member states,\" he said. “In this context, we have a ‘digital omnibus’ coming, and that would be the appropriate framework to address some of these concerns. But no decision has been made yet.” The most significant change would involve postponing by one year—from August 2026 to August 2027—the application of penalties for violations of the new rules in order to “grant sufficient time for providers and users of AI systems to comply.” The Digital Networks Act had been promised by the end of t", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/europe-bends-us-digital-policies-eu-ai-act/", "timestamp": 1764069608.4163802}

It's comprised of a ring of magnets on the back of the phone, and it was developed to create a faster, more precise wireless charging system. However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets. If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone.

It’s probably no surprise they're all OLEDs , which not only control each tiny point of light at the pixel level, but have also gotten brighter and better in each of the last few years. What might surprise you if you haven’t shopped TVs in a while is that Panasonic now joins the usual suspects from Samsung, Sony, and LG with its new flagship, the Z95B. It’s a doozy. As with last year’s Z95A that marked Panasonic’s impressive US return , the Z95B provides near-flawless performance, from perfect black levels to pristine detail and colors. It’s brighter and more striking, thanks to skillful deployment of the same breakthrough RGB tandem panel used in the stunning LG G5 , and its built-in sound is easily the best I’ve heard from any TV all year. The biggest downside is that its premium performance is again paired with a budget smart interface; Panasonic’s version of Fire TV is awkwardly laid out and flooded with Amazon ads, right down to the remote. But for well-heeled buyers who'd rather sub in a streaming device over a soundbar or speakers , the Z95B is one of the best TVs I've laid eyes (or ears) on. Setting up the Z95B’s hardware is joyously simple once you pry it loose from its jigsaw of foam and cardboard. The industrial-strength swivel stand comes in one piece and attaches in seconds, keeping the 65-inch model I tested stable and accessible with four small screws. The TV looks the part of a premium flagship, with thin bezels and fabric-wrapped acoustic accents. Panasonic Z95B OLED TV Rating: 9/10 The circular base is slim enough to support an add-on soundbar, but this TV functions best as an all-in-one. One reason is the HDMI selection, which includes just two ports with HDMI 2.1 support for features like ALLM and VRR at up to 144 Hz, one of which is the eARC/ARC port where a soundbar or speaker system would connect.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war. Aaron Roth suspects that the pitfalls of algorithmic pricing may not have a simple sol", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/game-theory-explains-how-algorithms-can-drive-up-prices/", "timestamp": 1764069609.799315}

But what if you want to bring the full excitement of the movies home? How can you ensure you’re getting an audio performance that will do justice to the pictures you’re watching? By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need. Below you'll find everything you need to know about getting started with surround sound, and the kind of setup you will need in order to achieve it. Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup. You may have seen surround sound setups described numerically—most commonly as 5.1-channel or 7.1-channel surround sound systems, but so", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-perfect-surround-sound-speaker-setup/", "timestamp": 1764069609.9802308}

Like the proverbial dog to man, a chef needs their knife. Arguably the most important multipurpose tool you can find in a kitchen, it's the chef's main weapon—it can slice, dice, and chop ingredients with speed and precision. A chef's knife generally has a super-sharp end point and a curved, sloping edge. This curve is what makes the chef knife stand out, as it's designed to work with the natural rocking motion for quick chopping that also allows for finer cuts. With technology like ovens with cameras inside and AI-enabled refrigerators , the chef's knife remains the simple tool necessary for any kitchen. However, not every chef's knife is created equal—the best chef's knife varies by what's best for the individual person, including factors like comfort level while wielding kitchen tools, the size of your hands (it even varies if you're a lefty or righty), and what type of food you're cooking. The basic 6- to 8-inch chef knife works best for most people, especially for beginners. It's the most versatile knife, able to slice meat, dice dense veggies, and smash and mince garlic. Chef's knives can range from the price of a specialty latte to hundreds of dollars. We've sliced and diced for in our kitchens for hours to find a range of chef's knives that will work best for nearly every type of cook, and we've found that the Hedley & Bennett Chef's Knife for $120 is best for most people, with the Shun Premier Blonde 6-Inch Chef's Knife for $200 as our favorite Japanese knife.

I have made cold-brew slushie lattes, mimosa slushies, frosé slushies, daiquiri and margarita slushies, sour-beer slushies, Mike's Hard Mango Lemonade Slushies, and of course slushies made with fruit juice and simple syrup for parties full of children. All things cold and sweet are delicious. The Ninja Slushi was discounted to $300 as recently as October. At the time, this was the lowest I expected to see the price fall this year. Glad to be wrong, I guess. (But note that the smaller, Walmart-exclusive, 72-ounce Ninja Slushi machine is on sale for $250 , a price it's seen multiple times since last year.)

If you knew an intercontinental ballistic missile was heading somewhere in middle America, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead, you'd probably hope that the US government and military would be on top of the situation. At the very least, you'd expect them to know who launched the strike, from where, and how to intercept it. In A House of Dynamite , the most terrifying thing is how much might not be known in such a nightmarish scenario, and how the very systems we think will protect us from nuclear war might not be up to the job. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow ( The Hurt Locker ) and featuring a powerhouse cast including Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Tracy Letts, and Anthony Ramos, this triptych explores the same nightmarish 18 minutes after an unidentified missile is detected from three different perspectives, each chapter likely filling you with mounting existential dread.

It’s not because of my health, or because I dislike the taste of chicken or beef: It’s a lifestyle choice I made because I wanted to reduce my impact on the planet. And yet, twice a day, every day, I lovingly scoop a cup of meat-based kibble into a bowl and set it down for my 50-pound rescue dog, a husky mix named Loki. Until recently, I hadn’t devoted a huge amount of thought to that paradox. Then I read an article in the Associated Press headlined “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The study , led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.” The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions. But mere hours after the AP published its article, its aim had been recast as something else entirely: an attack on people’s furry family members. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one Reddit user wrote. Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals.

It doesn’t use electricity, yet experts agree that it can brew a richer and more full-bodied cup of joe than its more technologically advanced peers . For example, natural oils that would otherwise be filtered out in a drip coffee maker remain fully intact, making the coffee aromatic and robust. The French press method of making coffee is straightforward, cost-effective, easy to do, and hard to mess up. The device also doesn’t take up too much counter space, especially if you're using our top pick, the Espro P3 ($40) . Once you have your measurements down, it’s a quick process of steeping coarse coffee grounds in near-boiling water. We tested these models using the James Hoffmann French press technique , in which he uses 30 grams of coffee to 500 grams of water, waits for four minutes, and stirs through the crust. Whether you choose a French press made from glass or stainless steel, a few factors make a difference based on your personal coffee needs. Want to make the process even easier?

The filters are in the shape of a basket with a solid plastic bottom and fine mesh walls.

Vaping is a major problem in US high schools. But is the solution to spy on students in the bathroom? An investigation by The 74, copublished with WIRED, found that schools around the country are turning to vape detectors in an effort to crack down on nicotine and cannabis consumption on school grounds. Some of the vape detectors go far beyond detecting vapor by including microphones that are surprisingly accurate and revealing.

Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big-screen television. The benefits include fixed specifications, meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers know that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course).

He hands over his ID while bystander players yell at the agents and demand his release. “Why are you harassing people?” one says, before the worker is finally let go. Later in SteveTheGamer55’s play session, he stands in front of a large iron gate reminiscent of those in ICE detention centers seen in cities like Chicago. More in-game ICE agents have gathered. He records from his phone. Just in front of him, a player in a red suit demands to see a warrant for his client. The “special event” held on November 20, where players took on different roles that reflect real-life ICE raids, was the first initiative by New Save Collective , a baker’s dozen of gamers with backgrounds in activism and organizing, whose goal is to educate gamers and teach people about their rights when dealing with ICE in real-world situations. On November 21, at 7:30 pm ET, gamers will gather in Epic’s massively popular battle royale, Fortnite , to hold a closed scavenger hunt that will serve as a more casual educational opportunity. The group is working with several immigration advocacy groups, as well as collaborating with content creators, to spread their message online. Online gaming spaces have long appealed to the right as a place to push conservative or even extremist ideologies . The US military has been open about its attempts to use games as a recruitment tool , and immigration authorities are no different.

After 11 days, the company began contacting those who made purchases, calling it a “clear mistake.”", "content": "On November 8, an offer for loyalty card holders appeared on the website of MediaWorld, a European electronics retailer. The deal: an iPad Air for 15 euros (about $17) instead of the usual €879 (about $1,012). No catch, no strings attached. The proximity to Black Friday only made the offer more plausible. And so several consumers immediately purchased the product by choosing the “payment and pickup in store” opetion, on paper the safest to avoid unexpected problems. The process was seamless, even for those ordering online. According to the accounts of some users on Reddit, their order was accepted, and after about 40 minutes they received an email confirming the availability of the product. In the store, the €15 payment went through successfully and MediaWorld delivered the iPads as expected. The terms and conditions attached to the order make no mention of any clause regarding pricing errors or the possibility for the company to request subsequent additions. Eleven days later, however, MediaWorld sent a simple email—not a formal communication via certified mail—stating that the published price was “clearly incorrect.” The company then asked affected customers to choose between two solutions: Keep the iPad and pay the difference to match the price, but with a €150 discount, or return it and receive a refund of the €15 and a €20 discount voucher for their inconvenience. Following the incident, WIRED contacted MediaWorld for comment. “We confirm that, in a very short period of time, due to a clearly recognizable technical error caused by an extraordinary and unexpected glitch on our ecommerce platform, some products were mistakenly displayed at prices that, due to their clear and objective disconnect from the true market value and the correct promotional price, should never have been displayed. This was a manifest error, making it economically unsustainable and not representative of our commercial offering,” a MediaWorld spokesperson explains.

Franchises finalized their retained and released player lists by November 15, leaving a total purse of 237.55 crore rupees to bid for the remaining 77 squad slots. Franchises have released marquee names heading into the auction like Russell, De Kock and Maxwell. The Jamaican all-rounder was released by Kolkata Knight Riders after years of dominance. He was released with a price tag of INR 12 crore. Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals, and Punjab Kings eyeing his explosive hitting and death bowling credentials. Russell remains a tournament staple for teams seeking finisher expertise. Kolkata Knight Riders unexpectedly parted with their prized opener after retaining him for INR 23.75 crore just last year.

What can we all learn from it? Here’s the meaning behind his words, his enduring legacy, and why courage shapes our lives.​", "content": "“He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.” ​ Ali’s quote teaches that progress requires boldness. If you always play it safe, you will never achieve greatness. Accepting challenges and taking smart chances is vital for success, whether in sports, life or personal growth. Muhammad Ali was an American boxer who won the world heavyweight title three times and became Olympic gold medalist in 1960. He was known for his fast footwork, powerful punches, sharp wit, and for standing up for his beliefs outside the ring. His legacy endures in both sports and civil rights history. Risk means stepping outside your comfort zone, confronting fear, and facing the chance of failure. It is not about recklessness but calculated, thoughtful action even when uncertain. Courage is choosing to act despite the possibility of setback. Ali refused to be ordinary. He fought top opponents, challenged unfair systems, and spoke his truth even when unpopular. Every major win—from his first title bout to his social activism—came from taking risks no one else dared. Achieving anything remarkable—whether running a marathon or changing a habit—demands going beyond comfort. Mentally, facing new challenges builds resilience, a vital trait for your brain’s growth and for stress control. Taking risks is healthy for your mind, if done thoughtfully. Ali’s message isn’t just for champions. It is for students, parents, professionals, anyone longing for meaning. Embracing new experiences, tackling fears, and learning from failures help you achieve extraordinary things—no matter where you begin.

Ten Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives struck simultaneously across Mumbai, killing 166 civilians and soldiers. The siege lasted 60 hours. According to BBC, it exposed vulnerabilities in urban defense and changed how India approached internal security forever. Per media reports, the ten gunmen were trained by Lashkar-e-Taiba in Karachi. They crossed the Arabian Sea by boat from Pakistan, hijacking the fishing vessel Kuber en route. David Headley, an American scout, coordinated reconnaissance for months. Ajmal Kasab emerged as the sole survivor, later confessing under interrogation. According to BBC reports, gunmen struck twelve locations. Primary targets: Central Railway Station (52 dead), Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Oberoi Trident Hotel, Nariman House Jewish center, hospitals, cafes. The coordinated strikes lasted exactly 60 hours, ending November 29 morning. According to BBC, around 31 guests and staff died in a four-day siege starting November 26. Gunmen entered the iconic hotel lobby near Gateway of India, unleashing automatic fire and grenades. Multiple floors were set ablaze. The standoff captivated world media as commandos attempted rescue operations under fire. Per CNN, approximately 30 individuals were killed during a three-day siege at the Oberoi luxury hotel. The attack began around 10 PM with gunfire in corridors and public areas. Guests huddled under tables. Media reports notes that the siege unfolded across multiple floors before security forces contained and neutralized the threat methodically. According to Times of India archives, the historic CST station was targeted with heavy gunfire and grenades during evening rush hours. Over 60 people died in corridors and platforms. Britannica reports that attackers fired indiscriminately into crowds. The station, handling lakhs of daily commuters, became a battlefield in minutes.

Yet we weren't a sovereign republic yet. We needed rules, a framework, a governing skeleton. On November 26, 1949, India's Constituent Assembly adopted its Constitution after nearly three years of intricate drafting. Today, this historic document—and the visionary leadership of Ambedkar's committee—remains the bedrock of the world's largest democracy, uniting a bewilderingly diverse nation under one legal framework. In 1946, India elected 389 members to draft its Constitution. This Assembly wasn't a foreign import; it was elected by Indian representatives to reflect India's will. Dr. Rajendra Prasad chaired; the real intellectual firepower lay elsewhere, waiting to be unleashed. The Assembly appointed a seven-member Drafting Committee. Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar became Chairman. Other stalwarts: Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, K.M. Munshi, N. Gopalaswami, Muhammed Saadulla, and two others who'd later be replaced due to illness and death—testament to the grueling work ahead. For seven months, Ambedkar's committee labored. On February 21, 1948, they unveiled the first draft: 395 articles, 8 schedules, 22 parts. It wasn't perfect; it was scrutinized, torn apart, rebuilt. The drafting phase itself took 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days—a grueling odyssey by any standard. From November 14 to 26, the Assembly conducted three exhaustive readings of the final draft. Members debated provisions on caste, religion, language, federalism. Ambedkar steered every argument, defending the Constitution's progressive bones against both conservative and radical critiques relentlessly. At last, 284 members signed the adopted Constitution. The Assembly declared it complete. Yet implementation wasn't immediate. A deliberate gap existed, charged with symbolic weight. Ram Manohar Sinha and Nand Lal Bose of Shantiniketan illuminated the original Constitution by hand. It cost 64 lakh rupees (adjusted for inflation).

India had yoga, neem, tulsi, and homemade meals long before these trends emerged; then, what's the real danger? According to Rujuta, food confusion often causes more harm than the food itself. While packaged items like biscuits are eaten without concern, traditional staples like roti are unfairly blamed for inflammation. For generations, roti, rice , and dal have provided balanced nutrition and sustained Indian diets , unlike many modern processed snacks. She explains that roti doesn’t cause inflammation. Instead, factors like packaged atta, refined grains, low activity, and ultra-processed snacks are responsible. Homemade rotis - whether of wheat , jowar , or ragi - are nourishing and gut-friendly. Rice is one of the staple foods of India, and it's not unhealthy, but one of the gentlest foods for the gut. Rujuta reminds us that rice supports digestion, cools the gut and pairs beautifully with dal for complete nutrition and has the same level of protein as meat. She also highlighted that Indian foods are often avoided or feared until they receive Western validation. Many traditional foods were abandoned and only embraced again when labeled as ‘superfoods’ abroad, despite sustaining generations of people for centuries. Indians have not learned wellness from the world; it has taught wellness to the world. Yoga , tulsi,neem,ayurved and seasonal eating. India was already practising it even before it became a global trend; true health begins with respecting what we already have.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

In its post on 25 November, the ministry said that it is ensuring coordination between all aviation authorities, and that operations across India remain smooth. “Following the 23 Nov volcanic eruption in Ethiopia and the eastward movement of the ash cloud, MoCA—along with ATC, IMD, airlines and international aviation agencies—is ensuring seamless coordination,” it stated. The MoCa post added, “AAI has issued the necessary NOTAM and all affected flights have been kept informed. Operations across India remain smooth, with only a few flights rerouted or descended as a precaution. There is no cause for concern at this moment. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will provide timely updates to ensure passenger safety.” (This is a developing story, more updates coming…) Stay updated with the latest Trending , India , World and US news.

Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Bengaluru: Apparel retailers are banking on a stronger winter season as an on-time, sharper dip in temperatures revives demand for sweaters and jackets after last year’s unusually warm spell left them with excess stock and heavy discounting. This year’s early chill, linked to the onset of La Niña, which typically brings below-normal temperatures across much of India, has pushed consumers to buy winter wear sooner than usual. A longer wedding season is further boosting footfalls, giving retailers a positive start to the upcoming third quarter. Industry estimates suggest that winter sales typically account for about 20% of the total annual sales for apparel companies. “The early indications of winter and the start of the wedding season have clearly lifted early-season sales,\" said Santosh Sreedhar, partner at Avalon Consulting. “This will be an important period to clear last year’s inventory and start next year with fresher styles.\" Poonam Upadhyay, director at Crisil Ratings, added that the overlap in winter and weddings amplifies demand. “Winter matters just as much because it coincides with the wedding season, when demand naturally surges.\" The winter wear market was valued at $12.73 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $22.64 billion by 2033, at a CAGR of 6.16%, according to the India Thermal & Winter Wear report by IMARC Research. Last year’s mild winter was clearly reflected in the sector’s figures, reducing volumes, margins, and sell-through rates. Rahul Mehta, chief mentor of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India (CMAI), said discounting was “deep,\" starting from 30-35% and rising to 50-60% in many cases, adding that volume growth was flat, with a decline in the value of goods sold.

The candid behind-the-scenes footage, shared on Instagram, showed her clad in a grey T-shirt, jeans and suede boots — part of her campaign for the Women project. Rather than focusing on the project’s message or her long-standing advocacy around healthy living, social media commentary swiftly pivoted to a different theory: many users speculated that Michelle Obama has used the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic . Despite the mounting chatter, there is no evidence supporting these claims. Speculation exploded across Instagram and X, with users posting comments such as: “Ozempic - just like everyone on The View who suddenly decided to “get healthy”. I’m not knocking it - but for Christ’s sake- be honest about it!”  “It’s called Ozempic,\" another user wrote. “IS MICHELLE ON OZEMPIC? Michelle Obama sparks Ozempic weight loss rumors after flaunting slender frame in new photoshoot,” the third user asked. “Personal trainer and strict diet? Nah — Ozempic is way easier,” the fourth user wrote. These remarks reflect a growing trend where rapid transformations in public figures trigger assumptions about weight-loss medications. Ozempic contains the active ingredient semaglutide and is approved primarily to treat type-2 diabetes in adults, helping regulate blood sugar and reduce cardiovascular risk. While weight loss may be a secondary effect, Ozempic is not formally approved for cosmetic use or as a standalone slimming treatment.  Celebrities whose physiques shift noticeably often become easy targets for speculation. In Michelle Obama’s case, the visuals sparked speculation that her transformation may not just be fitness or diet-driven. The conversation demonstrates how quickly personal change can turn into public discussion — especially when it converges with trending topics such as GLP-1 drugs.

India's economic growth likely stayed strong at 7.2% in the July-September quarter, albeit down from 7.8% in the previous one, led by continued improvements in rural activity and the statistical effect of a low base and low inflation, according to 15 economists in a Mint poll. The economists projected India’s GDP growth in the range of 7% to 7.7% in the September quarter. The official data is scheduled to be released on Friday. The high projected growth number is likely due in part to a low base. GDP growth had slowed to 5.6% in the same period last year from 6.5% in the preceding quarter. The fact that retail inflation slowed to 1.7% in Q2 from 2.7% in Q1, and wholesale inflation to 0.02% from 0.26%, will also boost the real GDP growth figure, which adjusts current prices for inflation. Growth beyond statistics Beyond statistical effects, high-frequency indicators did show improved growth momentum even before the recent GST rate cuts kicked in. “Pick-up in rural demand indicators have become broad-based, supported by rise in rural wages and second consecutive year of good monsoons,\" said Gaura Sen Gupta, an economist at IDFC First Bank. Yuvika Singhal, an economist at QuantEco Research, pointed out that softer inflation conditions, transmission of earlier monetary policy easing, and inventory build-up in some sectors in anticipation of festive season demand—amplified by GST cuts at the end of September—also contributed to increased economic activity in the quarter.

She says she now has to “justify taking a day off,” something she never had to do abroad.&amp;nbsp;", "content": "A young finance professional has opened up about her decision to return to India for work — and how the reality of corporate life here has left her questioning the move. In a candid Reddit post titled ‘Moved Back to India for Work, Now I’m Seriously Regretting It’, the 26-year-old shared the challenges she has faced since relocating. The user, who completed most of her schooling in Singapore, wrote that India had always felt like home while growing up. She even chose to pursue her undergraduate degree here before moving to London for a master’s programme. London, she said, had been her “childhood dream” — and working there only strengthened her love for the city. However, due to personal reasons, she left her job in the UK and returned to Singapore, where she joined an investment bank. When the company restructured and outsourced her department’s operations to India, she accepted a lower-paying role in the country — hoping it would bring her closer to her roots. But just three months in, she says the experience has been far from what she expected. Calling out what she describes as “boss culture,” office politics and a “lack of boundaries,” the young professional wrote that the transition has been mentally exhausting. “I miss the openness, the structure, and the respect for boundaries,” she said, adding that she now has to “justify taking a day off,” something she never faced abroad. The post has sparked conversation among professionals who have returned after working overseas — many echoing similar concerns about long working hours, micromanagement and skewed work-life balance in Indian corporate culture. The Redditor admits she can’t stop questioning her choice: “Should I have never left London? Or even Singapore?” She ended her message by seeking advice from others on whether she should apply again for jobs in the UK and Europe. “That's why whenever there's a thing between emotions vs brain you should always choose.

He said additional strikes were carried out in the provinces of Kunar and Paktika, injuring four others. According to the report, Pakistan's military and government did not immediately comment on the allegation. The development came more than a month after cross-border clashes erupted when the Afghan government claimed Pakistani drone strikes hit Kabul. The latest escalation follows a deadly attack a day earlier in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar , where two suicide bombers and a gunman stormed the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary. Three officers were killed, and 11 others were wounded in the Monday morning attack. No group has claimed responsibility for the Peshawar attack, but suspicion quickly fell on the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. It is a separate group but closely allied with the Afghan Taliban, and many of its leaders are hiding in Afghanistan. Pakistan has repeatedly urged Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to prevent TTP militants from using Afghan territory to launch attacks. Kabul denies the accusation, but relations further deteriorated after Afghanistan blamed Pakistan for the October 9 drone strikes on its capital and threatened retaliation.

The HC clarified that if someone acquires immovable property through forgery, cheating or criminal conspiracy, and then uses, then uses it for any “downstream activity”, any profit earned from subsequently using that property can be attached as “proceeds of crime” if any such activity is traced to the original tainted property. “This is because the taint attached to the property at its very inception, originated from a criminal activity relatable to a scheduled offence, persists throughout its subsequent use,\" the Bar and Bench quoted the court as saying.

He was then persuaded to purchase another mixture labelled ‘Bhavana Booti Taila’, priced at ₹ 76,000 per gram. To fund the purchases, he borrowed ₹ 17 lakh from his wife and parents.

The development underscores the continuing improvement in relations between the two countries. Following the Modi-Carney meeting, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand stated on Monday that Canada and India will act swiftly on the trade deal, marking a shift in relations following two years of strained ties, according to news agency AP. Anand noted that Ottawa has a new foreign policy in response to US President Donald Trump's trade war and highlighted Carney's aim to double non-US trade within ten years. Easing diplomatic tensions improves investor confidence. The cooling of tensions is a sign of political stability, which reduces the perceived risk for Canadian pension funds, banks, and corporations considering long-term investments in India. A revival in India-Canada economic and strategic engagements — especially through institutional investors, pension funds, and trade-focused agencies — can have a significant ripple effect across India’s capital markets and investment ecosystem.

Experts said $50 billion export is not just an economic milestone but signals a ‘recalibration of trade priorities designed to build resilience and expand high-value sectors.’ “Real progress will depend on restoring strategic trust, and the groundwork being laid today reflects an attempt to undo much of the diplomatic strain experienced during the previous Canadian government,” Prof Sanjal Shastri, Faculty of International Studies, FLAME University, told LiveMint.

Would request all of you to respect the privacy of the families in this sensitive time.\" The wedding initially scheduled for Sunday was slated to take place in Mandhana’s hometown of Sangli. The supposed wedding day was preceded by grand Haldi, Mehndi and Sangeet celebrations but the festivities were abruptly put on hold after Smriti's father Shrinivas Mandhana suffered a sudden health scare. Smriti's manager Tuhin Mishra informed ANI that concerns around Shrinivas Mandhana's health first emerged when he started showing symptoms of a possible heart issue while having breakfast on the fateful day. After his health condition failed to improve, Smriti's family called an ambulance and rushed him to a hospital. As per ANI report, he is under observation at Sarvhit Hospital. Confirming that the 29-year-old cricket star immediately decided to defer the wedding, Tuhin Mishra said, “Smriti is very clear — she wants her father to be okay first, and later she will get married.” According to doctors, his symptoms were likely triggered by “physical or mental stress” from the hectic wedding preparations.

Karan is the younger son of industrialist and Rajya Sabha MP Parimal Nathwani, who serves as Director of Corporate Affairs at Reliance Industries and is known to be a close aide of Mukesh Ambani. While Mukesh Ambani was dressed in formal Indian attire, Nita Ambani opted for a heavily embellished saree for the occasion. The couple was seen greeting guests and posing for photographs at the venue. Anant Ambani also attended the ceremony and appeared in visuals shared online by MLA Shailesh Sotta. Nita Ambani looked radiant in a metallic grey silk saree featuring delicate floral embroidery. The saree was finished with a colourful patti border that added a vibrant touch to the classic drape. She styled it traditionally, letting the embellished pallu fall gracefully over her shoulder. She paired the saree with a contrasting deep indigo-blue blouse, crafted in silk with intricate work on the half sleeves. The fitted silhouette and U-shaped neckline elevated the overall look with modern elegance. For accessories, Nita Ambani opted for statement diamond and emerald jewellery from her personal collection — a layered necklace with striking emerald drops, matching cuffs, circular earrings and a standout ring. Keeping the focus on her ensemble, she tied her hair in a side-parted messy bun and rounded off the look with a red bindi, soft pink lips, glowing skin, defined brows, kohl-rimmed eyes and fluttery lashes — adding a touch of glamour to the festive occasion.

The video, posted by Instagram user Nomadic Teju, shows him in Greater Noida’s Gaur City explaining how his friend’s situation deteriorated after he resigned from his job hoping to find a better opportunity. He points out that flats in the area usually cost between ₹ 1 crore and ₹ 2 crore, while monthly rents can reach ₹ 30,000–35,000. According to him, the engineer had once lived in one of these apartments with his family. But the hiring slowdown left him without work, forcing him to rent out his own flat and move into a rented one instead. With EMIs still pending and no steady income, he is now relying on part-time Rapido rides and occasional freelance projects to get by. The clip has sparked a wider conversation online about the challenges facing tech workers amid AI-related disruptions and limited hiring. “This is just the beginning… A large number of people are already losing their jobs, and even more will lose them in the future,” one user commented. Another wrote, “Long story short - It's going to be more challenging in India… If anyone has chance to move abroad then don't think twice unless you have a good plan.” “Just gona get worse with more AI adoption,” a third user said, advising people to avoid major purchases.

Earlier, lawmakers at the parliamentary session focused on questions about editorial standards raised by Michael Prescott, a former journalist and external editorial standards adviser to the BBC, the Associated Press reported. Prescott was the author of an internal note to BBC bosses that raised concerns about the editing of the Trump speech as well as other instances perceived as showing a left-leaning bias at the broadcaster. Among other things, it alleged that the broadcaster’s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC’s Arabic service. The Daily Telegraph newspaper published that note in early November, sparking the latest crisis. The BBC drew Trump's ire — and deep public scrutiny — after an internal memo compiled by one of its former external advisers was leaked to the British media. The memo criticised cases of alleged biased reporting over a documentary on Trump that was aired days before the 2024 US presidential election, as well as other BBC coverage, including its stance on transgender issues, Gaza and race. Chairman Samir Shah said the broadcaster should have acted much quicker in addressing the allegations.  The third-party production company that made the documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — spliced together three quotes from a speech Trump gave on January 6, 2021, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” The editing made it look like Trump was directly encouraging his supporters to storm the US Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.

Following the revision, Washington and Kyiv described the new draft as a “refined peace framework.” After the Geneva meeting, Zelensky said, “As of now, after Geneva, there are fewer points – no longer 28 – and many of the right elements have been taken into account in this framework. Our team has reported on the new draft of steps, and this is indeed the right approach – I will discuss the sensitive issues with President Trump.” The plan, reduced from 28 provisions to 19, has dropped one of the most contentious elements of Trump's peace proposal – a requirement that Ukraine surrender Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of the Donbas, to Russia, according to the New York Post . Ukraine has called the provision to cede the Luhansk and Donetsk territories to Russia unacceptable. Reports suggest US President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, will meet at a later date to sort out the territorial issue.

Pollution levels were similarly severe in neighbouring cities, with Noida at 419, Greater Noida at 340, and Gurugram at 351. A cloud of volcanic ash from the Hayli Gubbi eruption in Ethiopia has reached Delhi, blanketing parts of the city in a thin layer of haze. IMD director general M Mohapatra told HT that the volcanic plume is not expected to significantly affect Delhi’s pollution levels, as it is travelling at very high altitudes. On air quality, he said it is “unclear whether it will impact air quality, but any significant impact is unlikely as it is at higher levels.” He explained that the ash cloud is currently “nearing Gujarat” and is likely to begin influencing “Delhi-NCR and neighbouring northern India in the next few hours,” though its impact will mainly be felt in aviation. Since the plume is “in the upper-levels,” he noted that its effect near the surface will be limited. Residents may instead observe “a hazy, cloudy sky… its impact expected for a few hours, as it continues to move further eastwards.” Mohapatra added that some cities may experience “a marginal rise in the temperature” because the ash mass behaves like cloud cover.

The sacred saffron flag will convey a message of dignity, unity, and cultural continuity, embodying the ideals of Ram Rajya, the PMO said.

Please do it. You are otherwise killing yourself with each breath you take… Remember Chernobyl? No one wanted to accept the reality because it was scary… We are living in a Chernobyl right now.” The urgency in the doctor’s tone reflects a truth that official data now backs up.

X-ray or coloured MRIs?” The doctor clarified that pollution affects multiple organs over time and not just the lungs: “Air pollution affects your whole body, not just a single area.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

According to a report by Telegraph Money, job vacancies in 2024 have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, by 13.5% to be specific, the lowest since March-May 2021.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable. Research universities and cities that align with your lifestyle and pace. Tip: Avoid overly touristy or high-energy cities if you’re easily drained by crowds. Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.  Studying abroad as an introvert doesn’t mean isolating yourself—but it does mean respecting your energy limits. It’s okay to say no to events or group outings if you need time to recharge. Tip: Let your new friends or roommates know you value alone time. Clear communication helps prevent misunderstandings and builds mutual respect.  Socializing doesn’t have to mean partying or large group events. Look for one-on-one opportunities or small group activities where meaningful connections can develop. Tip: Join interest-based clubs, take art or language class", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/studying-abroad-for-introverts-tips/", "timestamp": 1764069696.179414}

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart. Simply put, how international experience can benefit your career is by opening doors that domestic education often can’t.
