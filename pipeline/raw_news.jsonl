Earlier, NCERT had three separate books for social science in class 7, for history, social and political life, and geography. With the new books released this year, class 7 will use two social science books which touch on all three themes. Part 1 of the social science book was released earlier this year. On India’s relations with Pakistan, the book notes: “Before the 1947 Partition – a legacy of the colonial era that continues to shape the present – Pakistan was a part of India. Let us note for now that Pakistan was founded on religious basis, unlike India; this will be explored further in Grade 8. Suffice to say that these nations share one of the most complex relationships in South Asia.” “Since the Partition, several military conflicts and wars, including wars in 1948, 1965 and 1971, and full-scale conflicts like the Kargil War in 1999, have defined an ongoing tension. In particular, frequent terrorist attacks launched against India with the support of the Pakistan army have prevented normal relations between the two countries,” it said.

Around 32,000 students were enrolled in these courses across the state when the Supreme Court, on November 5 last year, deemed the Uttar Pradesh madarsa education board’s practice of awarding Kamil (graduate-level) and Fazil (postgraduate-level) degrees “unconstitutional”, ruling that such authority lies only with universities regulated under the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act. For Saqlain Raza, a Fazil first-year student at Madarsa Jamia Farooquia in Varanasi, the ruling has forced a major shift. Raza, who has already cleared his first-year Fazil exam, is now preparing to join Kashi Vidyapeeth for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. “I have to think about my career. Given the situation, I will pursue BA, and later, MA,” he told PTI. He said although his Aalim (higher secondary) qualification makes him eligible for BA admission, the years he spent pursuing Kamil and Fazil would effectively go to waste. Raza is not alone. Many students pursuing higher religious studies in madrassas are uncertain about their academic careers. Ghulam Masih, a Kamil first-year student from Madarsa Darul Uloom Faiz-ur-Rasool in Siddharthnagar, said he too is planning to enrol into BA and MA courses from a university. However, he hopes a solution may emerge, noting that a case is pending in court seeking affiliation of madrassa students with Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University. Others, however, feel trapped. Mohammad Saad Nizami, who appeared for the Fazil first-year exam from Madarsa Taleemuddin in Mau district, said his studies have come to a halt. “I took my exam in February 2024 and have already lost nearly one-and-a-half years.

The elected government, several political parties, and many aspirants had urged the JKPSC to postpone the exam. “The examination was successfully conducted at 53 centres across Jammu and Kashmir. Of the total 22,573 registered candidates, 13,732 appeared for the tests — a turnout of 60.83 per cent — in two sessions,” JKPSC Additional Secretary and Controller of Examination, Sachin Jamwal, told PTI. He said the examination was conducted under strict guidelines and supervised by observers and a magistrate stationed at each centre. Asked about the reasons for the low turnout, he said such attendance was usual, noting that in previous examinations too, the turnout had consistently remained around 60 to 61 per cent. Referring to the situation as extraordinary, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote to the JKPSC chairman on Saturday, saying the ongoing disruption in flight services has caused widespread chaos, and it has been “further compounded by the prevailing uncertainty” over the Lok Bhavan’s “delay” in approving age relaxation for aspirants. However, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha refuted the claim that the Lok Bhavan had caused a delay. Sinha wrote on social media that he had returned the file the same day, December 2, with a query about the possibility of holding the examination on the scheduled date if the upper age limit was relaxed, but received no follow-up from the government.

My mother, now retired, always pushed me to study seriously, while my father, an international truck driver who travelled across Africa, showed me what dedication and resilience look like. Watching him cross borders for work made me believe early on that the world is bigger than where you are born—and that education could be my passport to explore it. That mindset is what led me to India. Right after my secondary school, I received admission to Marwadi University in Rajkot, Gujarat, through the Study in India scheme. The programme was meant to strengthen international relations and bring students like me to Indian campuses. The scholarship covered my tuition fees, food, and accommodation, though not my stipend, visa, or travel. I had to take the very first Ind-SAT exam in 2020—conducted across more than 50 countries—to qualify. When the results arrived, I felt genuinely privileged. That scholarship changed the direction of my life. At Marwadi University, I completed my BTech, and by the time I graduated, I knew I wanted to pursue a more specialised path – something that would allow me to contribute to Zambia’s infrastructure development in the future. Construction Technology and Management was the perfect match, and one name kept coming up whenever I discussed my dreams with mentors: IIT Bombay . So I applied through the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) scholarship scheme. For international students, ICCR manages the entire admission process. There is no Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) or Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) requirement; selection is merit-based, depending on academic record and overall competence.

The section on the Ghaznavid invasions is preceded by a box that contains “a word of caution”. The box is similar to the “note on history’s darker periods”, which was published in the class 8 textbook, placed before the chapter on the Delhi Sultanate. The box in the class 7 textbook refers to this note and states that it explains how history has recorded war, conquest and destruction more than peace, good governance or creativity, and how the world over historians have sometimes hesitated to draw attention to such darker periods. “Our approach is that it is better to face them and analyse them so as to understand what made such developments possible and, hopefully, help avoid their recurrence in future. In addition, we should not forget that while past events cannot be erased or denied, it would be wrong to hold anyone responsible for them today,” it reads. The new textbook is meant for use in the ongoing academic session. Part 1 of the textbook was released earlier this year. The old NCERT class 7 history textbook had a paragraph on the Mahmud of Ghazni. It pointed out that rulers tried to demonstrate their power and resources by building large temples, and chose to target temples which were sometimes extremely rich when they attacked kingdoms. It referred to the Mahmud of Ghazni as having raided the subcontinent 17 times with a religious motive, targeting wealthy temples and taking away their wealth. ‘The Ghaznavid Invasions’ section has about six pages including boxes and pictures. It details Mahmud’s 17 campaigns in India, his plunder of a temple in Mathura, temples in Kannauj and the destruction of the Somanatha Shiva temple in Somnath, Gujarat.

As per the guidelines, only the top 2,50,000 successful candidates across all categories in the JEE Main 2026 BE/BTech paper will be shortlisted, in accordance with a fixed category-wise distribution. The institute has also reiterated conditions related to age, number of attempts and Class XII qualification. This year, the examination will be held on May 17, Sunday. Under Criterion A1, candidates must be among the top 2,50,000 performers in JEE Main 2026 (BE/BTech paper). The shortlisting for JEE Advanced follows a rigid category-wise percentage: 10% GEN-EWS, 27% OBC-NCL, 15% SC, 7.5% ST and 40.5% OPEN, with 5% horizontal reservation for PwD candidates within each of these categories. IIT Roorkee has clarified that the total may marginally exceed 2.5 lakh if “tied” ranks occur. IIT Roorkee has also noted that OCI/PIO (I) candidates are not eligible for any reserved category benefits, except under OPEN-PwD if applicable. They must qualify strictly in the OPEN lists. To be eligible, candidates must have been born on or after October 1, 2001. A relaxation of five years applies to SC, ST and PwD candidates, meaning they should have been born on or after October 1, 1996. Additionally, a candidate can appear for JEE Advanced only twice in two consecutive years, meaning prior attempts must fall within this two-year window. The exam maintains its long-standing rule of allowing only two attempts in two consecutive years. This means students must plan their Class 12 and JEE Main timelines carefully, as any earlier appearance than 2025 immediately disqualifies them from appearing in 2026. Candidates should have appeared in Class XII (or equivalent) for the first time in 2025 or 2026, with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as mandatory subjects.

Instead, the highest-ranked students overwhelmingly prefer central government institutions like PGIMER, other AIIMS-affiliated hospitals, JIPMER, and long-established state-run colleges such as Madras Medical College (MMC), Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC), and KEM Mumbai. Since 2016, the Centre has been releasing a list of top colleges under various categories, including medical. In these nine years, AIIMS Delhi has been the undisputed number 1 . The trend, visible year after year, raises an important question: if NIRF rankings claim to evaluate the “best” institutions, then why are students opting otherwise? And what does this reveal about the effectiveness and limitations of India’s most publicised ranking mechanism for higher education? The NEET-PG 2025 round 1 allotment list reinforces the same trend seen every year: top-ranked candidates choose Central and state government medical colleges, not the private institutions ranked higher on the NIRF list. According to the allotment document, All India Rank (AIR) 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 – all opted for PGIMER at Dr RML Hospital, New Delhi , one of the most sought-after central institutions for MD (General Medicine). Rank 2 chose Government Medical College, Kozhikode – a state-run institution with strong clinical exposure. Rank 4 and Rank 10 chose Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC), New Delhi, another major government medical college attached to Safdarjung Hospital, known for its massive patient load and intensive training environment.

The teacher draws a free-body diagram. One student nods confidently, another is still hunting for a missing vector, and someone at the back is hoping calculus doesn’t enter the room. And that is the real point — no matter which one of these three you were, this same school physics is the foundation for both Electrical Engineering (EE) and Engineering Physics (EP). Mechanics, waves, optics, electromagnetism — all of it returns, only deeper. The first year of both degrees is almost identical. If school physics made sense, you’ll be fine. If it didn’t… at least now you know early. The split starts in second year. EE is for students who like opening gadgets just to see what lives inside. It moves straight into circuits, electronics, motors, power systems, communication engineering, sensors, and robotics. Those neat textbook diagrams finally become real lab devices — the kind the instructor warns you not to drop because “this one is expensive.” In EE, you finally understand: – Why radio stations sit 0.2 MHz apart – Why ABS reacts before you even realise the tyre slipped- Why mobile antennas are tiny but radio antennas look like towers – How a prosthetic arm reads muscle activity Everything leads to real-world use. You build machines and circuits, test them, debug them, and watch them run. That is EE’s biggest strength — you see results quickly. Career options are wide, starting from consumer electronics, renewable energy, automobiles, telecom, defence, aviation, medical devices, manufacturing, power plants, and roles in ISRO or Tesla-type companies.

In a first, the Ministry has shared a total of 6,28,305 (6.28 lakh) are enrolled at the school-level. In the previous year, MEA had reported 13.3 lakh students in higher education alone, which means that the 2025 figure marks a decline in university-level enrolments year-on-year. When considering the combined tally of school and higher education students, the overall 2025 number is higher only because school data was added for the first time. The top three destinations in 2025 across both schooling and university education were the United Arab Emirates (2,53,832 students), the United States (2,55,447 students), and Canada (4,27,085 students), making them the largest hubs of Indian students globally. MEA data shows a trend, that the number of Indian students in higher education overseas had risen consistently between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, there were 7.5 lakh students abroad in universities; this increased to 9.3 lakh in 2023 and reached a peak of 13.3 lakh in 2024. In contrast, the 2025 figure of 12.54 lakh shows a drop from last year, marking the first decline after three years of steady growth. This reversal comes at a time when several major destination countries have undergone significant policy shifts and diplomatic fluctuations affecting Indian student mobility over the past two years.

A question on the high dropout rate in Delhi government schools was asked by Swati Maliwal to the Ministry of Education in the Rajya Sabha during the Winter Session of the Parliament. Over the past five academic years shows that approximately 22.22 per cent of the total failed students transitioned into the NIOS system, informs the Minister of State Jayant Chaudhary. This percentage is derived from the 71,124 students admitted to NIOS compared to the 3,20,150 students who failed Class 9 during the years in question. Maliwal questioned whether the government is aware that, over the past 10 years, a large number of Class 9 students in Delhi , who failed, have been forced by the Delhi Government into NIOS, which has resulted in high dropout rates in schools. One of the key objectives of the National Institute of Open Schooling ( NIOS ) is to prevent students from government schools who face repeated academic failures from dropping out of the education system. To support their continued learning, NIOS enables such students to rejoin formal schooling in their parent institution once they successfully complete Class 10 through NIOS, said the Minister in the Rajya Sabha . The failing rate case also stands true for Class 10 students. Under the ‘NIOS Project,’ an average of 70 per cent of students who took the Class 10 examination have failed in the last four years — this was revealed by the Delhi Directorate of Education (DoE) in response to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by PTI.

The new law will take effect next year, making Chile the latest country to restrict smartphone use among young students to reduce its harmful effects and curb classroom distractions. Other nations with various levels of restrictions on smartphone use at schools include France, Brazil, Hungary, the Netherlands and China. “We are advancing a cultural change for children and adolescents who today, more than ever, need to see each other’s faces again, socialise during recess, and regain concentration to further boost learning,” Education Minister Nicolás Cataldo wrote on social media after the decision. The Senate already approved the school cellphone ban in principle earlier this year, but made several changes that were put to a vote late Tuesday in Chile’s lower house of Congress. After a debate, lawmakers overwhelmingly endorsed the updated legislation banning smartphone use during class hours — except during emergencies and for educational and other purposes specified under the law. The bill must be signed by President Gabriel Boric before taking effect nationwide at the start of the 2026 school year. In response to rising concerns about young people and their mental health, parents and teachers in Chile have lobbied for such a law for years, arguing that the use of smartphones impairs students’ learning and emotional development.

How you answer this question will help determine whether you gain admission to an NIT , IIIT , GFTI , or go on to qualify for JEE Advanced. With increasing competition from previous years and changes in cut-off scores year to year, understanding the definition of a good score for JEE is essential to help guide you in setting the proper benchmark to prepare for the test. Students generally talk about the number of marks achieved out of a total of 300; however, the National Testing Agency does not use raw scores when calculating a student’s score (where a student places) for the JEE Main. Instead, a percentile (0 – 100) is assigned for each of the sessions held on the test day. The best NTA percentile from all your attempts will be considered in determining your rank.

The Maharashtra government recently renewing its efforts to officially rename IIT Bombay as IIT ‘ Mumbai ’, has renewed the debate beyond a mere change of signage. It reaches into history, of the institute, of the city, and of how names become repositories of identity and legacy. According to the institute’s own archival notes, IIT Bombay was set up in 1958 as the second IIT in India, after IIT Kharagpur in Bengal, and the first to receive foreign assistance, with UNESCO arranging funds provided by the Soviet Union. With the newly independent nation investing in scientific capacity-building, the first cohort of just 100 students began classes in Worli, even as the Powai campus was still under construction. The 1961 Institutes of Technology Act declared all IITs as Institutes of National Importance. Over the decades, IIT Bombay expanded steadily with new departments, advanced research centres, interdisciplinary labs, incubators, and a postgraduate ecosystem that would produce thousands of researchers. But the rise of IIT Bombay was also inseparable from the city that housed it, a city whose own history of names reflects centuries of shifting rule, culture, and political imagination.

The exam, which selects candidates for central government roles and their branches, saw roughly 98 applicants competing for every available post, according to official data. Authorities also disclosed that approximately 70 per cent of the vacancies are earmarked for fresh college graduates, according to a report of the China Internet Information Center. The sweeping changes this year stem from a major policy shift: the general age cap for aspirants has been raised from 35 to 38 years, while fresh graduates holding master’s or doctoral degrees can now sit for the exam up to age 43, a considerable increase from prior limits (which were 35 and 40, respectively). Beijing has framed the reforms as part of efforts to adjust to shifting demographic realities, including a shrinking working-age population and an increasing trend of prolonged education and delayed workforce entry. Analysts suggest the revised age limits also help counter pervasive “ageism” in the job market and harness the skills of slightly older or more experienced candidates for public service.

While the peak of the major pan-Indian festive season has typically passed, the month features significant regional events and celebrations across the country, including the Hornbill Festival in Nagaland, the Feast of St. Francis Xavier in Goa, the Rann Utsav in Gujarat, as well as Christmas and New Year festivities. Academically, December is an important time, often marking the season for term-end examinations in schools, and for senior classes, the beginning of pre-board exam season. With the winter season now setting in across many parts of the country, here is an overview of when schools, colleges, and other educational institutes typically observe their scheduled winter breaks and closures in the month of December. In Uttar Pradesh, schools are scheduled to remain shut from December 20 to December 31, forming the main winter break for students. This period typically provides around 10–12 days of vacation, covering both Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Similarly, in states such as Madhya Pradesh, many government, private, and centrally affiliated schools begin their winter or Christmas break from December 23 or 24, extending until December 31 or, in some cases, the first week of January.

B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh. Their support made me see research as a meaningful path to solving real problems.

This is the time when most students are juggling multiple demands—revision, full-length syllabus coverage, coaching classes, test series, and the pressure to meet their own expectations. As the exam inches closer, it is natural to experience stress and a sense of urgency to perform well. Amidst all this, aspirants often look for methods that can make their preparation more effective, structured, and result-oriented. Among all the activities that make up the preparation cycle – from reading coaching notes, watching lectures, solving modules, and developing personalised study strategies – one of the most powerful tools available to every student is the Mock Test. But simply taking a mock test is not enough. The real value lies in taking each mock seriously, approaching it with exam-like discipline, analysing the results with patience and depth, and learning something meaningful from every attempt.

They also play a major role in helping students understand their strengths and weaknesses while improving their test-taking skills. Before taking mock tests regularly, the first and most important step is to ensure that you choose the right mock tests. Not all mock tests available online or offline are equally useful, and selecting the wrong ones can result in either overconfidence or unnecessary fear. To identify which mock series is right for you, you must check whether the test pattern aligns with the latest JEE Main structure – the difficulty level, types of questions asked, marking scheme, and balance of topics.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said. Schools are required to upload their admission criteria and point allocation for open seats (other than EWS, DG, and CWSN categories) by November 28. The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office. These include engineering, IT, especially roles in cybersecurity, software development, data analytics, and network administration.

Singh commended UPSC’s ‘Pratibha Setu’ portal , which seeks to create new opportunities for candidates who have cleared the civil services examination stages but did not make it to the final selection, by connecting them with private sector and institutional openings. He termed the move “an innovative bridge between talent and opportunity,” ensuring that India’s intellectual potential is not lost but leveraged for national development. The minister also emphasised UPSC’s larger role beyond recruitment, framing and updating service rules, reviewing administrative practices, and setting ethical standards for public service.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing.

The company has secured strategic partnerships with LG CNS and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to develop its ecosystem. Investor interest in AI robotics has been steadily growing. Physical Intelligence, another company developing “brains” for a broad range of robots, has reportedly recently raised $600 million at a $5.6 billion valuation led by CapitalG. One investor who evaluated but declined to fund Physical Intelligence told TechCrunch that its model is still in the early stages of development.

The Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor , to approved customers in the country.

H200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported. An Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: “We applaud President Trump’s decision to allow America’s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.” The news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump’s hands . The decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security. Pete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years. The Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It’s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips. While Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China — on both sides of the aisle — President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.

The tech giant says the idea behind the new feed is to display recommendations so users can discover and virtually try on new items. Nearly everything in the feed is shoppable, with direct links to merchants. The discovery feed features AI-generated videos of real products and suggests outfits based on your personalized style. Google determines your style by analyzing the preferences you share with Doppl and the items you interact with. The move comes as short-form video feeds, particularly on TikTok and Instagram, have conditioned users to scroll visual feeds and buy what they see. However, unlike on TikTok and Instagram, where real influencers showcase products, Google’s new feed only consists of AI-generated content. While some may not be fond of an AI-generated feed, Google likely sees it as a way to surface products in a format that people are already used to. Plus, it makes sense for the company to try a new e-commerce strategy, especially as it continues to lose ground to companies like Amazon and social media platforms. It’s worth noting that AI-generated videos aren’t new to Doppl. While the app creates images of a virtual version of yourself wearing different outfits, it can turn these static images and convert them into AI-generated videos. The purpose of this is to give you a better sense of how the outfit would look on you in real life. The new discovery feed is rolling out to Doppl on iOS and Android in the U.S. for users 18 and above. Although a feed consisting solely of AI-generated content would have seemed strange a year ago, the idea is now gaining traction. For example, OpenAI in September launched Sora , a social media platform of just AI videos.

Bach claims to have been targeted because of his German heritage. Bach first learned about the disparaging comment in mid-2025 — months after the investigation into workplace culture was launched and after losing some responsibilities at the company, according to the complaint. He encouraged a co-worker to report the incident. TechCrunch has reached out to Lucid and will update the article if the company comments on the lawsuit. Bach claims Lucid Motors “confirmed” the HR executive made the remark. Bach logged an internal complaint against another Lucid vice president for similarly racist behavior. He claims Lucid Motors retaliated by trying to force him to resign in October 2025. Lucid fired Bach on November 5, 2025, according to the lawsuit. Lucid Motors’ press release from that day only said he had “departed.” The lawsuit comes during a tricky moment for Lucid Motors. The company is burning through cash as it works to ramp up production of its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV. It is developing more affordable mass-market vehicles on a midsized platform slated to debut sometime in late 2026. Lucid has also been churning through executives.

The firm sent a letter to potential limited partners, according to a copy obtained by CNBC , seeking to raise the cash for a vehicle called Private Investment Partners 17 (PIP 17). The letter also promises a more humble approach than during the 2021 bull-market madness. During that time, Tiger Global was moving fast and investing abundantly, a method the venture industry calls “spray and pray.” PIP 15, raised in 2021, was a whopping $12.7 billion fund that pumped cash into startups at a blinding pace largely at peak valuations, TechCrunch reported . In 2021 alone, the hedge fund backed 315 startups , according to PitchBook data, and spurred bidding wars among VCs to get stakes in even unproven startups that ratcheted up valuations. When interest rates rose, the party was over, and startups spent years trying to live up to their 2021 valuations, many shuttering along the way . After the venture market crash in 2022-23, prolific Tiger Global investor John Curtius left to start his own fund , and Scott Shleifer, the firm’s chief of private equity investments, transitioned to an advisory role , while Tiger’s famed founder, Chase Coleman, took on a more direct role. Tiger Global went on to raise a much smaller PIP 16 fund of $2.2 billion in 2024, Bloomberg reported at the time, which is, admittedly, still an enormous fund. Now, on the strength of PIP 16’s blockbuster AI investments, Tiger Global is raising Fund 17. PIP 16 holds stakes in OpenAI, Waymo and Databricks, all of which have had skyrocketing valuations and driven this fund’s paper gains by 33% so far, the letter said as reported by CNBC.

More than 230 organizations, including Food & Water Watch, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace signed a public letter urging members of Congress to support a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers, citing rising electricity and water consumption. “The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter reads. Several studies have linked higher energy prices to the arrival of new data centers in a region. Consumers have been arriving at similar conclusions: A recent survey, commissioned by solar installer Sunrun, found that eight in 10 consumers were worried about data centers negatively affecting their utility bills. Electricity prices have already shot up 13% this year, bigger than any annual increase in the past decade. The effects are expected to be felt most in a handful of states, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, and New Jersey, which are slated for the largest increase in data center capacity. Energy demand for data centers is expected to nearly triple in the coming decade, up from 40 gigawatts today to 106 gigawatts in 2035.

It's part of a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could reshape software workflows.", "content": "Anthropic is launching Claude Code in Slack, allowing developers to delegate coding tasks directly from chat threads. The beta feature, available Monday as a research preview, builds on Anthropic’s existing Slack integration by adding full workflow automation. The rollout signals that the next frontier in coding assistants isn’t the model; it’s the workflow. Previously, developers could only get lightweight coding help via Claude in Slack — like writing snippets, debugging, and explanations. Now they can tag @Claude to spin up a complete coding session using Slack context like bug reports or feature requests. Claude analyzes recent messages to determine the right repository, posts progress updates in threads, and shares links to review work and open pull requests. The move reflects a broader industry shift: AI coding assistants are migrating from IDEs (integrated development environment, where software development happens) into collaboration tools where teams already work. Cursor offers Slack integration for drafting and debugging code in threads, while GitHub Copilot recently added features to generate pull requests from chat. OpenAI’s Codex is accessible via custom Slack bots. For Slack, positioning itself as an “ agentic hub ” where AI meets workplace context creates a strategic advantage: Whichever AI tool dominates Slack — the center of engineering communication — could shape how software teams work. By letting developers move seamlessly from conversation to code without switching apps, Claude Code and similar tools represent a shift toward AI-embedded collaboration that could fundamentally change developer workflows. While Anthropic has not yet confirmed when it would make a broader rollout available, the timing is strategic.

However, these agentic capabilities also come with security risks that could lead to loss of data or money. Google detailed its approach to handling user security on Chrome using observer models and consent for user action. The company previewed agentic capabilities on Chrome in September and said these features will roll out in the coming months. The company said it is using the help of a few models to keep agentic actions in check. Google said it built a User Alignment Critic using Gemini to scrutinize the action items built by the planner model for a particular task. If the critic model thinks that the planned tasks don’t serve the user’s goal, it asks the planner model to rethink the strategy. Google noted that the critic model only sees the metadata of the proposed action and not the actual web content. What’s more, to prevent agents from accessing disallowed or untrustworthy sites, Google is using Agent Origin Sets, which restrict the model to access read-only origins and read-writeable origins. Read-only origin is data that Gemini is permitted to consume content from. For instance, on a shopping site, the listings are relevant to the task, but banner ads aren’t. Similarly, Google said the agent is only allowed to click or type on certain iframes of a page. “This delineation enforces that only data from a limited set of origins is available to the agent, and this data can only be passed on to the writable origins. This bounds the threat vector of cross-origin data leaks. This also gives the browser the ability to enforce some of that separation, such as by not even sending to the model data that is outside the readable set,” the company said in a blog post. Google is also keeping a check on page navigation by investigating URLs through another observer model.

The relationship between OpenAI and Instacart seems to have only deepened after former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo — who was already an OpenAI board member — joined the company as the CEO of Applications in May. Agentic commerce — the use of AI tools to do shopping research and make purchases on a user’s behalf — is a current priority for OpenAI. Its most recent dev day focused on its plan to build apps into ChatGPT .

Paramount is going straight to WBD’s shareholders with an all-cash offer of $30 per share, and it noted that its offer provides shareholders $18 billion more cash than the Netflix deal, which offered $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in Netflix shares for a total of $27.75 per share. Paramount is bidding for all of WBD, while Netflix’s deal with the company only includes its Hollywood studios and streaming business. CNBC reported on Monday that these were the very terms from Paramount that WBD’s board rejected a week ago. “We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process,” Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement . Paramount’s offer is backstopped with equity financing from the Ellison family and the private-equity firm RedBird Capital, in addition to $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi, and Apollo. Netflix came out on top on Friday after winning a bidding war against Paramount and Comcast, but Paramount’s hostile bid is sure to drag on the battle for one of Hollywood’s most iconic studios, a fight which has already stretched out for months. Netflix’s proposed deal has already raised antitrust questions, as it would combine two of the most popular streaming platforms into one. Additionally, President Donald Trump has said the deal “could be a problem” because of the size of the combined companies’ market share. A deal between WBD and Paramount would also likely raise similar concerns. Netflix agreed to pay WBD $5.8 billion if the deal doesn’t go through. WBD would have to pay Netflix $2.8 billion if it decides to call off the deal. Netflix did not immediately respond to a req", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/paramount-goes-to-war-with-netflix-for-warner-bros-discovery-with-hostile-108-4b-bid/", "timestamp": 1765262810.0622768}

The tech giant said it would offer $31 for each Confluent share, which is about 50% more than what the smaller company’s shares closed at on Friday, before news of the deal. Confluent offers a platform that helps enterprises manage streams of data in real time, a use case that’s exploded in demand as ever more companies develop and deploy AI products, which require significant back-and-forth processing of data for inferencing. IBM said Confluent will complement its existing data and automation products, as well as improve upon its existing offerings across AI, automation, data, and consulting. The company expects the deal to add to EBITDA and free cash flow in the two years after the deal is closed. This is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant’s largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024. IBM in October signed a deal with AI lab Anthropic to deploy the Claude large language model into some of its products; it has partnered with AMD to develop a new computing architecture that combines quantum systems with AI-specialized chips; and it acquired data analysis startup Seek AI in June.

The new space gives creators access to exclusive templates, transitions, and effects, along with the ability to instantly publish Shorts to their YouTube channels directly from their phones. The company says the space is designed to give creators everything they need to produce viral videos, grow their audience, and tap into trends, whether it’s creating day-in-the-life vlogs, travel videos, or behind-the-scenes clips. By partnering with Adobe, YouTube is giving creators on its platform an exclusive space to create content, encouraging them to use its partners’ space instead of competitors’ tools, like Meta’s Edits or CapCut, which is owned by TikTok parent ByteDance. “Although content edited in Premiere mobile can be shared to other social platforms, what’s unique about this partnership is that creators getting inspiration from their YouTube Shorts feed, can launch a template that caught their eye, directly into Premiere mobile and start customizing it for their own channel,” said Meagan Keane, director, Product Marketing, Digital Video and Audio at Adobe, in an email to TechCrunch. “This content creation space within the Premiere mobile app is designed and optimized for YouTube Shorts.” The Create for YouTube Shorts content creation space in Premiere mobile features Shorts templates from top creators with built-in text, effects, and transition presets. Creators can add their own media and customize the templates to their style. They also have the option to create and submit their own original templates. To get started, creators need a free Premiere mobile login to access the space and a YouTube profile to publish directly to their Shorts feed. Creators can download Adobe Premiere from the App Store and tap the “Create for YouTube” option to access the creation space.

It often leads to this awkward silence, putting all the pressure on one person to make the first move. Instead of coming up with something interesting to say, some just fall back on the same old lines or stick to boring small talk, like asking, “How are you?” To address this issue, Hinge unveiled “Convo Starters,” a feature powered by AI that provides personalized tips for initiating conversations. The feature aims to inspire daters and boost their confidence when sending initial messages. When users like a profile, they’ll now see three tailored tips beneath each photo and prompt. The AI evaluates a user’s profile and generates recommendations based on the individual photos or prompts. For example, if a potential match is pictured playing chess, Hinge might suggest beginning the conversation around board games. Convo Starters was developed in response to user feedback, Hinge says. The company’s research indicated that 72% of Hinge daters are more inclined to consider someone when a like is accompanied by a message. Data from Hinge reveals that those who include a comment with their likes are twice as likely to arrange a date. This new feature follows the launch of its AI-driven Prompt Feedback feature, which assesses user prompts and offers tailored advice aimed at improving them by urging users to elaborate and share engaging details about their lives. However, as Hinge incorporates AI features into its app, many users, especially Gen Z, are uncomfortable with the thought of using AI in their online dating experiences. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z feels more uneasy about using AI for tasks such as drafting profile prompts and responding to messages than older generations do. Hinge’s parent company, Match Group, is dedicating around $20 million to $30 million toward AI efforts.

The findings arrive a week after CEO Sam Altman sent an internal “code red” memo about the competitive threat of Google. The timing underscores OpenAI’s push to reframe its position as the enterprise AI leader, even as it faces mounting pressures. While close to 36% of U.S. businesses are ChatGPT Enterprise customers compared to 14.3% for Anthropic, per Ramp AI Index , the majority of OpenAI’s revenue still comes from consumer subscriptions — a base that’s being threatened by Google’s Gemini. OpenAI also must compete against rival AI firm Anthropic — whose revenue comes mainly from B2B sales — and, increasingly, open-weight model providers for enterprise customers. The AI giant has committed $1.4 trillion to infrastructure commitments over the next few years, making enterprise growth essential to its business model. “If you think about it from an economic growth perspective, consumers really matter,” Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, said during a briefing. “But when you look at historically transformative technologies like the steam engine, it’s when firms adopt and scale these technologies that you really see the biggest economic benefits.” OpenAI’s new findings suggest that adoption among larger enterprises is not only growing but becoming more integrated into workflows. Employees aren’t only sending more messages — organizations using OpenAI’s API (its developer interface) are consuming 320 times more “reasoning tokens” than they were a year ago, suggesting companies are using AI for more complex problem-solving. That, or they are experimenting heavily with the new tech and burning through tokens, without necessarily getting long-term value.

Lawmakers Just Took It Away", "summary": "The final language of the annual bill that funds the US military is in. It removes provisions that would have helped ensure service members’ ability to fix their own equipment.", "content": "US lawmakers have removed provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2026 that would have ensured military members’ right to repair their own equipment. The final language of the NDAA was shared by the House Armed Services Committee on Sunday, after weeks of delays pushed the annual funding bill to the end of the year. Among a host of other language changes made as part of reconciling different versions of the legislation drafted by the Senate and the House of Representatives, two provisions focused on the right to repair—Section 836 of the Senate bill and Section 863 of the House bill—have both been removed. Also gone is Section 1832 of the House version of the bill, which repair advocates worried could have implemented a “data-as-a-service” relationship with defense contractors that would have forced the military to pay for subscription repair services. As reported by WIRED in late November, defense contractor lobbying efforts seem to have worked to convince lawmakers who led the conference process, including Mike Rogers, a Republican from Alabama who is chair of the House Armed Services Committee, and ranking member Adam Smith of Washington, to pull the repair provisions, which enjoyed bipartisan support and was championed by the Trump administration, from the act. The move is a blow to the broader right-to-repair movement, which advocates for policies that make it easier for device users, owners, or third parties to work on and repair devices without needing to get—or pay for—manufacturer approval. But while ensuring repair rights for service members did not make the final cut, neither did the competing effort to make the military dependent on repair-as-a-service subscription plans. “For decades, the Pentagon has relied on a broken acquisition system that is routinely defended by career bureaucrats and corporate interests,” wrote senators Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, and Tim Sheehy, a Republican of Montana, in a joint statement sha", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-military-almost-got-the-right-to-repair-lawmakers-just-took-it-away/", "timestamp": 1765262811.8331614}

With several teams across CMS hosting holiday gatherings this month, I am sharing some strategies to help you make healthier choices—while still indulging in festive treats,” Oz wrote in his latest missive, which appears as a recurring section in his weekly bulletin titled “From the Administrator’s Desk,” according to emails viewed by WIRED. “Set your intentions,” writes Oz. “Decide in advance how many treats you’ll allow yourself to enjoy and try to stick to that number. You don’t have to try every cookie on the cookie table.” His email continues with further guidance: “practice portion control,” “be mindful,” and “don’t double fist,” he tells the agency’s more than 6,000 employees. He advises subordinates to “eat off a small plate when you can and take small portions of treats so you can enjoy them without overeating,” to eat more slowly (“Savor each bite, put your fork down between bites, and pay attention to your body’s cues,” he counsels), and not to hold food and beverages in more than one hand so as to free up “the other for shaking hands with colleagues and friends during this festive period.” This kind of advice has appeared in Oz’s emails since early November. In the past, Oz has promoted a number of unproven medical tips surrounding weight loss. He at one time pushed weight-loss solutions that he subsequently admitted in a 2014 Senate subcommittee hearing “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact.” (Oz had promoted one such product on his show as “magic,” claiming, “You may think magic is make-believe, but this little bean has scientists saying they’ve found the magic weight-loss cure for every body type—it’s green co", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/dr-oz-centers-for-medicare-and-medicaid-services-tells-employees-to-eat-less/", "timestamp": 1765262811.9469776}

This is one of the core features in Sora, OpenAI’s app for sharing AI videos inside a TikTok-style feed. The self-deepfaking feature was called “cameo,” and with that standout feature, Sora quickly rose to the top of Apple’s iOS download charts. This feature name led to a trademark lawsuit with Cameo , the app where fans can pay celebrities to record personalized videos. Now, because of the legal action, OpenAI has temporarily scrubbed the “cameo” branding from its Sora app . The app now refers to the feature as “characters.” Creative originality is not achievable by generative AI , which is built on finding patterns in large datasets, and OpenAI seems to be matching this derivative vibe with its naming schemas. In addition to being told to remove “cameo” from Sora, OpenAI was also recently ordered not to call its upcoming hardware device “io,” in response to a separate lawsuit from a company named “iyO” that’s already building an AI-powered hardware device. According to update logs on OpenAI’s website, the company removed the name for the Sora feature over a week after US District Judge Eumi K. Lee issued a temporary restraining order. The judge’s order blocked OpenAI from using “cameo” or variations of the word. The next hearing, which may decide whether this ban sticks, is scheduled for December 19. Discussions between Cameo and OpenAI have been “pretty nonexistent,” according to Steven Galanis, the CEO of Cameo. “They clearly knew Cameo existed. They knew we had trademarks on it,” he said in a call with WIRED shortly after the judge issued the temporary restraining order. “They chose the name anyway.” He sees this lawsuit as an “existential” battle over the word “cameo” and the app’s brand he has built over the past eight years. “When people think about the word, now it means something different than authentic persona", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/openai-cameo-products-that-already-exist/", "timestamp": 1765262812.0531492}

The scientists mantain that identifying this genetic risk factor opens up the possibility of designing preventive therapies in the future. The GRIN2A gene regulates communication between neurons by producing the GluN2A protein. When functioning optimally, it promotes the transmission of electrical signals between nerve cells and facilitates essential processes such as learning, memory, language, and brain development. In their article, published in Molecular Psychiatry , the researchers demonstrated that the gene mutation reduces the activity of the NMDA electrical receptor, which aids in neuronal communication, thereby increasing the risk of developing mental disorders. Of the 121 individuals studied, 85 had a GRIN2A variant and 23 of them developed a mental illness. These results show that carriers of the mutation have a significantly higher risk than those without variations. Furthermore, the patients exhibited strictly psychiatric symptoms, which largely rules out environmental or contextual explanations. The finding contradicts the general consensus on the polygenic origin of mental disorders. Until now, clinicians have considered that these diseases arise from the interaction of multiple factors, including genetic ones. This study demonstrates for the first time that a mutation in a single gene can decisively influence the development of a mental disorder. The report also cites previous research that treated NMDA receptor deficiency, caused by the GRIN2A mutation, with L-serine, an amino acid. The four schizophrenia patients who participated in the trial showed remarkable improvements: disappearance of hallucinations, remission of paranoia symptoms, and improved behavior after receiving the treatment.

From tiny, $25 devices that will fit in a pocket, to massive, $400-plus boom boxes that require a built-in handle or shoulder strap, there’s a Bluetooth speaker for nearly every budget and gathering size. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for yet another model, as JBL proves with its new $100 JBL Grip. It’s essentially a smaller and lighter version of the company’s hugely popular Flip series, placing it between the Flip 7 and the JBL Go 4/Clip 5 on the portability scale. For some folks, that’s going to be the goldilocks zone. But just to sweeten the deal, JBL has reached into its toolbox and given the Grip an integrated LED light show, clearly inspired by the brand’s popular PartyBox lineup of party speakers. In keeping with JBL’s colorful approach to its smallest speakers, the Grip is available in red, white, black, purple, “squad” (a camo motif), and blue (pictured here). It’s 32 percent smaller than the JBL Flip 7— but it’s the Grip’s weight that will make throwing it in a backpack feel like an easy decision: At 0.8 pounds, the Grip is less than half the weight of the Flip 7 (1.8 pounds), making it light enough to hang from tree branches that would buckle under the Flip 7. JBL Grip Rating: 7/10 Despite the Grip’s smaller size, JBL pegs battery life on both speakers at the same 14-hour maximum. On the Grip at least, that might be overpromising. When I ran the speaker at 50 percent volume continuously, I only got about 10.5 hours. Using JBL’s PlayTime Boost mode could help if you really need to eke out a few more songs. The familial similarities continue with the Grip’s ability to withstand the elements. Like the Flip 7, it’s rated IP68, making it effectively dust- and waterproof. They’re both shockproof, and yet the Grip is arguably more durable, since both ends are solid silicone rubber.

There's such a rush of books at the end of the year that I usually make a couple stacks at the far end of my desk, then attack them methodically, but this book was different. The cover was inviting, like I landed in a party where the drinks and people looked fun and beautiful, and at the same time it immediately started answering questions about the food and culture. Amazingly, that serendipity happened five times this fall. What makes this group of books unique is that they are all artistic big swings. It’s almost like the authors, photographers, editors, and art department folks stood in a circle, put their hands in the middle, counted to three, and shouted “go for broke!” There have been isolated versions of similar greatness in the past few years, often in surprising corners of the cookbook kingdom. Recent favorites include Koreaworld , Korean American , Start Here , Oaxaca , Big Dip Energy , and maybe even Molly Baz's trippy More Is More . The resulting efforts opened me up like a favorite piece of art, making me happy and making learning effortless, everything working together to draw me in further. My hope is that this is the start of a new way forward, because once you start comparing this bunch with older cookbooks or those from publishers with rigid and repetitive styles, those quickly start to look boring. This year's bumper crop looks at salsa, instant ramen noodles, drinking culture, a country, and home baking.

Runners laced up one of the few models available and made it work, whatever the terrain. However, in 2025, it’s all very different. We now have running shoes tailored to every type of run: daily trainers, carbon racers, easy-day recovery shoes, speed session super trainers, tempo shoes. Trail running isn’t immune to the endless subcategories, and the newest niche is gravel shoes—a subset of trail running shoes designed specifically for mixed-terrain runs across compacted gravel paths, forest roads, hard-pack trails, and regular old roads. But are the brands just repackaging trail running shoes with smaller lugs? Or do gravel shoes genuinely offer something new and different? Here’s everything you need to know about trail’s latest footwear trend. (Check out our guides to hiking boots or if you should wear hiking boots or trail runners for more.) Salomon REI (Men's) REI (Women's) Backcountry (Men's) Backcountry (Women's) If you’re recently been scouting for the best running shoes for trail, chances are you’ll have stumbled across gravel shoes. You’d be forgiven for wondering what they are. Gravel running shoes are basically hybrid running shoes built to handle multiterrain runs. They’re designed to let you run off-road—just not too far off the beaten track and certainly not onto the trickiest mountain slopes. The big selling point: They’re versatile enough to cruise compacted gravel (of course), forest tracks, hard-packed park and river paths, light uneven trails, and even the road commute to get there. “Gravel is a fairly new category,” says Taylor Bodin, chief trail shoe tester for Believe in the Run . “It is meant to be versatile in the sense that it can traverse lighter terrain more efficiently. This could mean anything from a door-to-trail shoe to a light trail shoe.” Gravel shoes blend the technologies and design of road and trail, mixing some of the cushion, impact pr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/what-are-gravel-running-shoes/", "timestamp": 1765262813.206092}

Players walk clockwise in a circle. When the music stops, everyone sits in a chair. Big Tech is setting in motion its plans for the next gen of lead designers, engineers, AI chiefs, and even CEOs. In Cupertino, Apple execs with familiar faces are retiring or reducing responsibilities. Who’s in and who’s out? Well, chief operating officer Jeff Williams retired in November, and the speculation is that CEO Tim Cook could follow in the near term. Lisa Jackson, who has led Apple’s sustainability efforts since 2013, is now set to retire in January too. There’s also the squad of Apple staffers who have been lured away to work with OpenAI , notably Apple’s former chief design officer Jony Ive after his independent stint at LoveFrom . In 2024, Molly Anderson was named industrial design leader, heading up a team of mostly fresh faces. Others have gone to Meta, such as Apple’s VP of human interface design, Alan Dye, who just this week was poached to head up a new Reality Labs design studio. At Apple, he’s been replaced by longtime UI designer Stephen Lemay. Phew. In this swirl of shifting talent, John Ternus, who has worked for Apple since 2001, and served as SVP of hardware engineering for the last four years, reporting directly to Tim Cook, is emerging as the front-runner to succeed Cook as Apple CEO, reportedly as soon as next year. WIRED asked Apple for comment but didn’t hear back before publication. Alongside a steady drip of “leaks” on succession planning and Ternus’ position at the front of the pack, since 2023, Ternus has been given more prominence at product launch events. He announced the iPhone Air onstage this past September, and has appeared alongside other senior Apple leaders in press interviews and in-store Apple events. “I think they're testing to see what sentiment is like. Apple likes to control the narrative.

Here’s a test for infants: Show them a glass of water on a desk. Hide it behind a wooden board. Now move the board toward the glass. If the board keeps going past the glass, as if it weren’t there, are they surprised? Many 6-month-olds are, and by a year, almost all children have an intuitive notion of an object’s permanence, learned through observation. Now some artificial intelligence models do too. Researchers have developed an AI system that learns about the world via videos and demonstrates a notion of “surprise” when presented with information that goes against the knowledge it has gleaned. The model, created by Meta and called Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), does not make any assumptions about the physics of the world contained in the videos. Nonetheless, it can begin to make sense of how the world works. “Their claims are, a priori, very plausible, and the results are super interesting,” says Micha Heilbron , a cognitive scientist at the University of Amsterdam who studies how brains and artificial systems make sense of the world. As the engineers who build self-driving cars know, it can be hard to get an AI system to reliably make sense of what it sees. Most systems designed to “understand” videos in order to either classify their content (“a person playing tennis,” for example) or identify the contours of an object—say, a car up ahead—work in what’s called “pixel space.” The model essentially treats every pixel in a video as equal in importance. But these pixel-space models come with limitations. Imagine trying to make sense of a suburban street. If the scene has cars, traffic lights and trees, the model might focus too much on irrelevant details such as the motion of the leaves. It might miss the color of the traffic light, or the positions of nearby cars. “When you go to images or video, you don’t want to work in [pixel] space because there are too many details you d", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-one-ai-model-creates-a-physical-intuition-of-its-environment/", "timestamp": 1765262813.4305444}

Probably no one save for director Roar Uthaug (2018's Tomb Raider ) had \"Norwegian kaiju\" down as an emerging genre, but this follow-up to 2022's original Troll makes a case for its improbable existence. Years after dealing with one rampaging titan unearthed from Norway's depths, paleontologist Nora Tidemann (Ine Marie Wilmann) is living in seclusion researching the creatures—until the government needs her advice on the hibernating \"Megatroll\" it has locked away. Soon, Nora—reunited with allies Andreas Isaksen (Kim Falck) and Major Kris Holm (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen)—is caught in another desperate race to prevent a trollpocalypse. This time though, there's an edge of Indiana Jones at work, with a madcap ancient conspiracy to decode alongside the troll-smashing action. Troll 2 is a bit more tongue-in-cheek than its predecessor, and ventures into so-bad-it's-good territory in places, but it knows exactly what it is and what it's offering: giant rock monsters beating the boulders off of each other.

You could take all of your games with you, install mods and custom software, or even plug into a hub and get some work done. Lenovo is taking another swing at the Windows handheld game with the Legion Go 2, undeterred by mixed reviews on the original Legion Go and streamlined Legion Go S . But even a snappier interface and versatile input methods can’t overcome a lot of the barriers inherent to running Windows on a device with no keyboard. If you’re willing to put in the work, or you already love your original Legion Go, the performance, screen, and software support have all improved. If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want to spend the time troubleshooting to dial in your experience, I’d recommend picking something a little lower maintenance. I was initially confused by the controllers, which are absolutely covered in buttons. Having a mouse is super helpful during Windows setup, and I repeatedly tried to figure out how I was intended to click the marked mouse buttons on the side of the controller while using the trackpad, only to later discover those aren't used in handheld mode. It turns out the touchpad is tap-to-click only, which is a little awkward. The left joystick already controls the cursor, and there's no obvious button for left click on your right hand. Lenovo Go Gen 2 Rating: 7/10 Speaking of cursors, the right controller has an optical sensor on the bottom so you can use it as a mouse, which Lenovo calls FPS mode in the settings. It’s unique, and the easy access to a mouse and right-click without using the touchpad is a nice bonus, but the way you grip the controller means you're always kind of palming the joystick on the side.

During the summer of 2025, Iran experienced an exceptional heat wave, with daytime temperatures across several regions, including Tehran, approaching 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) and forcing the temporary closure of public offices and banks. During this period, major reservoirs supplying the Tehran region reached record-low levels, and water supply systems came under acute strain . By early November, the reservoir behind Amir Kabir Dam, a main source of drinking water for Tehran, had dropped to about 8 percent of its capacity . The present crisis reflects not only this summer’s extreme heat but also several consecutive years of reduced precipitation and ongoing drought conditions across Iran. As a result, the capital of Iran is now facing a potential “Day Zero” when taps could run dry. The drought quickly disrupted Tehran’s urban systems. With dry soils and high evaporation, rivers and wetlands shrank . Falling reservoir levels led to disruptions in hydropower generation , and water shortages prompted strict saving measures across parts of the capital. Amid these escalating pressures, officials warned that the capital city may even have to be evacuated if water supplies fail to recover. In November, President Masoud Pezeshkian said the capital would have to be moved . These cascading impacts exposed how vulnerable Tehran’s infrastructure, economy, and communities have become under compounding heat and drought stress. These cascading impacts stem from a prolonged shortage of precipitation in recent years (Figure 1a). Precipitation around Tehran typically peaks between December and April, replenishing reservoirs behind dams before the onset of the dry summer. Over the past five years, precipitation during this wet period has remained consistently below the long-term climatological baseline, with the 2024-25 season showing the most pronounce", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/why-tehran-is-running-out-of-water-iran-climate-change-drought-extreme-weather/", "timestamp": 1765262813.916942}

Its device—revolutionary at the time—deflects rotational impact away from the head in the event of a crash, thereby reducing the likelihood of brain trauma. However, it has also provoked many companies to research and develop their own proprietary rotational impact protection units, most of which are different takes on the same concept —a snug inner webbing that is able to move independently of the helmet's outer shell. British brand RLS took a new stance on rotational impact protection, moving its device from the inside of the helmet to the outside. In doing so, the company claims that its technology can reduce the risk of concussion by four times when compared to traditional helmets. Studies at the standard-bearing helmet-safety lab at Virginia Tech University have confirmed those claims, giving the new Canyon Deflectr RLS—the first commercial helmet available with RLS—their highest rating after recent testing. Like any other new technology brand, RLS is hardly new . Its founders and earliest employees spent years toiling in a series of warehouse bays in East London, trying to find a way to better protect against rotational impact. Like all great origin stories, it wasn’t until the eleventh hour, when the brand was nearly out of seed money, that the company decided to try something new and potentially revolutionary: polycarbonate ball bearings. Canyon Deflectr RLS Helmet Rating: 9/10 RLS engineers fastened hundreds of the tiny bearings to adhesive strips, which they then stuck to the outer shells of helmets. Those strips were then covered in another layer of hard helmet shell. Et voila! The idea behind RLS technology is that when the helmet impacts a hard surface, the ball bearings roll off the strip, forcing the outer layer to shear away from the helmet. Those outer layers release, hence the company’s name, RLS, or “Relea", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/canyon-deflectr-rls-bike-helmet/", "timestamp": 1765262814.0272615}

Horses ’ storytelling is clumsy, and its blasé treatment of the sexual assaults (plural!) depicted in the game fails to elevate the game beyond more than a lazy commentary of sexual repression. It’s difficult to untangle the circumstances and controversy surrounding the game’s release from the content of the game itself. As a writer, I think censorship of creative work is Bad. I think Horses has as much right to exist as any other game, and that the power of distribution platforms to ban and delist a game by a small studio should be a concern for everyone. But the real problem with Horses is not that it’s too audacious for what is clearly intended to be an adult audience. Horses , for all the attention around its banning, is tedious and overreliant on pseudo-intellectual ideas. It confuses its own pretension for something profound. Even its shock value eventually wears off, making its three-hour run time feel like a slog. Conversations about whether or not it deserves the scandal are ultimately useless and wholly subjective.

Sure, it’s easy to rattle off some killer titles— KPop Demon Hunters , Stranger Things —but Netflix has never really had a brand identity. It’s not, like Disney , the home of Star Wars and Mickey Mouse. As streaming services go, it’s made its name by being a jack of all trades and a master of none. Now, it’s made its smartest move yet, dropping $83 billion to buy itself a whole new personality. On Friday, the streaming giant announced it will be acquiring Warner Bros. in a deal that gives Netflix the studio’s film and television operations as well as HBO and HBO Max. For those who can’t keep up with who owns what these days—no one can—that means that once the deal closes, Netflix will own everything from Batman to The Big Bang Theory , The Wizard of Oz to Westeros . Also, Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter , and prestige TV shows like The Sopranos. According to Paul Erickson, a media and entertainment analyst at Omdia, acquiring content with that kind of name recognition will allow Netflix to attract and retain subscribers. “It will also increase Netflix’s standing within the industry from talent, recruitment, and salary negotiation perspectives,” he added. The deal, which is expected to close next fall after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable business (CNN, HGTV, Discovery, and others), surprised the hell out of Hollywood when Netflix announced it Friday morning. Warner Bros. Discovery’s future had been hanging in the balance for weeks, with a series of potential buyers putting in offers. NBCUniversal parent company Comcast made a bid. So did Paramount Skydance—which worried some, given that the merger of Paramount and Skydance, headed up by Oracle founder Larry Ellison’s son David Ellison , became a political football involving everything from South Park to The Late Show With Stephen Colbert , which got put on ice this summer.

But the fabric-covered headboard is gorgeous, and the frame is sturdy. My favorite part is the drawer cleverly concealed at the foot of the frame, with its two partitions and its magnetic closure. It does feel a little jarring if you open and close the drawer while your partner is in bed, but I like having extra storage in my room, especially since this frame is too low to the ground to allow for stashing things under it. Silk & Snow S&S Organic Mattress The S&S Organic Mattress is the best organic latex mattress . It's very soft and offers a lot of pressure relief and support, but the responsive material means it's better suited to solo sleepers than it is to couples. It feels like a soft, dense marshmallow, per our sleep reviewer Julia Forbes , who advises using lightweight blankets and cooling sheets if you're a hot sleeper and also raved about the lengthy year-long sleep trial.

It's why you should always have lube within reach . Lube is a sexually active person’s best friend. Not only does it help prevent friction during penetration—vaginal and anal—which can lead to micro-tears and chafing, making one susceptible to possible infections, but it can be an incredible asset when giving oral sex or if you need some slippery touches during foreplay.

To make the right choice for your sex life, your lifestyle, and even your sex toys, it’s paramount to have an understanding of each. Water-based lubes are by far the most common because of their compatibility with silicone toys and latex condoms. These lubes also tend to be the most affordable—they’re water-based, after all—so you’re going to find them both online and in sex shops easily. High-quality water-based lubes may as well be called aloe-based lubes because Aloe barbadensis leaf gel is the primary thickener in almost all of them.

Fashion has been her obsession since she was a Syracuse high schooler inhaling spreads in Seventeen and hanging out in local malls. So she felt well-positioned to create a company for customers to discover the perfect garments using AI. The reality was much harder than she expected. I had breakfast recently with Bornstein and her CTO, Maria Belousova, to learn about her startup, Daydream , funded with $50 million from VCs like Google Ventures. The conversation took an unexpected turn as the women schooled me on the surprising difficulty of translating the magic of AI systems into something people actually find useful.T Her story helps explain something. My first newsletter of 2025 announced that it would be The Year of the AI App . Though there are indeed many such apps, they haven’t transformed the world as I anticipated. Ever since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, people have been blown away by the tricks performed by AI, but study after study has shown that the technology has not yet delivered a significant boost in productivity. (One exception: coding.) A study published in August found that 19 out of 20 AI enterprise pilot projects delivered no measurable value. I do think that productivity boost is on the horizon, but it’s taking longer than people expected. Listening to the stories of startups like Daydream that are pushing to break through gives some hope that persistence and patience might indeed make those breakthroughs happen. Bornstein’s original pitch to VCs seemed obvious: Use AI to solve tricky fashion problems by matching customers with the perfect garments, which they’d be delighted to pay for.

At least, in appearance it does. Resting on its kickstand outside my garage, the GoTrax Mustang looks as if it’s ready to play a role in the new season of Stranger Things. However, while it boasts imposing size and plenty of heft, the Mustang, the newest offering from Dallas-based GoTrax , is surprisingly nimble and easy to operate, owing in large part to its relatively short wheelbase. As soon as you start turning the pedals, it’s easy to forget that it’s a bicycle basically built on a moped platform. Before we get into the personality of this bike, let’s lay out the specs. The Mustang is powered by a 750-watt motor nestled into the bike’s rear hub, which can deliver up to 90 newton-meters of torque to its wheel. If you aren’t versed in torque ratings , rest assured that 90 Nm is more than enough to get me, a 6’ 4”, 255-pound bike commuter, up a hill near my home that averages a 4 percent gradient, with incline pitches over 15 percent. In other words—or, I guess in Waylon Jennings’ words—90 Nm flattens the hills. GoTrax Mustang Electric Bike Rating: 6/10 All of that is powered by a 48-volt, 15-Ah LG battery that, according to the company, offers up to 86 miles per change (more on that in a minute), charges from dead to full in fewer than two hours (by my watch), and boasts a UL 2272 safety certification , which will help you sleep better at night. Of course, all of that weight and power needs to stop, which is why the Mustang comes with Tektro hydraulic brakes mated to a pair of massive 180-mm disc-brake rotors. Again, take that hill I have to climb up to my office—reverse it for my commute home, and imagine all 255 pounds of me plus the 50-plus pounds of the bike itself bombing down –15 percent grades.

Throw in Gattaca , The Matrix , and Her and you’re presented with a fairly certain conclusion that the technology is making things worse, not better. Alas, technocrats keep grinding away at products that aim to increase your quality of life by a few percentage points by cutting out friction and inconvenience. ZIRP-era luminaries “solved” problems like last-mile transit, the need for pesky humans to operate taxis, and the lack of true market influence on housing costs. And with liquid full-meal replacement products, they even solved the problem of cooking and chewing food!

But those posts may trigger a Reddit moderator’s annoyance for a different reason—they are common themes within a growing genre of AI -generated, fake posts.

The ultimate passive aerobic exercise, sauna time can increase heart rate, body temperature, and cardiac output and provide benefits similar to moderate exercise –all by sitting in the heat and trying not to make eye contact with the stranger across the way. But how long should you stay in a sauna? This depends on the type of sauna, its temperature, your fitness levels, overall health, and how well hydrated you are. Take it easy and know your limits, suggest the experts. Vital+ Vital+ A sauna can be a treat for those that love the heat and a challenging endurance test for those that don’t. “In my experience, the benefits of the traditional Finnish sauna are profound,” says Michal Cohen-Sagi, founder of longevity and biohacking circuit Vidavii . “It’s one of the simplest and most powerful longevity practices that is deeply rooted in ancient tradition and easily accessible in the modern day. Regular sauna use can improve circulation and strengthen cardiovascular function. Some suggest that it can even help with reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s .” A contrast therapy session is a great way to make the most of a sauna session in short bursts. “Contrast therapy is a combination of hot and cold exposure, whereby you might move from a sauna into a cryotherapy chamber or a cold plunge ,” says Cohen-Sagi. “This intense shift in temperature trains your blood vessels to contract and dilate efficiently, boosting circulation, reducing inflammation, and improving resilience. It’s an incredible way to wake up the body’s natural healing systems and brain clarity and a kind of a reset.” How long you spend in a sauna, or any kind of hot or cold therapy, depends on your fitness level and your overall health. “The fitter you are—and that doesn’t just mean strength—you will likely be able to better handle the heat,” says Puck Alkemade, a researcher and physiologist with CORE , who has devel", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-long-should-you-stay-in-a-sauna/", "timestamp": 1765262815.7701535}

Multiple websites—including MagicEdit and DreamPal—all appeared to be using the same unsecured database, says security researcher Jeremiah Fowler, who discovered the security flaw in October. At the time, Fowler says, around 10,000 new images were being added to the database every day. Indicating how people may have been using the image-generation and editing tools, these images included “unaltered” photos of real people who may have been nonconsensually “ nudified, ” or had their faces swapped onto other, naked bodies. “The real issue is just innocent people, and especially underage people, having their images used without their consent to make sexual content,” says Fowler, a prolific hunter of exposed databases, who published the findings on the ExpressVPN blog . Fowler says it is the third misconfigured AI-image-generation database he has found accessible online this year—with all of them appearing to contain nonconsensual explicit imagery, including those of young people and children. Fowler’s findings come as AI-image-generation tools continue to be used to maliciously create explicit imagery of people. An enormous ecosystem of “nudify” services, which are used by millions of people and make millions of dollars per year , uses AI to “strip” the clothes off of people—almost entirely women—in photos.

The outside general counsel for USIP, he’s been part of the effort to keep the US government from seizing control of the organization. When DOGE operatives arrived at the USIP offices in the spring they came in like a “strike team,” Foote told the audience at WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday in San Francisco. The DOGE team, Foote said, left behind a “half-pound of weed”—more probably, a fellow panelist noted, a half-ounce—and ultimately seemed to have “no idea what to do with the place.” It was, Foote said, indicative of a lot of the work of DOGE, which “arrived as the brass knuckles on an authoritarian fist.” He added that he wasn’t sure what Musk wanted to do with DOGE, “but he took it to a destructive level.” The Trump administration’s interest in the independent agency dates back to a February 19 executive order declaring the agency “unnecessary” and calling for it to be eliminated. In March, the administration fired the 10 voting board members of the USIP, and according to court filings , tried to enter the headquarters but were turned away. In court documents, lawyers for the agency detailed a series of attempts by DOGE to enter the $500 million building before its operatives eventually succeeded. Ultimately, a judge ruled that DOGE and the US government didn’t have the right to take control of USIP and its headquarters. Still, this week Trump’s name was installed on the headquarters of USIP ahead of the signing of a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the building. The signing was “held there because the president wants to assert control over the building,” said Foote, who is currently representing USIP directors in a lawsuit challenging Trump’s right to remove them from office.

Boomers, Hogg said, are likely the group most out of touch with their generation in Washington, DC. “You know why I say that?” Hogg said. “It's because the people that are marching by the millions right now in the No Kings Day protests are not young people. They are people of Chuck Schumer's generation that are extremely pissed off with him.” Hogg’s Schumer slams weren’t the only anti-boomer jabs he threw during his talk, likening the current makeup of Congress to the “end of the Soviet Union” when he said “leaders were dying over and over because they were so old,” and complaining about the establishment leadership in the Democratic National Committee , where Hogg was vice chair until a recent shake-up. While Hogg did concede that “there are plenty of great boomers out there,” he said part of what he’s working on as the cofounder of the group Leaders We Deserve is a shift in elected officials’ age and political focus. “What we want to do with Leaders We Deserve is not just elect younger versions of who's already there,” said Hogg. “We want to elect younger people that have the chance to actually have integrity, support them with millions of dollars, ensure that they don't take money from corporations, for example, [and ask] th", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-event-david-hogg/", "timestamp": 1765262816.5549822}

At WIRED’s Big Interview event, Techdirt editor Mike Masnick and Common Tools CEO Alex Komoroske announced a manifesto designed to help the industry get back on track.", "content": "Alex Komoroske has always been at odds with Big Tech’s darker side. Though he cut his product-management teeth at Google and Stripe , he was never comfortable with the industry’s increasing prioritization of profits over people. Once during his time at Google, he extolled the societal benefits of a project only to be met with, “Oh Alex, you'd be a VP by now if you just stopped thinking through the implications of your actions.” Since that 2010s episode, the revenues and valuations in tech have skyrocketed, as has the blithe disregard for users. “It’s disgusting to see the industry as it currently is,” Komoroske says. Now, he’s doing something about it. Today, Komoroske and a loose group of concerned technologists are releasing The Resonant Computing Manifesto , an idealistic set of principles that attempts to recenter Silicon Valley around the values that have been lost in the scramble to hyperscale and maximize shareholder value. Komoroske and his coauthors are inviting anyone who, um, resonates with this jeremiad to sign it and proselytize those values in the products they create. Accompanying the manifesto is a shared doc of “the theses of resonant computing” where the community itself can provide input on shared principles. (Think: Martin Luther with a Google Workspace account.) “There are a lot of us who remember a Silicon Valley, a world of innovation, where we felt good,” Techdirt founder Mike Masnick, a coauthor of the manifesto, said during WIRED’s Big Interview event on Thursday during a panel announcing the manifesto. “A lot of us have noticed that we don’t get that feeling anymore.” Komoroske followed that up by saying that the manifesto is a response to cynicism, and that the values in it are ideals people in the Valley want to follow, even if it may not seem so on the surface. The idea for the manifesto emerged from an informal “think tank,” as Komoroske calls it, of technologists concerned about the state of Silicon Valley.

It also needs to make its software more usable. The way to do all that appears to be hiring design maestros away from Apple.", "content": "Meta has made a big move to hire two prominent designers away from rival tech giant Apple , likely putting them to work on designing Meta’s next generation of AI hardware and the software that runs on it. Alan Dye, formerly Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design, will join Meta to head up a new design studio within Meta’s Reality Labs. Billy Sorrentino, a senior director on Apple’s design team (and former WIRED creative director ) will also join Meta’s Reality Labs. In a post on the Meta platform Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the two would lead the new studio and “bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences.” In his own Instagram post, Sorrentino confirmed the news . (In response to a request for comment from WIRED, a Meta rep pointed toward the Threads posts by Zuckerberg and Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth .) Dye has long been a prominent figure in Apple’s design team, leading big pushes like watchOS, the Apple Vision Pro, and the somewhat controversial Liquid Glass redesign of iOS 26, which designers called beautiful but “ hard to read .” His switch to Meta telegraphs a hunger from the Zuckerberg-run company to re-create Apple’s dominance in interaction design, even if it has also caused some people to joke about what the Liquid Glass guy will do to Meta’s design interface. Anshel Sag, a tech analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, says that above anything else, the move telegraphs a move by Meta to fix its often stodgy and unappealing user interface across its platforms. “Meta has always been a software nightmare,” Sag says. “There’s a lot of inconsistency across all of Meta’s software platforms. Facebook, Insta, WhatsApp, Quest—they have not had the highest standards of quality. That’s especially true of the user interface. If they want users to stay on their platform, they’re going to have to fix the UI.” The move comes as Meta continues to go absolutely all in on its AI efforts.

To facilitate this transition, Circle is creating what Allaire calls an “economic OS for the internet.” “Basically, there are new operating system paradigms that emerge all the time. The web is one, mobile is one, cloud is another, AI is another OS paradigm,” Allaire told WIRED’s editor at large, Steven Levy, onstage at the Big Interview event in San Francisco on Thursday. “And these blockchain networks are economic OS paradigms, at least what we're doing.” Circle is best known for USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is currently worth around $78 billion. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stablecoins are designed to have limited price fluctuations. USDC is backed by the US dollar, meaning if you own one USDC, you can exchange it for $1. Allaire touted USDC and stablecoins broadly as a better, faster way to transfer money across borders, and an attractive option for people who live in countries with less stable currencies than the US dollar. But according to Allaire, stablecoins are just the beginning. The next evolution in the cryptocurrency space, he said, is “money as an app platform,” on which a new, digital-only economy will grow. Circle’s vision for an “economic OS” is Arc , what the company describes as a “trusted, neutral” platform that aims to be critical infrastructure for the entire swath of blockchain-based technologies and, thus, the “foundation” of a “new internet financial system.” According to Allaire, the transition to this new economic system “is going to be a huge part of what unfolds for the internet over the next five to 10 years.” Central to Circle’s efforts is functional government regulation.

Lavingia joined the IRS in November. In a conversation at WIRED’s Big Interview event with former acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration Leland Dudek and David Foote, outside counsel for the US Institute of Peace, Lavingia said, “I'm working at IRS for online accounts.” Lavingia said that he joined as a career employee after Sam Corcos, a DOGE operative and the chief information officer of the Treasury Department, reached out to him after reading an article he'd written about his experience in government, offering to put him in touch with people who could help him find a role in which he could put his talents to use as a federal worker. When he asked the Big Interview crowd whether the IRS should have a mobile app, attendees enthusiastically said it should. Lavingia was previously assigned to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), where he was part of a group of technologists brought into the government in the early months of DOGE’s takeover. In 2015, he had applied to be a part of the US Digital Service (USDS), now the US DOGE Service . Like many DOGE technologists, he had no previous experience in government or in the specialized work of the agency to which he was assigned; he is the founder and CEO of Gumroad, a platform where creatives can sell their work. At the VA, Lavignia attempted to use an AI tool to write code for the agency’s systems and suggested the agency move away from paper forms entirely. He built a tool to “munch” data about the agency’s contracts to identify those that could be cut. He was fired from his role at the VA in May after he spoke to a reporter about his work at DOGE.

He loves expressing himself through creativity, whether fashion , performance, or conversation. He sees each day as a stage and treats ordinary moments with the same energy he brings to a film set. This energy shapes every aspect of his life. Ranveer ’s fashion isn’t just clothing; it’s storytelling. His outfits can go from neon jackets to vintage-inspired suits, showing his motto that fashion should break norms. He chooses clothes based on his emotional personality, not because of trends. For him, clothes are a medium to express moods, celebrate personality, and challenge monotony. Despite his loud public image, Ranveer has quiet habits that make him creative . He spends mornings reading scripts, listening to old music, or noting ideas in notebooks. These private rituals help him center his energy and prepare for demanding roles. He believes creativity grows when nurtured through daily intentional practices. Ranveer watches films not just for entertainment but also as a learning experience. He analyzes performances, music cues, and camera choices. Friends say he often rewatches classics late at night, studying them like textbooks. This devotion to cinema explains the depth and range he brings to characters on screen. His relationship with Deepika Padukone brings balance to his otherwise high-voltage life. They create a space of calm at home reading together, cooking simple meals, or taking silent walks. Deepika’s grounded presence helps him regulate his intense energy while he adds color to her life. Ranveer is known for celebrating the ordinary. A cup of chai, a new song discovery, or a fan interaction excites him. He believes happiness hides in simple moments, and acknowledging them keeps life vibrant. This mindset fuels his optimism, making him one of the most naturally joyful personalities in Bollywood. He treats each film as a personal pilgrimage.

Ever since the release of the high-stakes movie on Friday, December 5, the track has been the most-discussed aspect of the movie. While the song is touted as Akshaye’s “entry song”. It is not exactly his entry in the film. The song happens when a rebel gang in Balochistan welcomes Akshaye Khanna . The viral track is titled FA9LA, a Bahranian song, written and performed by Flipperachi and Daffy, and composed by DJ Outlaw. The viral track from Dhurandhar , featuring Akshaye Khanna, is a hip-hop track in the distinct Khaleeji style. Sung in the Bahraini dialect, FA9LA means “fun time” or “party,” according to media reports. The “party” mode of the viral track may seem in contrast to Akshaye Khanna's vile character, Rehman Dakait, in Dhurandhar on the surface level. But Fa9la actually captures the Rehman Dakait to the core — he was someone who loved bloodshed and relished gory kills. For the infamous gangster, brutal killings were fun and a party. Hussam Aseem aka Flipperachi, the Bahraini rapper behind the viral song, is one of the most promising young voices in Arab hip-hop. According to media reports, citing his profile on LastFM, Aseem discovered his passion for music at 12 and developed his rap style as a teenager. In 2003, he began his professional career. Over the years, the rapper has collaborated with artists from around the world and won the Bahraini Artist of the Year award in 2024. Some of Flipperachi's biggest hits include Ee Laa, Shino AlKalam Hatha, Shoofha and Nayda. The aggressive beats, heavy bass and Arabic trap style of Fa9la has helped Akshaye Khanna's character to get an instant larger-than-life personality.

However, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Hyderabad airport witnessed more than 200 flight disruptions on Tuesday. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued a fresh notice to IndiGo announcing reduction of 5% of flight operations as a penalty to its inability to operate planned schedules. This comes after DGCA issued a show cause notice to the airline on 6 December over large-scale operational disruptions and observed non-compliances and gave it time till 6:00 PM Monday to file a response, However, the airline requested more time to respond and said it is \"realistically not possible to pinpoint the exact cause(s)\" at this time, considering the “complexity and vast scale of operations.” As flight fares skyrocketed after massive cancellations, the government instructed airlines to cap air fares. \"Airfare has been capped at ₹ 18,000.

Speaking in a meeting at the White House, Trump expressed interest to introduce new tariffs on agricultural imports, particularly Indian rice and fertilizer from Canada. The US President's comments come at a time when farmers, his key support base, are faced with increasing costs and market challenges linked to tariff policies. Trump unveiled a $12 billion fresh aid for US farmers amid complaints that cheaper imports were making it difficult for their products to compete in the US markets. Trump, however, did not make it clear how much US tariffs will be imposed on Indian rice imports. India already pays 50% Trump tariffs on its goods, which were imposed in August as a punishment for its continued oil trade with Russia despite the Ukraine war.  “Why is India allowed to do that (dumping rice into the US)? They have to pay tariffs. Do they have an exemption on rice,” the US President asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. To this, Bessent replied, “No, sir. We're still working on their trade deal.” Trump said he would “take care” of alleged dumping of Indian rice into the US. Farmers have pointed to falling rice prices, claiming imports from countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand are undercutting their crops. “They shouldn't be dumping,” Trump said. “I mean, I heard that, I heard that from others. You can't do that.”  While India pays 50% Trump tariffs on its exports to the US already, the new duties could mean more pressure ahead. Indian officials are continuing their trade talks with their counterparts in the US, but no major breakthrough has been achieved so far.

He was 92. His niece, Susan Tremblay, told the NYT that the cause of Wilford's death was prostate cancer. John Wilford gave the NYT readers an awe-inspiring and comprehensive account of Apollo 11’s touchdown and exploratory mission on the moon’s arid Sea of Tranquillity under the front-page banner headline “MEN WALK ON MOON,” on 21 July 1969. “It was man’s first landing on another world,” he wrote, “the realisation of centuries of dreams, the fulfillment of a decade of striving, a triumph of modern technology and personal courage, the most dramatic demonstration of what man can do if he applies his mind and resources with single-minded determination.” He added: “The moon, long the symbol of the impossible and the inaccessible, was now within man’s reach, the first port of call in this new age of spacefaring.” John Wilford, a Kentucky-born journalist, worked at The Wall Street Journal and Time magazine before joining The Times in late 1965. He, according to the NYT, combined a passion for scholarship with a detective’s eye for detail and the literary skills of a master storyteller. Wilford's journalism career spanned six decades, coinciding with milestone discoveries in the mysteries of dinosaurs and early human life, as well as in space exploration. In 1965, Wilford was assigned his first major assignment for which he won a Times in-house publisher’s award — coverage of a maneuver by four astronauts on two spacecraft, Gemini 6 and Gemini 7. He called it “man’s first rendezvous in the vastness of outer space.” John Wilford's assignments led to several books, starting with “We Reach the Moon,” about America’s space program.

The tremor struck at 2:55 PM (local time) with an initial magnitude of 2.9, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The earthquake originated about 2.85 miles deep, with the epicentre situated just north of Montclair. According to a report by SFGATE, the series of earthquakes around San Ramon carried on into Monday afternoon, following at least seven tremors earlier in the day. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, two additional small quakes hit the area—one registering a preliminary magnitude of 2.9 at 1:50 p.m., and another measuring 2.6 at 1:59 p.m. UC Berkeley seismologist Roland Burgmann told SFGATE that Monday morning's earthquakes in San Ramon represent a “flare-up” of last month’s swarm, which produced around 90 small quakes in November. He explained that this type of activity is typical for the San Ramon and Alamo area, which has seen roughly a dozen similar swarms over the past two to two-and-a-half decades.  “These are a little bit different from earthquakes that we usually see, where commonly we see a bigger event first and then you have smaller ones that are called aftershocks. This is different in the sense that they come and go for a while, they tend to never get very big,” he told SFGATE.

The decision, disclosed by President Trump on his Truth Social platform amounts to a strategic shift in Washington DC’s management of the technological rivalry between the world’s two largest economies. Under the arrangement, Nvidia may ship H200 processors to China on the condition that the US government receives a 25% surcharge. According to a Commerce Department official cited by Bloomberg , this payment will be collected as the chips move from Taiwanese manufacturing facilities to the United States , where they will undergo security inspection by the Bureau of Industry and Security before re-export. Trump argued publicly that the plan would “protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” while also insisting that more advanced systems—Nvidia’s Blackwell and Rubin families—are excluded from the deal. This framework represents a notable departure from the blanket restrictions introduced in 2022 to deny Beijing access to the most sophisticated American AI hardware. It also builds on an earlier, unrealised proposal under which Nvidia and AMD would remit 15% of revenue from China chip sales to the US Treasury. According to Bloomberg , officials had been weighing the H200 decision for weeks. The final compromise reflects both political calculus and strategic pragmatism. Nvidia had lobbied for access to China to recover what Chief Executive Jensen Huang described as a US$50 billion market opportunity, while lawmakers struggled to balance commercial interests with national-security imperatives.

This modification applies to specific groups of immigrants residing in the United States, including some individuals in the process of seeking permanent residency. However, the change is expected to affect those moving through the green card application process. Since December 5, USCIS has restricted the length of both new and renewal of EADs to a maximum of 18 months. Anyone who received an EAD before that date will keep the full validity originally granted, but when they apply for a renewal in the future, the updated 18-month limit will apply, according to a report by Newsweek.  According to Business Insider, these changes may lead to more frequent EAD renewals, which means additional filing fees, extra paperwork, and a heightened risk of employment interruptions if USCIS processing times stay slow. This could directly affect the job stability of green card applicants. To prepare, green card applicants—particularly those relying on an EAD while their adjustment of status is pending—should: 1. Submit their EAD renewal applications as early as possible; USCIS permits filing up to 180 days before expiration. 2. Organise all required documents in advance, such as their passport, I-485 receipt notice, and current EAD, and ensure their USCIS records are accurate. 3. Plan financially for potentially more frequent renewal fees. As of the time of publication, renewals can cost up to $605, though discounted rates are available for adjustment-of-status applicants. 4.

The recent takeover of areas in Hadhramaut province by the Southern Transitional Council reflects a rift in forces aligned against the Houthi rebels who have taken most of the country’s north, including the capital, Sanaa. Since 2014, Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war pitting the Iranian-backed Houthis against an internationally recognized government, which is supported by a Saudi-led military coalition. The separatist Southern Transitional Council is part of the anti-Houthi camp, but it seeks an independent state in southern Yemen. A Yemeni government official said Monday that the Saudi-led coalition had withheld permission for flights, including those to and from the southern city of Aden , the seat of the internationally recognized government. The official described the move as a “Saudi message” to the separatists, following their latest takeover of areas in the sprawling oil-rich province of Hadhramaut, which borders Saudi Arabia. The escalation could lead to Yemen being split into two states after more than three decades of unification. Saudi Arabia didn’t acknowledge closing Yemen’s airspace on Monday. Since the entry of a Saudi-led coalition into Yemen’s war in 2015, the coalition has controlled the country’s airspace.

The victim, Michael Virgil, aged 35, died in December 2024 while in custody aboard the ship, the lawsuit claims. His family alleges that on the day he died, crew members continued serving him alcohol at one of the ship’s bars, despite what they describe as clearly disturbing behaviour. The lawsuit contends that this excessive serving directly contributed to his worsening condition. According to court filings — as reported by media outlets — Virgil was later detained onboard following what is described as a “drunken rage,” during which he allegedly threatened crew members and other passengers. It was after this confrontation that his condition worsened and a medical emergency ensued. Following an investigation, the cause of death has been officially ruled a homicide. The family’s wrongful death lawsuit holds Royal Caribbean and the ship’s staff responsible for the events leading up to Virgil’s death. They argue that the company failed in its duty of care by allowing the continued supply of alcohol, ignoring signs of intoxication and negligence in handling a vulnerable passenger. Officially, neither Royal Caribbean nor any of its representatives have responded publicly to the lawsuit (as of the date of this writing). The family’s attorneys, however, insist they will seek full accountability, including compensatory damages for emotional distress and loss, and punitive damages aimed at prompting stronger safety protocols for cruise passengers.

It also requests that a federal judge shield the Texas-based software developer from prosecution, alleging “unlawful threats made by Attorney General Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons, and White House Border Czar Tom Homan to criminally investigate and prosecute Aaron for his role in developing ICEBlock.” The Department of Justice did not immediately reply to AP's request for comment. ICEBlock was the most widely used ICE-tracking app on Apple’s app store until Bondi stated in October that her office had contacted Apple, “demanding that they remove ICEBlock\", asserting that it “is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Apple abided by the request soon after, sending Aaron an email stating it would prevent further downloads of the app because new information “provided to Apple by law enforcement” indicated the app violated the app store rules. As per the email, which Aaron shared with AP in October, Apple mentioned the app flouted the company’s policies “because its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group\". The Trump administration slammed ICEBlock and other apps that challenged its immigration policies.

Alina Habba had once served as the current US president's personal lawyer and was Trump's pick to serve as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. However, a little over a week back, a panel of three appellate judges with the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's finding that the Trump administration broke the law by using a series of manoeuvres to install Habba as US attorney for New Jersey after the 41-year-old failed to get the Senate's approval. That ruling led to Habba's resignation on Monday. In a lengthy statement posted on X, Habba detailed her reasons for stepping down. “For the past five years, I’ve fought for justice on behalf of the American people, and in my tenure under our great Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, we made New Jersey safer. Camden had its first murder-free summer in 50 years. We drove down crime, took violent offenders off the streets, caught terrorists, and put away child predators,” Habba wrote, highlighting the Trump administration's achievements in the city. The 41-year-old lawyer went on to say that while she was focusing on delivering real results, judges in New Jersey “took advantage of a flawed blue slip tradition and became weapons for the politicized left”. “For months, these judges stopped conducting trials and entering sentences, leaving violent criminals on the streets. They joined New Jersey senators, who care more about fighting President Trump than the well being of residents which they serve,” Habba explained. Trump's former lawyer further said that she was relinquishing the post and stepping down “to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love.” “But do not mistake compliance for surrender.

The move marks one of the most significant structural shifts for the brand in years, prompting questions about its future direction and long-term viability. Founded in 1953, Denny’s became legendary for its round-the-clock dining, comfort-food classics, and its role as a go-to stop for families, night-shift workers, students and travellers. The brand built a devoted following with dishes like the Grand Slam Breakfast, bottomless coffee , and its reliably open doors—even on holidays.  At its peak, the chain operated well over 2,000 restaurants nationwide. But shifting consumer habits, rising operating costs and increased competition from faster, cheaper breakfast outlets have steadily eroded its footprint. Much of Denny’s cultural staying power comes from the menu items that became synonymous with the brand. The Grand Slam Breakfast, introduced in the 1970s, remains its most iconic dish—an abundant plate of eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes designed to deliver classic American comfort. The chain is also known for its Moons Over My Hammy sandwich, a cult favourite packed with ham, scrambled eggs and Swiss cheese, as well as its signature Build Your Own Slam, which allowed customers to tailor their breakfast exactly how they wanted. Other staples—including the Chicken-Fried Steak, the Country-Fried Bacon, and stacks of syrupy buttermilk pancakes—helped define Denny’s as a place where indulgence, familiarity and value converged. Even its endless cups of coffee became a symbol of the brand, fuelling travellers through overnight drives and keeping night-shift workers company in the quiet early hours. As of early 2025, Denny’s operates approximately 1,445 locations across the United States , the majority of which are franchised.

State-run Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked transmission connectivity approvals for 6.3GW of green power capacity over delays in project development, Union minister of state for power Shripad Naik said on Monday. In a written reply to a query in Rajya Sabha, the minister said there were 16 petitions pending before the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) that pertain to cases where the power generators have approached the regulator seeking protection from revocation of connectivity. \"Since 2022, Central Transmission Utility of India Ltd (CTUIL) has revoked connectivity of 24 grantees with a renewable energy (RE) capacity of 6,343MW. The cancellations are on account of developer delays and not due to transmission side delays,\" the minister said. An Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for the evacuation of 172 GW of renewable energy is already under construction, and bids are in process for 19 GW capacity, he added.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set.

Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

But today, short-term study abroad programs are rapidly gaining traction among students. With changing academic schedules, tighter budgets, and the need for practical global exposure, more students are turning to shorter, more flexible international experiences. So, why is short-term study abroad popular —and is it the right choice for you? Let’s explore the benefits, opportunities, and growing demand behind this trend. Short-term study abroad typically refers to programs lasting anywhere from one to eight weeks. These may take place during summer, winter break, or spring break, and are often focused on a specific academic subject, cultural immersion, or service-learning project. They provide a condensed, intensive international experience—without the long-term commitment or high costs associated with traditional study abroad. There are several reasons why students are increasingly choosing short-term programs over semester-long stays: College students today often juggle internships, part-time jobs, and packed course loads. Short-term programs allow them to gain global exposure without falling behind academically or missing work opportunities at home. One of the biggest advantages of short-term study abroad programs is cost. They’re often significantly less expensive than semester-long programs, making them more accessible to a wider range of students. In today’s global job market, international experience is highly valued. Short programs focused on specific industries—like business, health care, or environmental science—can help students develop career-ready skills and stand out in competitive job applications. Even a few weeks abroad can offer deep cultural learning, language exposure, and the chance to build a global mindset—something highly desirable for employers and graduate programs alike.

This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence.

Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable.

Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential.

The answer is simple—studying culinary arts abroad gives you access to diverse cuisines, hands-on training with international chefs, and a rich cultural experience that shapes your culinary perspective. In today’s globalized kitchen, having international experience isn’t just impressive—it can significantly benefit your culinary career. Here’s why pursuing a culinary arts study abroad program is one of the smartest moves for aspiring chefs. One of the biggest benefits of culinary art schools abroad is the chance to study regional dishes right where they originated. Want to master French pastries, Thai street food, or Italian pasta? There’s no better place to learn than in France, Thailand, or Italy. Instead of reading about techniques or watching online tutorials, you’re getting first-hand training in the country’s food culture. That level of authenticity can’t be replicated in a classroom back home. When you study culinary arts abroad , you’re exposed to a variety of ingredients, preparation styles, and cultural traditions. This diverse knowledge not only enhances your creativity in the kitchen but also prepares you for a global culinary career. Your palate expands, your understanding of food deepens, and you gain the ability to blend techniques and flavors across borders. This is one of the best ways to develop a truly international approach to cooking. Employers in the culinary industry value candidates with international training. Why? Because it shows adaptability, independence, and a broader understanding of food and hospitality. Whether you want to work in five-star restaurants, open your own fusion restaurant, or become a culinary educator, international experience can set you apart. Simply put, how international experience can benefit your career is by opening doors that domestic education often can’t.

Whether you’re heading to Europe, Asia, or anywhere in between, living and learning in a new culture offers you the chance to build skills that last a lifetime. So, what skills do you gain from studying abroad ? Let’s explore the most valuable skills you can expect to develop—and why they matter long after your trip ends.  One of the most important skills you gain from studying abroad is the ability to adapt to new environments. From navigating unfamiliar cities to handling cultural differences, you learn to think on your feet and become more self-reliant. This kind of independence prepares you to handle future challenges in both personal and professional settings. What skills does studying abroad give you that truly stand out in the workplace? Cross-cultural communication is high on the list. When you study abroad, you interact with people from different backgrounds and learn to communicate across language barriers and cultural norms. This skill is essential in our increasingly globalized world and can give you a serious advantage in international careers. Being in a new country often means facing unexpected situations. Whether it’s figuring out public transport or resolving a housing issue, you’ll need to think critically and solve problems on the spot. These are exactly the kind of soft skills employers value—making them a crucial part of the list of skills from study abroad experiences. The process of stepping outside your comfort zone builds confidence. Overcoming homesickness, managing your own finances, or succeeding in a foreign classroom can all make you more resilient and self-assured. So if you’re wondering what skills you can get from study abroad, don’t overlook the personal growth that fuels both academic and career success. Naturally, studying abroad improves language skills —especially if you’re living in a country where a different language is spoken", "url": "https://www.studyabroad.com/blog/what-skills-do-you-gain-from-studying-abroad/", "timestamp": 1765262897.9253414}
