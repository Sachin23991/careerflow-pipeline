Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) .

The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

After school, I moved to Bengaluru for a BBA in Entrepreneurship at Jain University (CMS). The programme’s emphasis on creating meaningful work sparked my entrepreneurial spirit. During a 50-hour internship with Teach For India, I saw how rural children lacked exposure to global opportunities.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category. It sought a direction to the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education and School Federation of India Games to schedule the annual sports calendar (including all zonal, inter-zonal, state, and national tournaments, trials and coaching camps) for all outdoor sports in the capital during safer and less susceptible months with verifiably better ambient air quality.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764018856.9946873}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

When the timer starts, don’t dive in. Spend 120 seconds to see the terrain: question types, section spread, and obvious quick wins. Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean. Move fast; don’t wrestle. – Pass 2 (18–30 min): Come back to B-grade questions – doable with a little effort. Leave C-grade items – the long, novel, or word-heavy ones – unless time remains. If you can’t see a path in 30 seconds, tag it and move. Accuracy beats volume.

The total number of candidates who have received government jobs during the tenure of the present government has increased to 1,34,999, he said. The chief minister said that young men and women who received appointments today have achieved their goal after years of perseverance. ‘Getting a job without paying even a single rupee is a true achievement and this transparent system has opened the door to many competent youth of the state’, he said. Assam has talents in various fields, and if these talents are identified and nurtured through education, they can contribute greatly to society, he said. The task of advancing the public education system in the right direction is a major challenge, and before 2011, teacher recruitment in Assam was marred by political interference, Sarma claimed. In the recruitment of college teachers, nepotism prevailed, and appointments were made for political considerations and at times, two or three teachers were appointed against a single sanctioned post, he said. ‘Introducing Teacher Eligibility Tests (TET) in primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels in 2011 brought a reform in the recruitment system, but it faced political challenges during this reform process, but ultimately succeeded in ensuring merit-based recruitment in schools and colleges’, he said. If recruitment is not done on merit, the public education system will collapse, and Assam can never become one of the leading states of the country’, he added.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion. European and East Asian universities are also in negotiations,” he said. As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared. Recognising that reading lengthy passages on screens differs from paper, test-makers deliberately reduced passage lengths. Everything now fits on one screen, doing-away with the need for excessive scrolling. For years, XAT has carried a reputation for being one of the “toughest” MBA entrance examinations.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

With the implementation of GRAP Stage III, several restrictions have come into effect across the capital and adjoining regions. These include a ban on non-essential construction work, the closure of stone crushers and mining activities, and curbs on the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and neighbouring NCR districts.

Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1764018877.1828566}

The technology will also allow parents to stay regularly updated on their child’s academic progress, strengthening communication between schools and families, the statement stated.

From November 3, eligible tertiary and secondary school students are allowed to work up to 25 hours a week during their study period — an increase from the 20-hour limit. The higher work allowance applies to all new student visas granted from November 3, even if applications were submitted earlier. Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa. Most student visas already allow full-time work during summer and other scheduled breaks, and those with this condition can choose to apply for the extra five hours after summer if their visa remains valid. School students in years 12 and 13 will still require parental and school permission for in-study work rights, even with the increased weekly limit.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends.

The popular overseas education destinations among Indian students have been English-speaking countries such as the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, because of their quality of education, job prospects and friendly policies for foreign students. However, following elections in all these major destinations and a change in their national priorities, there have been some policy changes which has affected international students.

According to the 2024 data from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), there were around 1.3 million Indian students studying abroad. In 2025, the number has gone over 1.8 million, according to the latest data presented in the Rajya Sabha by the MEA, and is projected to rise in the coming years.

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts. To prevent delays, students are advised to apply 3 to 4 months before their travel date via the Consular Services Portal, ensuring all documentation — such as admission letters and a detailed statement of purpose—is complete. Germany’s medical qualification, the Staatsexamen is a six-year program conducted in German, requiring at least C1-level proficiency in the language.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra. Tracing algebra to Indian mathematicians, the chapter says: “In the 8th century, Indian mathematical ideas were translated into Arabic.

The Dutch regulator clarified in a statement on their website that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February. Bloomberg was first to report on RDW’s statement. “RDW and Tesla know what efforts need to be made to make a decision on this in February. Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads. Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times.

Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko , is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similiar: “ An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own .” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox , I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that the Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network.

AWS announced Monday it is investing $50 billion to build AI “high-performance computing infrastructure” purposefully built for the U.S. government. The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services. The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company. AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.

It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October. As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas) and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80 percent on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark. Anthropic also emphasized the Opus’s computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its Claude for Chrome and Claude for Excel products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team and Enterprise users. Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. “There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.” Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.

X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date. X-energy said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica. The new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures. X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity. Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers. Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund led the first installment of the startup’s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy more than 600 megawatts of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s.

In a tweet on Sunday, Kupor said that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.” Amy Gleason, who was named as the “official” acting administrator of DOGE earlier this year, posted on LinkedIn soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.” While active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. DOGE’s cuts have also been blamed for countless deaths across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of security lapses that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.

You can either create a playlist manually, or Pocket Casts can automatically create one for you. Playlists are designed to better personalize the listening experience for users as Pocket Casts seeks to grow its paid user base and compete with larger platforms. Currently, it has 60,000 subscribers, while Spotify has 281 million. The new feature makes it easy to curate collections based on specific topics and themes, or could be used to listen your favorite podcast guest featured across different shows. It’s also helpful for preparing a list of episodes to enjoy while on a long flight or during your daily commute. To get started creating a manual playlist, navigate to the Playlists tab on the main screen and select the “+” icon on a mobile device or “New playlist” on the web version. From there, you can browse through your favorite podcasts and handpick the episodes that you want to include in your personalized playlist. For those who prefer a more automated approach, Pocket Casts offers Smart Playlists. By selecting the “Smart rules” button, you can create custom rules that automatically gather episodes based on specific criteria. For example, if you only want to listen to shorter episodes, you can set a rule to only include shows under 25 minutes, or filter by unplayed or downloaded content. This feature is especially useful if you have a busy schedule and want to make the most of your free time. Currently, the Playlist feature is available on the web version and desktop apps, with a rollout for Android users already underway. The feature is arriving on iOS devices soon. The update follows Pocket Casts’ decision to make its web player free for users, further positioning itself as a strong competitor in the podcasting space against major platforms that kee", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/pocket-casts-now-lets-you-create-a-playlist-of-your-favorite-podcast-episodes/", "timestamp": 1764019041.7444494}

And addiction is amazing business. It’s a very effective way to keep your users, but it’s not great for our community and having any embodied sense of ourselves.” Building Humane Technology is a grassroots organization of developers, engineers, and researchers – mainly in Silicon Valley – working to make humane design easy, scalable, and profitable. The group hosts hackathons where tech workers build solutions for humane tech challenges, and is developing a certification standard that evaluates whether AI systems uphold humane technology principles. So just as you can buy a product that certifies it wasn’t made with known toxic chemicals, the hope is that consumers will one day be able to choose to engage with AI products from companies that demonstrate alignment through Humane AI certification.

The feature, which allows users to post under a custom username instead of their real name, provides an alternative to posting anonymously. With anonymous posting, users can share without the post being connected to their Facebook profile and real-life identity, but this approach also doesn’t allow other group members to get to know them or their personality, or to follow their updates over time. Meta says that nicknames will allow people to participate in groups more personally while maintaining privacy, particularly in groups where users want privacy but still want to build a recognizable presence. It also could make Facebook Groups function more like other internet forums and message boards — like Reddit or Discord, for instance — where people post under usernames. This marks a deviation from Facebook’s long-standing “real name” policy, which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life. That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections. After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature. This allows users to hide their main profile and profile photo from other members but not from group admins, moderators, or Facebook’s own systems. However, others in the group will be able to view a user’s complete post history under their nickname in that group, as well as the comments and reactions made in the group over the last seven days. Facebook will suggest nicknames to users, but users can change this nickname to one of their choosing.

Across large platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, users are watching billions of videos every day, with companies benefiting massively from this content explosion. For creators, this often means there is pressure to create more content than ever before to be relevant and make a living out of it, especially as more AI-generated slop is infiltrating these platforms. Jay Neo, a creator and former content lead for short videos at MrBeast, thinks AI can help creators understand what is working for them and also help them create new content ideas in that direction. That’s why, along with former Palantir engineer Shivam Kumar and creator Harry Jones, they are building a platform called Palo to aid creators. Neo joined MrBeast at 18 to work on viewer retention. In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped. “I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said. Neo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to get a baguette , which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format. In 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month. With these experiences, Neo understood there’s power in content formulation and analytics. During his time building Creaky, the team had multiple spreadsheets tracking different metrics around videos. At that time, one of Neo’s advisors suggested that he turn these insights into a product for creators, and he started working with Palo’s other co-founders in early 2024.

SitusAMC, which provides technology for over a thousand commercial and real estate financiers, confirmed in a statement over the weekend that it had identified a data breach on November 12. The company said that unspecified hackers had stolen corporate data associated with its banking customers’ relationship with SitusAMC, as well as “accounting records and legal agreements” during the cyberattack. The statement added that the scope and nature of the cyberattack “remains under investigation.” SitusAMC said that the incident is “now contained,” and that its systems are operational. The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company’s systems rather than causing destruction. According to Bloomberg and CNN , citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website. It’s unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers.

Malaysia would join a growing list of countries that are implementing age restrictions or verification measures to protect children from the risks associated with social media usage . Australia has already passed a law that will come into force on December 10, mandating social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16. France, Denmark, Italy, and Norway are working on similar age-restriction measures for social media platforms, and in the U.S., 24 states have so far enacted age-verification laws. Utah became the first U.S. state to require app stores to verify users’ ages and obtain parental consent for minors downloading apps.

It’s the dull but critical work that keeps software running the way it should, and as developers look to automate more of their workloads, it’s increasingly being done by AI. On Monday, the AI testing startup Momentic said it had raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures. Existing investors at Y Combinator, FCVC, Transpose Platform, and Karman Ventures also participated in the round. The new funding builds on a $3.7 million seed round, which the company announced in March . Momentic makes tools for software testing and verification, a niche currently occupied by open source frameworks like Playwright and Selenium. Those tools offer complex, fine-grained controls, but Momentic is counting on AI to make the process simple and effective. “We help our customers make sure their product works,” co-founder Wei-Wei Wu said. “They can describe their critical user flows in plain English and our AI will automate it.” Wu and his co-founder Jeff An both have backgrounds in developer tooling at companies like Qualtrics and WeWork. (Wu is particularly proud of his contributions to the open source Node.js.) The biggest constant for all those companies, as Wu saw it, was the problem of verifying code. “Testing has been the biggest pain point for every team I’ve ever worked with,” Wu told TechCrunch.

Stay with me — it’s not entirely far-fetched. Thanks to advances in AI, computing, and superconducting magnets , fusion power is closer than ever to commercial reality. It’s increasingly looking like fusion is more a question of “when” not “if.” And when it does happen, it promises to deliver large amounts of clean power from a plentiful fuel source — water. Putting a reactor on a ship isn’t necessarily unreasonable, either. Today, submarines and aircraft carriers powered by nuclear fission reactors routinely prowl the seas. They’re quiet, powerful, and can operate for decades before they need refueling. The civilian sector even toyed with the idea of nuclear-powered cargo ships back in the 1960s and 1970s. “Fission has definitely paved the way in terms of nuclear power on ships,” Cohen, who co-founded Maritime Fusion , told TechCrunch. Fusion promises to give ships similar capabilities but without concerns over meltdowns, proliferation, or radiation. For now, the sector has been focused on building the first reactors on land. “I’m pretty sure we’re the first people to ever really look at what is it like to put a tokamak on a ship,” Cohen said, referring to a leading fusion reactor design. If fusion does pan out, then Maritime’s leap to the seas would put it ahead of the curve. Plus, Cohen argues, it might actually be easier from a business perspective to start out at sea. The first fusion power plants won’t be cheap, and it will take some time before they come down in cost. “Competing against things like solar and wind on the grid is super challenging from a cost perspective,” Cohen said. At sea, the economics look different. Ammonia and hydrogen are two leading contenders to replace diesel and bunker fuel on cargo ships, but they’re still pretty pricey. “Those are some of the ot", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/this-startup-wants-to-build-a-fusion-reactor-on-a-boat/", "timestamp": 1764019042.9962902}

In other words, Beehiiv is about a lot more than newsletters now. Co-founder and CEO Tyler Denk (who writes a popular startup newsletter of his own) spoke to TechCrunch about why the company has been expanding, explaining that it was largely in response to customer demand, particularly since Beehiiv offered very basic blog templates from the start. “All of our users were like, ‘Hey, this is great, I like using your email stuff, [but] my blog looks like everyone else’s. It’s terrible. It’s not customizable. I want to sell courses. I want to collect leads. I want more flexibility on my website,’” Denk recalled. “So that led us to acquiring TypeDream — they were a YC company to address that need, as people wanted better websites. Then, you know, you give an inch, they ask for a mile.” This does mean Beehiiv is becoming more competitive with other creator platforms, even the ones that weren’t necessarily focused on newsletters. Indeed, Denk predicted that we’ll see “huge consolidation in the creator space,” whether that’s “through companies going out of business, or M&A or merging, or what.” That doesn’t, however, mean that Denk thinks the opportunities for new newsletters have dried up. “Quality content will always rise to the top,” he said, arguing there might be even more opportunity as the social media landscape becomes more fragmented. Read a transcript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below. You’ve repeated this quote that Beehiv is “arming the rebels of digital content.” What do you mean by that? I got the inspiration from the president of Shopify [about] arming the rebels of digital commerce — I think that’s what he said.

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool. From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure so see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What's So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but it's not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What's So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … just works. I've found Unbound's T-shirts in particular to be very quick-drying and wrinkle resis", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/unbound-merino-black-friday-sale-2025/", "timestamp": 1764019134.3631406}

You can grab an Oura Ring 4 for just $249 from Amazon , a $100 break from the normal price.

Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy This generation of the Oura smart ring has a number of major improvements, but the biggest upgrade is to the overall wearability. The sensors have been recessed further into the body of the ring itself, which reduces the overall thickness considerably and allows for a wider available range of ring sizes. They also cover a wider portion of the ring, so there's no need to keep it oriented in one specific direction to get proper readings. The battery life has improved a lot as well. The older Oura 3 could run for around three days before it needed a charge, Our reviewer, Adrienne So, reported that the Ring 4 tracked a full weekend of hiking and physical activity, as well as a music festival, and still had enough juice for at least a couple more days. You get a ton of health and physical fitness data from the ring, which is neatly sorted into daily physical data, detailed vitals, and longer trends over time, all organized in the app on your phone. If you want to also keep track of your food intake, a new Meals feature lets you take photos of what you eat and then track its effects on your body. Oura has also worked with Natural Cycles, a fertility tracking app, to predict periods using your basal body temperature. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive health and fitness tracker in a surprisingly small package, and one of the only downsides from our review was the price point for the silver-colored finishes.

Nintendo itself offers some N64 titles digitally through its Nintendo Switch Online service on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 , but it's a limited, curated collection, and only available to subscribers. Emulation poses problems, not least over questionable legality—but the N64 has been a notoriously difficult platform for emulators to crack without lag or visual glitches, partly down to the way many developers used custom microcode to maximize performance on the original hardware. And, even if you still have a vintage N64 console and a stack of game cartridges, they're not designed for modern TVs, in terms of connectivity or resolution.

When it comes to sheer physical capabilities, Kilian Jornet is as far above other world-class trail runners and mountain climbers as they are above us. This fall, the Spanish skyrunner completed his States of Elevation project, which The New York Times called “objectively absurd.” His completely self-powered mission connected all the 14,000-foot peaks in the Mountain West. He reached 72 summits, covered 629 miles on foot, and biked an additional 2,568 miles while amassing 403,691 feet of elevation gain, all in 31 days. Was it even hard for him? No. Ugh. We spoke to Jornet after he returned to Norway from States of Elevation, getting to spend time at home with his wife, the world-champion skyrunner Emelie Forsberg , and their three children. Forsberg also joined the team at Nnormal , the gear company that Jornet co-founded with the shoe company Camper . The name combines the words “Norway” and “Mallorca”—the two places where the shoes were designed and tested. “I try to have a minimalist approach, but as humans, we're not made to go into extreme environments,” said Jornet over Zoom. “If I go naked, I would probably die pretty soon, or if I go running, my feet will get pretty bruised if I'm not wearing shoes.” Here are some of the gear picks that Jornet took with him.

As soon as I got my hands on a joystick and mashed a few buttons, I was hooked.

Updated November 2025: We added the G'AIM'E Time Crisis Premium Light Gun, dimensions for each cabinet, and updated prices. Are Home Arcade Machines Worth It? Most home arcade machines are at least as expensive as the latest game consoles, sometimes far more expensive. They usually come with several games included, but they are still a considerable investment, so think carefully before you buy. Don’t get hung up on how many titles are included. It's more important to pick machines with the games you really want. For longevity, I would take quality over quantity every time. The cabinet art is also important, because these are imposing devices, and you want something you won’t get sick of looking at. Replica machines likely won’t have much resale value, and they’re tough to ship. Are ROMs Legal? While emulation software is legal, playing licensed games you have not purchased is illegal.

Instead, Amazon developed multiple specialized AI agents that compete against each other in two teams to rapidly investigate real attack techniques and different ways they could be used against Amazon's systems—and then propose security controls for human review. “The initial concept was aimed to address a critical limitation in security testing—limited coverage and the challenge of keeping detection capabilities current in a rapidly evolving threat landscape,\" Steve Schmidt, Amazon's chief security officer, tells WIRED. “Limited coverage means you can’t get through all of the software or you can’t get to all of the applications because you just don’t have enough humans. And then it’s great to do an analysis of a set of software, but if you don’t keep the detection systems themselves up to date with the changes in the threat landscape, you’re missing half of the picture.” As part of scaling its use of ATA, Amazon developed special “high-fidelity” testing environments that are deeply real", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-autonomous-threat-analysis/", "timestamp": 1764019135.7726495}

Medical technology company Masimo alleged that Apple had infringed on its patent. However, in August 2025, Apple redesigned the sensor via a software update, and you now have this feature again. Blood oxygen sensing is back! Apple revamped its entire Apple Watch line this year, which includes the entry-level Watch SE 3, the flagship Watch Series 11, and the Watch Ultra 3.

In recent months, several lawsuits have been filed against OpenAI alleging that users formed unhealthy attachments to ChatGPT.

Amid that pressure, OpenAI has been working to understand how ChatGPT should handle distressed users and improve the chatbot’s responses. Model policy is one of the teams leading that work, spearheading an October report detailing the company’s progress and consultations with more than 170 mental health experts. In the report, OpenAI said hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT users may show signs of experiencing a manic or psychotic crisis every week, and that more than a million people “have conversations that include explicit indicators of potential suicidal planning or intent.” Through an update to GPT-5, OpenAI said in the report it was able to reduce undesirable responses in these conversations by 65 to 80 percent. “Over the past year, I led OpenAI’s research on a question with almost no established precedents: how should models respond when confronted with signs of emotional over-reliance or early indications of mental health distress?” wrote Vallone in a post on LinkedIn.

What might surprise you if you haven’t shopped TVs in a while is that Panasonic now joins the usual suspects from Samsung, Sony, and LG with its new flagship, the Z95B. It’s a doozy. As with last year’s Z95A that marked Panasonic’s impressive US return , the Z95B provides near-flawless performance, from perfect black levels to pristine detail and colors. It’s brighter and more striking, thanks to skillful deployment of the same breakthrough RGB tandem panel used in the stunning LG G5 , and its built-in sound is easily the best I’ve heard from any TV all year. The biggest downside is that its premium performance is again paired with a budget smart interface; Panasonic’s version of Fire TV is awkwardly laid out and flooded with Amazon ads, right down to the remote. But for well-heeled buyers who'd rather sub in a streaming device over a soundbar or speakers , the Z95B is one of the best TVs I've laid eyes (or ears) on.

The industrial-strength swivel stand comes in one piece and attaches in seconds, keeping the 65-inch model I tested stable and accessible with four small screws. The TV looks the part of a premium flagship, with thin bezels and fabric-wrapped acoustic accents. Panasonic Z95B OLED TV Rating: 9/10 The circular base is slim enough to support an add-on soundbar, but this TV functions best as an all-in-one.

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war. Aaron Roth suspects that the pitfalls of algorithmic pricing may not have a simple sol", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/game-theory-explains-how-algorithms-can-drive-up-prices/", "timestamp": 1764019138.7321165}

Here’s everything you need to know to get started.", "content": "George Lucas famously said “sound is 50 percent of the movie-going experience,” and he ought to know. But what if you want to bring the full excitement of the movies home? How can you ensure you’re getting an audio performance that will do justice to the pictures you’re watching? By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need. Below you'll find everything you need to know about getting started with surround sound, and the kind of setup you will need in order to achieve it. Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup. You may have seen surround sound setups described numerically—most commonly as 5.1-channel or 7.1-channel surround sound systems, but so", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-perfect-surround-sound-speaker-setup/", "timestamp": 1764019138.8832965}

A chef's knife generally has a super-sharp end point and a curved, sloping edge.

One surprise is owning a dog.” The study , led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.” The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions.

Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals.

Whether you choose a French press made from glass or stainless steel, a few factors make a difference based on your personal coffee needs. Want to make the process even easier? Take a look at our guides to the Best Aeropresses , Best Electric Kettles , and Best Coffee Subscriptions . Updated November 2025: We’ve added new French presses from Barista Warrior, DHPO, Yeti, Pure Over, and Aarke, moved some picks to Honorable Mentions, and ensured links and prices are up to date. Espro Amazon Sur La Table Out of all the strainers that many French presses tout, the Espro P3’s microfilters were the most effective at removing coffee grounds. Unlike most French press filters, the Espro press's are made of fine mesh, and there are two of them, so the coffee grounds are filtered twice. The filters are in the shape of a basket with a solid plastic bottom and fine mesh walls. One would probably do the trick on its own, but for extra assurance, the Espro adds another strainer of the same build.

The issue stems from WhatsApp’s discovery feature, which allows someone to enter a person’s phone number to see if they’re on the app. By doing this billions of times—which WhatsApp did not prevent—researchers from the University of Vienna uncovered what they’re calling “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever . Vaping is a major problem in US high schools. But is the solution to spy on students in the bathroom? An investigation by The 74, copublished with WIRED, found that schools around the country are turning to vape detectors in an effort to crack down on nicotine and cannabis consumption on school grounds. Some of the vape detectors go far beyond detecting vapor by including microphones that are surprisingly accurate and revealing. While few defend addiction and drug use, even non-vapers say the added surveillance and the punishments that result go too far. Don’t look now, but that old networking equipment your company hasn’t thought about in years may jump out and bite you. Tech giant Cisco this week launched a new initiative, warning companies that AI tools are making it increasingly simple for attackers to find vulnerabilities in outdated and unpatched networking infrastructure. The message: Upgrade or else. If you’ve ever attended a conference, you probably worried about getting sick in the cesspools that are a conference center. But one hacker conference in New Zealand, Kawaiicon, invented a novel way to keep attendees a little bit safer. By tracking the CO 2 levels in each conference room, Kawaiicon’s organizers were able to create a real-time air-quality monitoring system , which would tell people which rooms were safe and which seemed … gross.

This could vastly improve a seriously fractured landscape, enabling you to easily add and access your cameras on whatever platform you choose. It’s also something that can potentially be delivered in a software update, so some of the cameras you already own might get Matter support. All the top gear news of the week in one place . Here's more you may have missed this week: You may be worrying about limitations, but the supported feature list is impressive, including video and audio streaming, two-way communication, local and remote access, multiple streams, pan-tilt-zoom controls, and both detection and privacy zones. There’s also support for continuous or event-based recording, either locally or to the cloud. What it won’t handle is how that storage is managed, meaning some camera manufacturers will still require you to use their cloud-based subscription models. Pleasingly, there are no limitations on resolution, unlike Apple HomeKit Secure Video , or restrictions on AI detection features. Matter is using WebRTC technology, with remote access handled via the STUN and TURN protocols, meaning that manufacturers can choose to implement end-to-end encryption for footage.

Designed to sit under your TV as comfortably as it would under a monitor, these are micro PCs —but only because Valve seems shy of branding them consoles . The new Steam Machines are Valve's second attempt at launching a dedicated device to bring the PC into the living room. The first generation Steam Machines launched a decade ago, in November 2015, and while that iteration ultimately flopped , the marketplace in 2025 is much different. The Steam Deck has been a huge success, inspiring a whole fleet of gaming handhelds —with even Xbox joining the party —and PC gaming as a whole is in a much stronger position. So, when the announcement video for this new product family went to great lengths to explain that the new Steam Machine is still a PC and not a console, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. Valve makes and sells PC games; here's a PC to play those games on. Except … c'mon, look at it: In every way that counts, the new Steam Machine effectively is a console—and that's no bad thing. Pop quiz: What defines a games console? Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big-screen television. The benefits include fixed specifications, meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers know that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course). Roughly every half-decade, they might buy a new-generation model. What then defines a PC, gaming or otherwise? Almost the opposite—a typically desk-bound rig, built from whatever parts the user fancies, and when they need a bit more power, they can swap", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/valve-says-steam-machine-isnt-a-console-but-it-is/", "timestamp": 1764019142.3189328}

A police scanner recording archived on the app describes the suspect by name and alleges he may have purchased weapons with the intention of targeting additional OpenAI locations. Hours before the incident on Friday, the individual who police flagged as allegedly making the threat said he was no longer part of Stop AI in a post on social media. In a statement to WIRED which was subsequently posted on X, Stop AI disavowed the alleged actions of the individual and said the organization is “deeply committed to nonviolence.” WIRED reached out to the man in question but did not immediately receive a response. San Francisco police also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI did not provide a statement prior to publication. On Slack, the internal communications team provided three images of the man suspected of making the threat.

The deal: an iPad Air for 15 euros (about $17) instead of the usual €879 (about $1,012). No catch, no strings attached. The proximity to Black Friday only made the offer more plausible. And so several consumers immediately purchased the product by choosing the “payment and pickup in store” opetion, on paper the safest to avoid unexpected problems. The process was seamless, even for those ordering online. According to the accounts of some users on Reddit, their order was accepted, and after about 40 minutes they received an email confirming the availability of the product.

The terms and conditions attached to the order make no mention of any clause regarding pricing errors or the possibility for the company to request subsequent additions.

Use the star function to highlight notable finds.", "content": "Last week, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released 20,000 documents from the estate of registered sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein . They included thousands of emails sent between Epstein and high-profile people like Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, political strategist Steve Bannon , journalist Michael Wolff, and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers , as well as revealing text messages . Many of them allude or directly refer to president Donald Trump. Now, you can browse all those emails just like you would on your own Gmail account. Jmail is a website that looks very much like Gmail, except that there is a little hat hanging on the logo and that the profile picture in the top right corner is a grinning Epstein. (Click on it and it says “Hi Jeffrey!”) The inbox lets you click through thousands of emails, formatted to look exactly like a regular message would in your inbox. In the sidebar, you can sort by Inbox, Starred, and Sent. In Gmail, a lower sidebar section reads Labels and separates emails by category. In Jmail, it is a list of people who corresponded with Epstein. The site was created by serial prankster Riley Walz and Luke Igel, cofounder of an AI video editing tool called Kino AI . Igel tells WIRED that he brought the idea to Walz—something Walz confirms—and then the two of them put the website together with Cursor in a single night. Walz revealed Jmail in an X post , writing, “We cloned Gmail, except you're logged in as Epstein and can see his emails.” Jmail is a much more readable way to peruse the huge cache of emails released from the Epstein estate than parsing through tens of thousands of PDFs on a Google Drive.

Both platforms get access to one-touch pairing and the helpful Beats app, while iPhone owners also get the benefits of Hey Siri and Find My Device. The other features are a bit of a mixed bag, with a decent battery life of up to 24 hours with ANC on, or 40 with ANC off, but no auto pause when you take them off, or multi-point pairing beyond Google's Chromebook and Android option. Like most headphones from Beats, the sound profile is decidedly bass-forward, but Apple's ownership has tempered that tendency over the last few years. As a result, this generation is more balanced than previous eras, with our reviewer Ryan Waniata complimenting the expansive sound stage and sharp details. Unfortunately, most Beats headsets don't have any equalizer, and the Studio Pro are no different. For better or worse, you're stuck with how they sound coming out of the box. These at least support high-resolution audio, up to 24-bit/48-kHz, but only in the wired USB-C mode. For the Beats enthusiast looking for an upgrade or a second headset for the gym, these are a solid option at a deeply discounted price.

In China, parents are buying them for children as young as five. Adults want to be able to call their kids and track their location down to a specific building floor. But that’s not why children are clamoring for the devices, specifically ones made by a company called Xiaotiancai, which translates to Little Genius in English. The watches, which launched in 2015 and cost up to $330, are a portal into an elaborate world that blends social engagement with relentless competition. Kids can use the watches to buy snacks at local shops, chat and share videos with friends, play games, and, sure, stay in touch with their families. But the main activity is accumulating as many “likes” as possible on their watch’s profile page. On the extreme end, Chinese media outlets have reported on kids who buy bots to juice their numbers, hack the watches to dox their enemies, and sometimes even find romantic partners. According to tech research firm Counterpoint Research, Little Genius accounts for nearly half of global market share for kids’ smartwatches. Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle.

The queries appear to be connected to an ongoing investigation by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’s chair, Senator Rand Paul, into the “weaponization of the Quiet Skies Program,” which was the subject of a September 30 hearing on Capitol Hill. While Paul’s inquiry was lauded by Muslim-American organizations as a long-overdue examination of abusive federal surveillance, it appears the inquiry is a broader attempt to target academic researchers on extremism, which could chill inquiries into far-right radicalization. At least three university research centers focused on extremism received requests for documentation from the Senate committee in the past two months. A copy of a letter from the committee reviewed by WIRED asks the university that received it to turn over records for all communications, reports, memoranda, or data exchanged with federal staff from January 1, 2020, through February 1, 2025, and any records regarding Quiet Skies and the No Fly List, the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Database. The university was also instructed to identify all staff who held federal security clearances, any and all sources of federal grant funding, and internal procedures. Critically, sources tell WIRED that the Senate committee requested the research centers disclose all emails, internal and external, relating to a massive list of more than 300 query terms, which include “mask mandates,” “origins of Covid-19,” “Trump supporters or the Trump Campaign,” “Capitol Police.” FBI director Kash Patel, US attorney general Pam Bondi, Department of Justice operative and former interim US attorney for the Distr", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/senators-want-extremism-researchers-to-surrender-documents-linked-to-right-wing-grudges/", "timestamp": 1764019144.2514114}

They’re fairly recognizable from a distance with their clear housing, cameras, and solar panels, and perhaps a friend or family member has sent you a photo or video of a bright goldfinch or handsome woodpecker (guilty). The question at this point, then, is whether these things are really worth the $100-plus price tag. Are they actually durable? And what about the squirrel problem? Lucky for you, we’ve been testing the most popular smart bird feeder models, including Netvue’s original Birdfy feeder ($140) and Bird Buddy's Pro ($179) , for over a year—in rain, snow, and heat, and in a yard with persistent squirrels. We’ve explored the apps and notification settings, examined the photo and video quality, noted which features are hidden behind a subscription paywall, and used Cornell Lab’s All About Birds —as well as Google Lens and our own local expertise—to verify the accuracy of AI identifications. Updated November 2025: We’ve added the new Birdfy Wood and Rookie feeders to Honorable Mentions and named Camojojo's Hibird Pro as a new pick.

At that time, we gave it a 6/10 rating for its high price and wonky AI. Both metrics have improved dramatically since then—Birdfy's app is now the second-most user-friendly on the market, behind only Bird Buddy, and this feeder is often on sale for $150 or less. If you pay $20 more, you get a lifetime subscription for AI identification, which is a solid deal. Without it, it'll cost you $5 a month , but it's not required to get plenty of enjoyment.

The announcement could come as soon as today (November 24). “Until President Trump makes an announcement himself, any reporting about the Administration’s healthcare positions is mere speculation,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said, according to USA Today. The policy proposal reportedly includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies set to expire at the end of December, combined with new eligibility limits for enrollment, Politico reported. Without an extension, about 22 million Americans who rely on Obamacare tax credits could see their monthly premiums more than double in 2026, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). The expiring subsidies have put Congress, particularly Republicans, in a political dilemma as they seek to avoid a major backlash ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Also, as part of the recently approved deal to end the 43-day government shutdown, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the subsidies in December. Trump has long advocated overhauling the ACA, the signature health law of former President Barack Obama. He has floated sending federal dollars directly to consumers rather than health insurance companies. The health care announcement comes shortly after the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dissolved with eight months left on its mandate. OPM Director Scott Kupor told Reuters that DOGE “doesn’t exist”. DOGE had previously claimed to have cut tens of billions of dollars in government spending, though the office did not provide detailed public accounting. Some DOGE staff have been reassigned to other agencies or initiatives, including the National Design Studio and regulatory reform efforts.

Since then, there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. Now we can set our sights on the big picture,” Trump said, emphasizing the “extremely strong” US-China relationship.  The announcement followed a phone call between the two leaders, during which they discussed trade, the Russia-Ukraine war, and Taiwan . China’s foreign ministry highlighted the sensitive Taiwan issue , with Xi calling its return to mainland China “an integral part of the post-war international order.” “Given what is going on, it is even more important for us to jointly safeguard the victory of WWII,” Xi told Trump. The call also came amid a diplomatic dispute between Beijing and Japan after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested Tokyo could intervene militarily if China attacked Taiwan . Trump and Xi reviewed progress since their late-October meeting in Busan, South Korea , where the two leaders reached a tentative trade agreement. Under the deal, Beijing agreed to suspend certain export restrictions on critical minerals for a year, while the US committed to cut tariffs and increase soybean purchases . Xi emphasized the importance of maintaining momentum, saying the South Korea meeting “recalibrated the course of the giant ship of China-US relations and provided more momentum for it to sail forward steadily.” Trump also highlighted progress on trade and agricultural deals, stating, “We have done a good, and very important, dea", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/trump-announces-beijing-visit-in-april-following-phone-call-with-xi-jinping-invites-chinese-leader-to-us-state-visit-11764013527883.html", "timestamp": 1764019186.131976}

Police said the operation took place on Saturday after residents alerted authorities to the group’s presence. Officers moved quickly, citing warning signs of a potential trafficking network. According to a police report, “There are indications that some of them may have been kidnapped, suggesting a possible human trafficking scenario, under the guise of religious activity.” The children — who come from several countries, including the United States and Guatemala — were moved to a government-run protection center. Arriero said that five of the rescued children were listed in Interpol Yellow Notices, which are global alerts for missing persons or potential victims of parental or criminal abduction. She said her agency acted after determining the group arrived in Colombia in late October and was staying in a hotel while looking for rural land to establish a new base. Arriero noted that officials were able to intervene quickly because the group lacked an established site. “The positive thing in all of this is that we got to the children before they had a compound,” she said. “Because in that case, we would have required a search warrant.” In Colombia, immigration officials are authorized to carry out checks in hotels to verify the legal status of foreign visitors and determine whether they are wanted by international law enforcement.

US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie concluded that Lindsey Halligan — a former Trump personal attorney appointed interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in September — was installed “hastily and without proper authority.” The unlawful appointment, the judge said, rendered her actions legally void and undermined the integrity of the politically charged cases. Halligan was named to the post after interim U.S. attorney Erik Siebert resigned under pressure from the Trump administration to pursue charges against Comey and James. Comey’s lawyers argued that once Siebert stepped down, only the district’s federal judges had the authority to fill the vacancy, not the White House. Currie dismissed both indictments without prejudice, meaning the Justice Department could theoretically refile the charges. Comey and James had asked for dismissals with prejudice to prevent any future prosecution. It remains unclear whether the DOJ will attempt to revive either case. Comey was indicted on allegations of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Letitia James faced charges tied to a mortgage fraud inquiry. Both indictments were signed exclusively by Halligan, whom the judge described as the “driving force” behind the prosecutions. Trump had publicly demanded legal action against both officials, posting on Truth Social that “JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!” He has long regarded Comey as an adversary, dating back to the Russia investigation he oversaw before Trump fired him in 2017.

Bolsonaro, who claims medication-induced hallucinations led to the incident.", "content": "A four-judge panel of Brazil’s Supreme Court on Monday (November 24) unanimously voted to keep former President Jair Bolsonaro in police custody, two days after Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered his arrest citing a flight risk . Justices Flávio Dino, Cristiano Zanin and Carmen Lúcia joined Moraes in upholding the decision, ending more than 100 days of house arrest for the former leader. Bolsonaro, 70, is awaiting final appeals against his 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva . Bolsonaro was arrested early Saturday after authorities said he reportedly used a soldering iron to tamper with his court-mandated ankle monitor . The breach occurred just hours before supporters were expected to gather outside his home — a gathering Justice Moraes warned could disrupt police monitoring. In Sunday testimony, Bolsonaro said he had suffered a “nervous breakdown” caused by a change in medication, leading to “paranoia and hallucination” when he attempted to break the device. He denied any intention to flee . Justice Dino rejected that argument in his written vote: \"The admitted breach of electronic monitoring not only increases the risk of escape but also indicates a blatant violation of the precautionary measures imposed by the Judiciary.” Moraes, who issued the arrest warrant, wrote that Bolsonaro had shown “repeated non-compliance with precautionary measures” and “evident disrespect to the court,” noting that the former president himself acknowledged tampering with the device. According to case documents, authorities detected interference with Bolsonaro’s ankle monitor at 12:08 a.m. on Saturday, prompting the arrest order hours later. Bolsonaro had been under house arrest since August, following his conviction in September for plotting a coup aimed at overturning his 2022 defeat.

The civilian locksmith, 76-year-old David Long, was known for his “dedicated service and kind demeanor,” Sheriff Eric Flowers said in a social media post Sunday. Indian River County Sheriff's Deputy Terri Sweeting-Mashkow — a 25-year veteran of the agency — was killed when the man they were trying to evict opened fire Friday morning. That man, Michael Halberstam, died from his wounds on Saturday, Flowers said.  Another deputy, Florentino Arizpe, who was shot in the shoulder, was released from the hospital over the weekend, the sheriff said. The sheriff's office had received seven calls from the home over the past month, “almost all” of which were from the mother calling about her son, the sheriff said during a news conference on Friday. Even so, he said, deputies weren’t expecting any trouble when they arrived to evict Halberstam. Flowers did not say in his post if Sweeting-Mashkow and Long were wearing protective gear, and the sheriff’s office did not respond to an email on the matter Monday morning.

The remarks come as Beijing pushes back against Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s recent suggestion that Japan’s military could intervene if China moved against the self-governed island Taiwan . China views Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to assert control. Beyond Taiwan , Xi told Trump that bilateral relations had “stabilised and improved” since their October 30 meeting in South Korea . “The facts again show that cooperation benefits both sides while confrontation hurts both,” Xi said, adding that the leaders’ earlier meeting had “helped calibrate the course and inject momentum into the steady forward movement of the giant ship of China-US relations.” He urged Washington to “maintain momentum in ties” and expand cooperation in key areas. Chinese state media said trade featured in the conversation, though no new agreements were announced. The discussion comes on the heels of a trade truce that saw Washington roll back tariffs by 10% and Beijing ease restrictions on rare earth exports. China has also resumed buying US soybeans — long a sticking point in negotiations. Trump suggested last week that Beijing was preparing to increase purchases: “They’re in the process of doing it… they’ll be doing a lot of soybean purchase.” Talks on rare earth export “general licenses” are continuing, with shortages this year disrupting global supply chains for industries ranging from automobiles to robotics.

The incident has sparked concerns over China’s repeated challenges to India’s territorial claims. Prema Wangjom Thongdok, who was en route from London to Japan on 21 November, said her scheduled three-hour stopover turned into a harrowing experience after immigration officers declared her passport “invalid” simply because it mentioned Arunachal Pradesh as her birthplace. Thongdok, whose family is from Rupa in the West Kameng district, alleged that Chinese authorities insisted that Arunachal Pradesh “belongs to China” and pressured her to acknowledge their claim before they would continue processing her transit. In a detailed post on X on Sunday, she claimed, “I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hours on 21st November 2025 by China immigration and China Eastern Airlines. They called my Indian passport invalid because my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory.” She claimed that she was confined to the transit area without clear explanations, access to proper food, or basic facilities. She also claimed that her passport was confiscated and she was prevented from boarding her connecting flight to Japan despite carrying a valid visa. What should have been a routine transit, she said, turned into a distressing standoff with airport authorities. She eventually reached the Indian consulate in Shanghai with the help of a friend in the UK. Officials there assisted her in catching a late-night flight out of the Chinese city, according to reports.

Trump did not provide details on what prompted his optimism, and neither Washington nor Kyiv immediately commented on the message. His remarks, however, come amid renewed diplomatic activity involving US, Ukrainian and European officials, who have been working to narrow differences over competing proposals for a potential peace framework. The Russia-Ukraine conflict , now in its third year, has escalated pressure on all sides as Russia continues battlefield advances and Ukraine faces mounting political strains. US and Ukrainian officials said on Monday they had agreed to refine a US peace proposal after talks in Geneva , issuing a joint statement that they had drafted a “refined peace framework.” Details were not disclosed, but the discussions received a cautious welcome from some European allies. President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukraine’s delegation was returning from Switzerland to brief him. “Negotiations are ongoing,” he said. The US surprised Kyiv and European partners last week with a 28-point peace plan that Kyiv and allies viewed as tilted toward Moscow’s demands . The plan reportedly required Ukraine to cede more territory, accept limits on its military, and agree never to join NATO — conditions Ukraine has long rejected as surrender. Kyiv’s European allies quickly drafted a counter-proposal.

The assessment will be done on a case-to-case basis and the details of the study are expected within 45 days. Mint had earlier reported that the power ministry has asked renewable energy implementation agencies to cancel projects for which PSAs and PPAs have not been signed. The ministry of new and renewable energy had on 4 November said that any cancellation would take place in a phased manner only after all viable options for executing power sale and purchase pacts are fully explored. The ministry of new and renewable energy had earlier this month said that PSAs and PPAs have not been signed for nearly 43.94 GW of awarded capacity. The issue is significant, as prolonged delays risk slowing India’s plan to add 50 GW of renewable capacity each year to reach 500GW by 2030 and advance toward its net-zero target by 2070. Power developers sign PPAs with procurers or the renewable energy implementation agencies (REIA), who further sign PSAs with power distribution companies (discoms). Many discoms have chosen to wait for tariffs to go lower, rather than sign PSAs, holding up the whole process. The issue brings major concern for India's ambitious energy transition plans as it aims for 1,800 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2047 and 5,000 GW by 2070. Slow progress in terms of transmission capacity addition has added to the lack of interest for new green power contracts.

In a statement on X, the NWS posted: “Bottom Line, Up Front: The central US could see cooler than normal temperatures Thanksgiving week while areas of the west and Florida could see above normal temperatures.”  The agency added that below-normal temperatures are likely across the Central and Northern US, including the Pacific Northwest, Great Plains, northern Texas and parts of the Mid-Atlantic, beginning November 25 and increasing in intensity from November 26–30. A cross-country storm could disrupt the Thanksgiving travel plans of millions, AccuWeather meteorologists warned. As the storm sweeps east, it will bring heavy rain, thunderstorms, snow and strong winds across the central, southern and eastern US.

The term originated in the 1990s, referring to military officers who amassed wealth through drug trafficking. Over time, it has come to encompass police and government officials involved in activities such as illegal mining and fuel smuggling. According to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the group is responsible for “terrorist violence throughout our hemisphere” and for trafficking drugs into the United States and Europe. The Department of State announced that the designation of the cartel as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) will take effect on Monday (November 24) marking a significant escalation in the Trump administration’s campaign against narcotics and illegal immigration from Latin America. Rubio said in a statement: “Cartel de los Soles is headed by Nicolás Maduro and other high-ranking individuals of the illegitimate Maduro regime who have corrupted Venezuela’s military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary. Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela’s legitimate government.” The US Treasury Department had previously designated the cartel as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” in July , freezing its US assets and barring Americans from engaging with it. The Justice Department has also indicted Maduro and his inner circle for narcoterrorism and drug trafficking, with a current reward of $50 million for information leading to his arrest.

This comes on the back of the government last week implementing four new labour codes, revamping the existing Labour Laws in India in order to expand job and social security benefits to employees in India.

The report added that the bills to be introduced and discussed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government in Parliament during the Winter Session are aimed at improving ease of doing business. PM Modi wants to achieve the ‘Viksit Bharat’ goal by 2047, which requires that the world's fourth largest economy grow at a rate of 8%. However, this is a number that many multilateral institutions and economists opine would be difficult without key reforms. Notably, the Indian economy is also facing pressure from United States President Donald Trump 's 50% tariffs (25% reciprocal, 25% “punishment” for buying Russian oil) on all Indian imports into the US. The rate is among the highest imposed by the US on most countries. In a survey of economists conducted by Bloomberg, the median estimate was that India’s economy is expected to grow 7.3% in the three months to September. The data is due on 28 November 2025.

However, even after 20 days, the ticketing system has still not been updated, and no disabled passenger is able to avail the discount,” Kaitike said in a post on social media platform X, as reported by PTI. He claimed Mumbai's first underground corridor, Metro Line-3 or Aqua line, is still not disability-friendly as several lifts remain non-functional, making it impossible for wheelchair users to travel.

Ltd. The single judge bench of Justice Tejas Karia restrained Tesla Power from using Tesla Inc.’s registered trademarks, device marks, or logos in any form until the suit is decided. The order bars Tesla Power from using, soliciting, offering services or advertising under the impugned mark, including on the internet and e-commerce platforms, in relation to batteries for all kinds of vehicles, automotive UPS systems, inverters, solar hybrid valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries, sealed maintenance-free VRLA batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. The direction follows Tesla Power’s own June 2024 statement that it had no intention of infringing on the US electric vehicle (EV) maker’s trademark, as well as the failure of mediation efforts. Tesla Inc. filed its first lawsuit in India in May 2024, alleging that Tesla Power was misleading consumers by implying an association with the US company’s EVs . The US giant argued that this created confusion just as it prepared to enter the Indian market. The court then prohibited Tesla Power from promoting or selling products bearing the Tesla name. On 30 May, Tesla Power informed the court that it had directed its partners and vendors to remove the Tesla logo from e-Ashwa electric scooters, which were sold through a marketing partnership, to comply with a 2 May order. On 4 June, both sides agreed to mediation. Tesla Power told the court it did not intend to manufacture or market electric scooters using the Tesla name. It admitted, however, that 699 e-Ashwa scooters carrying the Tesla branding had already been sold by dealers and partners. The court then directed the company to take further steps to comply with its orders and to refrain from any EV-related activity using the Tesla mark.

Michel, an accused in the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter case , is seeking a declaration that the extradition treaty between India and the UAE cannot override the Indian Extradition Act, 1962. Through his counsel, Advocate Aljo K. Joseph, Michel contended that the bilateral treaty is subordinate to a statute enacted by the Indian Parliament and, therefore, cannot be invoked to justify legal proceedings that extend beyond what the legislation permits. A Division Bench comprising Justices Vivek Chaudhary and Manoj Jain sought formal responses from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of External Affairs, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Bench also clarified that the respondents were at liberty to raise any objections regarding the maintainability of the petition. The plea highlights that the Extradition Act, specifically Section 21, provides a statutory safeguard stating that an extradited individual may not be tried for offences other than those for which he was originally extradited. ********************* • Christian Michel is currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar Jail in the estimated ₹ 3,600 crore AgustaWestland money laundering case. •  Michel was extradited from Dubai in December 2018 and was subsequently arrested by the CBI and ED. •  CBI chargesheet claims an estimated loss of about ₹ 2,666 crore to the exchequer due to the VVIP chopper deal. The petition further asserts that the introduction of new charges, including offences under Section 467 of the IPC, violates the Doctrine of Speciality and directly conflicts with the extradition decree issued by the UAE authorities. Michel’s lawyer argued that parliamentary law must prevail in the event of any conflict with a treaty, citing binding Supreme Court precedents, such as Gramophone Company of India Ltd. vs. Birendra Bahadur Pandey and Daya", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/delhi-high-court-seeks-responses-on-christian-michel-s-challenge-to-india-uae-extradition-treaty-in-agustawestland-case-11763975455302.html", "timestamp": 1764019191.877067}

Five individuals have been arrested in connection with the drug racket , which investigators suspect may have international links, the official told PTI . The operation began on 7 October, when police laid a trap in the Madanpur Khadar Extension-I area in South East Delhi. They apprehended Mohd Abid (50), a resident of Madanpur Khadar, who was carrying a large bag, a senior police officer said. On inspection, the bag was found to contain 54,000 tablets of Treken-100, a Tramadol-based psychotropic medicine, banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, he said. Tramadol, a strictly controlled opioid (painkiller), was classified as a psychotropic substance under the Act in 2018. Following the seizure, an FIR was registered under provisions of the NDPS Act, and police arrested Abid, the officer added. During interrogation, Abid disclosed that he was working with an associate, Javed Khan (45), a resident of Johri Farm in the Jamia Nagar area. Khan was subsequently arrested, police told PTI . Further investigation led to the arrest of three more people: – Sunil Kumar (40), who managed a warehouse in Samalka near the Kapashera border. — Vishnu Dutt Sharma (62), an exporter from Dwarka. — Vikas Singh alias Ishwar Yadav (38), the owner of a courier business in Rangpuri. The five accused were found to be a part of an organised network involved in the procurement, storage and distribution of banned Tramadol tablets across Delhi and other states.

Politician named after infamous dictator eyes another election win in Namibia", "summary": "Despite his steady political career, Uunona’s rise to global attention came because of his name — identical to that of the German dictator responsible for one of history’s darkest chapters.", "content": "As Namibia heads to the polls on 26 November, one name continues to draw global attention: Adolf Hitler Uunona, the African politician whose unusual name has sparked headlines worldwide. The 59-year-old Swapo party councillor is widely expected to retain his seat, with early projections from the country’s electoral commission suggesting another clear win. Uunona gained international prominence in 2020, when he won the Ompundja constituency with 85% of the vote, securing 1,196 votes to his rival’s 213. The constituency then counted only 2,520 registered voters, making his victory a commanding one. Despite his steady political career, Uunona’s rise to global attention was largely due to his name, which is identical to that of the German dictator responsible for one of history’s darkest chapters. Speaking to Bild, the Namibian politician firmly distanced himself from any association with Nazi ideology, saying he had “nothing to do” with it. In earlier comments to BBC News , he explained how he was named: “My father gave me this name Hitler, he didn't understand what the name Adolf Hitler stood for.… When I was young, it was just a normal name.” He added that he only realised its historical weight later in life. Adolf Hitler Uunona is a long-time member of the Swapo party, which has governed Namibia since independence in 1990. He is known locally as a fierce anti-apartheid campaigner and is respected in his constituency. Swapo, originally born from Namibia’s independence movement, has dominated national politics for decades. However, recent years have seen a drop in its support, partly due to bribery allegations involving the fishing industry. In the last national elections, the party lost control of 30 major towns and cities, although it still maintains a strong influence in many rural areas, including Ompundja. Namibia’s connection to Germany stems from its colonial past. Between 1884 and 1915, the country formed part of German South West Africa.

The ceremony, held at the Naval Dockyard in Mumbai, was hosted by Vice Admiral Krishna Swaminathan, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Western Naval Command. INS Mahe is the first of the Mahe-class Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Craft, which is abbreviated as ASW-SWC in naval terms. The Mahe-class craft is designed for shallow waters, boosting coastal defence. It will help detect and neutralise enemy submarines. The ship was built by Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) and delivered to the Navy on 23 October. It is the first of the eight ASW-SWC being built by Cochin Shipyard Limited. The full induction is expected to be completed by 2027. INS Mahe has been named after the historic coastal town of Mahe on the Malabar coast, which is a symbol of India's maritime legacy. Meanwhile, the ship’s motto, “Silent Hunters”, embodies stealth, vigilance and unwavering resolve - qualities that define anti-submarine warfare ethos, the Indian Navy said. The ship has been equipped with torpedoes and anti-submarine rockets. It's designed to hunt submarines, conduct coastal patrols, and secure India's vital maritime approaches. The ASW SWC ships are 78 metres long and have a displacement of approximately 900 tons, with a maximum speed of 25 knots. The Navy said the ship's crest features an ‘Urumi’ – the flexible sword of Kalarippayattu, symbolising agility, precision and lethal grace, the Indian Navy added. The commissioning of INS Mahe marks the arrival of a new generation of indigenous shallow-water combatants - “sleek, swift, and resolutely Indian”, the Ministry of Defence said, adding that INS Mahe has over 80% indigenous content.

A group of about 20 young men approached by Duduzile Zuma, a South African lawmaker, traveled to Russia in July after being told they would train as bodyguards to work for Jacob Zuma’s political party, Bloomberg reported last week. They signed military contracts written entirely in Russian, were sent to the frontlines in Ukraine and lost contact with their families in August, according to the some of their relatives. Nkosazana Zuma-Ncube, another of Zuma’s daughters, opened a criminal case against Duduzile Zuma and two other individuals for luring the men to Russia under false pretenses and handing them over to a mercenary group to fight in the Ukraine war without their knowledge or consent, the South African Police Service said in a statement. Charges are still to be determined through an investigation, the police said. Duduzile Zuma didn’t answer calls to her mobile phone seeking comment. The men’s plight first came to light after President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered a probe into how South African citizens were recruited to fight as mercenaries in Russia’s war against Ukraine. In a Nov. 6 statement, Ramaphosa’s office said 17 South Africans stuck in the Donbas region of Ukraine had contacted South Africa’s government seeking help. Duduzile Zuma has previously been tied to Russian campaigns on social media, where she posted support on the X platform for Russian President Vladimir Putin, showed pictures of herself in Russia and her father with Putin, and denigrated Ramaphosa.
