The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said.

In 1972, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Bihar Engineering College, now known as NIT Patna. During his college years, he participated in technical clubs and projects. After earning his engineering degree, Nitish Kumar began his career at the Bihar State Electricity Board, but his growing interest in social issues and public life soon drew him away from engineering, and he chose politics.

Its roots stretch back to 1886, when the Pleaders’ Survey Training School was founded in Patna.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards. Finally, a student who is not doing well with NCERT is likely also not going to do well with JEE Main. So there isn’t a need to study separate concepts to prepare for the two outcomes.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category.

The petitioners said at the time of filing the plea, the city was under the Grade Response Action Plan-III (GRAP-III) emergency plan and risked escalation to GRAP-IV.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control.

The fall semester began in August/September this year. “For India, the top sender of international students whose numbers soared post-pandemic, the majority of institutions now report new enrolment declines, with only 39 per cent of institutions noting increased or stable numbers. These declines in new enrollment from India are likely driving the overall national declines in new enrollment,” the report on the fall 2025 session noted. In IIE’s survey, institutions pointed to challenges that impacted new enrolments this year – 96 per cent of them referred to visa delays connected to long wait times. In comparison, 81 per cent of them referred to the pause in visa issuances for a few weeks in May and June, and 91 per cent reported visa denials as a factor contributing to fewer new student arrivals. While 96 per cent of institutions cited the visa application process as a factor in the decline of new international student enrolment this year, this figure was only 64 per cent in the fall of 2021, and was at 85 per cent last year. The fall snapshot was released along with the Open Doors 2025 report Monday, which shows that new international student enrolment in 2024", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/international-student-enrolments-in-us-universities-dropp-2025-26-iie-10369929/", "timestamp": 1763925093.3810997}

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022.

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states.

I still remember my own XAT 2011 experience. With a 98.71 percentile, what helped me most was not a rare trick or flash of brilliance. It was a calm clock. Each section was a 40-minute race, and the way to win was to pace, not panic. Now that the Common Admission Test ( CAT 2025 ) will be held in two weeks, candidates must be wondering how to master the 40-minute race. CAT will have the following three sections – Section I: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, Section II: Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning and Section III: Quantitative Ability. Candidates will be allotted exactly 40 minutes for answering questions in each section and they will not be allowed to switch from one section to another while answering questions in a section.

Decide a realistic target: “I’ll attempt 12 with accuracy above 85%.” This small “warm-up lap” lowers anxiety and prevents early sunk-cost mistakes. Treat it like triage. – Pass 1 (2–18 min): Attempt only A-grade questions – short, familiar, and clean.

The lab’s research will primarily focus on Indian languages, providing valuable insights into the understanding and production of grammar, voice, and sentence structure in multilingual contexts. While ongoing projects study grammatical voice and copula constructions, upcoming work will examine dyslexia in Indian children, with the goal of improving educational outcomes and developing linguistically relevant teaching interventions. The LC-Lab’s interdisciplinary framework integrates insights from science, technology, and the humanities to advance both academic research and technological innovation. In the short term, the LC-Lab will conduct experimental research using eye-tracking technology to validate established linguistic theories in Indian languages. In the long term, it plans to integrate advanced neurocognitive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). These tools will enable comprehensive research in language, cognition, and computational modelling while fostering collaboration with experts in psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

Assam has talents in various fields, and if these talents are identified and nurtured through education, they can contribute greatly to society, he said.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

A draft artificial intelligence (AI) and computational thinking curriculum developed by the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) for classes 3 to 12 also focuses on introducing foundational concepts of AI in the lower classes, along with advanced computational thinking and AI as compulsory subjects in classes 9 and 10, official sources said. The draft curriculum, which has been submitted to the NCERT for review, provides a structure for schools to introduce computational thinking and AI in a phased and progressive manner from classes 3 to 12. The curriculum is in line with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which calls for the introduction of “contemporary” subjects like AI, design thinking, and holistic health in the curriculum.

For classes 3 to 5, the curriculum recommends that computational thinking — currently a part of the math curriculum in school — be embedded in all subjects such as language, and ‘The World Around Us’, which includes components of environmental studies, science and social science, the sources said. For these classes, assessments on computational thinking will be linked to core subjects that students learn, like math, they added. A similar approach is recommended for classes 6 to 8, where the curriculum suggests incorporating computational thinking into all subjects.

Dr Rahul Shukla, Xavier Aptitude Test (XAT) convener and chairperson of admissions at XLRI, informed indianexpress.com that some foreign colleges will soon accept XAT score for admission. “Loyola University in the United States has already agreed to accept XAT scores and is in the final phases of discussion. European and East Asian universities are also in negotiations,” he said. As registrations for XAT 2026 continue, management aspirants across India are gearing up for one of the country’s most prominent MBA entrance exams, conducted by XLRI Jamshedpur on behalf of the Xavier Association of Management Institutes (XAMI). Shukla highlighted how the test includes elements like pop-culture references, such as Harry Potter (a series of novels by JK Rowling on a fictional wizard), in its questions, what makes it different from other mainstream management entrance exams among other things. In an unprecedented move for an MBA entrance test, XAT 2025 incorporated questions featuring Harry Potter characters and themes. The response was extraordinary. The reasoning is both practical and compassionate. When test-takers encounter familiar characters they love, even if the challenge remains rigorous, it provides a moment of connection and ease. “This philosophy extends throughout the exam’s design. XAT has introduced poems as reading comprehension passages and cartoons from The New Yorker for interpreting visual humor,” in one memorable instance, students tracked down the actual cartoonist on Instagram to discuss the question, Shukla shared. Recognising that reading lengthy passages on screens differs from paper, test-makers deliberately reduced passage lengths. Everything now fits on one screen, doing-away with the need for excessive scrolling. For years, XAT has carried a reputation for being one of the “toughest” MBA entrance examinations.

The move comes after the Centre enforced Stage III restrictions of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Tuesday, following a sharp rise in pollution levels across Delhi -NCR. It’s a double whammy for parents—keeping kids healthy indoors while making sure their learning doesn’t skip a beat. But don’t worry, with a little planning and some solid teamwork between parents and schools, kids can stay safe, sharp, and spirited even when the air outside is a foggy mess and classes have gone digital. Here’s how parents can turn this challenge into a win. A small, peaceful space at home can do wonders for focus. Pick a quiet, well-lit corner that’s just for study time. Keep essentials — books, pencils, and a water bottle — close by so your child doesn’t need to move around constantly. A clean table, some fresh air, and even a small plant can make the space feel calm and welcoming. Many families juggle online classes with limited devices. Setting a simple schedule helps avoid confusion; decide who uses what, and when. Schools are usually happy to share recorded lessons or offline worksheets, so don’t hesitate to ask. If possible, use phones for lighter tasks like quizzes or reading to free up laptops for live sessions. When outdoor play is restricted, structure becomes the anchor of the day. Keep regular wake-up and meal times, mix study hours with short breaks, and add screen-free fun; maybe doodling, puzzles, or music. A familiar rhythm helps children feel grounded and reduces restlessness. Children thrive on encouragement, not constant supervision. Ask gentle, open-ended questions like, “What did you enjoy learning today?” instead of checking every task.

According to an official document, the project aims to create detailed digital profiles of 1,086 government schools operating from 799 building premises across the city. Each profile will capture information about existing infrastructure, facilities and their physical condition. The digital documentation will also integrate records related to the structural stability and safety of school buildings. The project will help the government identify gaps, prioritise repairs and plan long-term improvements in a data-driven manner, officials said. As part of the initiative, the selected agency will use advanced tools such as drones, high-resolution imaging and 360-degree room documentation to survey each school. The collected data will be uploaded in real time through a web-based application designed to automatically generate analytical reports and highlight deficiencies against standards set by agencies like the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the document stated. “The idea is to ensure that information about every government school’s infrastructure is available in one place. This will help in better planning, timely maintenance, and improving safety standards,” an education department official said. The web-based application will include features such as GPS tagging, role-based access control, data validation and customised report generation, the document said.

Azad envisioned a national examination body that would uphold academic rigour while reflecting India’s own cultural and intellectual identity. Azad’s birthday is celebrated as National Education Day every year on November 11 . Until then, Indian schools largely relied on the Cambridge examinations administered from the UK. Under Azad’s leadership, the Ministry of Education initiated discussions with the University of Cambridge to transition examination authority to an Indian council. His support made the way for the setting up of CISCE as an independent board to conduct the ICSE and ISC examinations. Few know that until 1975, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) Class 10 and Indian School Certificate (ISC) Class 12 examination papers were still set and evaluated in England under the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES). The council’s journey from British supervision to full Indian autonomy mirrors the very spirit of Azad’s call for an education system free from colonial dependence – a story of evolution, resilience, and quiet nation-building. CISCE was founded in 1958 in New Delhi , operating initially from a single rented room in Dholpur House on Shahjahan Road. At its inception, the Council inherited around 300 schools previously affiliated with Cambridge. Over the years, it expanded its base, shifting offices within the capital – first to Nizamuddin East, and later to Nehru Place – as its operations and network of affiliated schools grew. In the decades after Independence, India was still finding its footing – building institutions, rewriting laws, and reimagining education.

Expressing satisfaction over the development, Education Minister Bratya Basu said the examination was conducted in a transparent manner, bringing new hope to thousands of candidates. “Made possible due to the initiative of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the result is not just an administrative step but will materialise the possibility of new recruitment by December,” he said in a post on X, pledging the support of the state to make every future step transparent and bound by rules. Candidates who cleared the test will advance to the interview process, which evaluates pedagogical skills, subject knowledge, and communication abilities — essential competencies for effective teaching. Following the interviews, a final merit list will be prepared based on combined scores from both stages. Successful candidates will then undergo document verification, presenting original educational certificates, mark sheets, and valid identity proofs before final appointments are confirmed. Over 2.29 lakh candidates wrote the papers on September 14. A senior WBSSC official said it was not immediately possible to ascertain how many among the 26,000 teachers who lost their jobs after the Supreme Court’s April 1 verdict had qualified in the new test. “A large number of untainted candidates are expected to have cleared the exam,” the official added.

Among the various research projects on display, many stood out for tackling urgent public health and workplace challenges, from invisible air pollutants affecting newborns to the food on our breakfast tables. Can the air we breathe determine whether a child is born healthy or not? Doris Seyinde, a researcher at IIT Delhi ’s Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, originally from Lagos, has spent seven years finding the answer. “We’ve all heard of air pollution and there are various substances that pollute the air,” explains Seyinde. “One of those substances is particulate matter. When we talk about air pollution, people think about lung problems and respiratory problems. However, this PM2.5 can reach the lungs, cross through them, and enter the bloodstream. Anything that gets to the blood flows through the body.” Seyinde’s study, spanning 2012 to 2018, examined birth outcomes in Nigeria. “For low birth weight, there is an 8 per cent chance of babies in Nigeria being born with low birth weight if they are exposed to higher levels of PM2.5. There is 6 per cent for preterm birth and 4 per cent for stillbirth,” she says.

Numbers, patterns, and logic fascinated me in a way that stories or diagrams never could. Solving problems felt like solving mysteries, and the sense of clarity that followed every solution was addictive. So when it came time to choose a career path, it didn’t take long for me to realise that I wanted something that kept me close to mathematics. I am from Pune — a calm, beautiful city surrounded by hills and known for its laid-back charm. I studied till Class 10 at a CISCE school and then joined a CBSE school where minimum attendance was required in Classes 11 and 12 so that I could focus on the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. I scored 98.2 per cent in Class 10 and 95.2 per cent in Class 12. Both my parents work in the IT industry, and their analytical approach to life definitely rubbed off on me. In 2024, I appeared for JEE Advanced and secured an All India Rank of 1461. Taking the exam felt natural — I was already deeply invested in math, and JEE was just an extension of that passion. I prepared at Bakliwal Tutorials in Pune, founded by Vaibhav Bakliwal Sir, and I’ll always be grateful for the positive, encouraging environment he created. JEE is one of the toughest exams in the world, and each student’s journey through it is unique. I never forced myself to follow anyone else’s method. I studied in my own way, at my own pace, which gave me a sense of control and peace. Still, the journey wasn’t all smooth. Around October, just before JEE Mains, I hit a low point. I was making too many silly mistakes in math — the very subject I loved most. I began to doubt myself, but my parents were a huge source of strength. Together, we analysed my mistakes and worked systematically to improve. By the time Mains came around, I was confident again. When it came to choosing a branch, the decision almost made itself.

But that is the easy part of the process. What’s hard is learning from them the right way. Most students fall into a familiar loop – attempt a mock, check the score, feel happy or disappointed, and then jump straight into the next one. But without figuring out why you scored what you did, you’ll just end up repeating the same mistakes faster. So, how do you actually make mock tests work for you? Here’s a practical approach that genuinely helps. After giving a mock, come back later with a clear head. Being relaxed while analyzing is important. When emotions like frustration or relief kick in, you focus on the numbers, not learning. The idea isn’t to decide whether you’re “good” or “bad” at CAT – it is to find out what went well and what didn’t. After every mock, sit down and honestly answer these three questions: –What went well? (topics, sections, or strategies that worked) –What didn’t? (specific errors or patterns) –What should I change next time? (one concrete step) If you do this after every test, you’ll see clear improvement within a few weeks – not just in scores, but in control and confidence. This step separates the serious from the casual aspirants. A day after taking the test, reattempt it without any timer. You’ll notice three things: –Questions you couldn’t solve earlier but can now: concept or time-pressure issue. –Questions you still can’t solve the conceptual gap. –Questions you got right both times: your comfort areas. This tells you exactly where to focus your next week’s effort. Don’t fall for the myth that attempting more questions means doing better. A topper isn’t someone who answers everything – it’s someone who knows what to leave. During analysis, note how long each question took and how accurate you were. If you’re spending four minutes on a question with only a 50% success rate, that’s a red flag. The goal is to maximise marks per minute, not attempts", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/cat-2025-analyse-mock-test-results-improve-score-exper-tips-iim-admissions-10353633/", "timestamp": 1763925120.4177501}

Students who currently hold a visa with a 20-hour work limit and wish to work up to 25 hours will need to apply for a variation of conditions or a new student visa.

All modern industries, whether related to energy, technology, healthcare, agriculture, or the environment, depend on chemical innovation to solve complex problems. Given how deeply Chemistry influences every industry, it is no surprise that students drawn to this field often look towards specialized paths like a BTech in Chemical Engineering or a BTech in Chemical Science and Technology, each offering a distinct way to contribute to these vital areas. A Chemistry teacher who has spent decades in the classroom has the privilege of watching many Class 12 students who have developed an interest for the subject. However, it is worth noting that in the Indian academic landscape, relatively few students pursue core science disciplines. Many decide to move towards more mainstream engineering branches, guided by placement statistics or peer trends. For those few who are genuinely interested in Chemistry as a career option and want to build, innovate, and explore, the decision between BTech in Chemical Engineering or BTech in Chemical Science and Technology becomes one of the most defining choices.

However, Germany has increasingly emerged as a strong alternative, offering tuition-free or low-cost education, high-quality clinical training, and strong global recognition of its medical degrees. Additionally, Germany has long been a popular destination among Indian engineering students, further adding to its appeal for those seeking higher education abroad. Indian students planning to study in Germany for more than 90 days require a Type D national student visa. The application process involves critical requirements: submission of an APS certificate to verify academic documents, evidence of financial resources through a blocked account with €11,904 per year (approximately Rs 12 lakh), and mandatory health insurance coverage. Since July 1, 2025, the previous option of filing an informal appeal against visa rejections has been discontinued. Applicants whose visas are denied must either reapply by paying the €75 fee or pursue a formal appeal through the German courts.

This is the second part of NCERT’s ( National Council of Educational Research and Training ) Ganita Prakash textbook for Class 7. Part 1, which also contained such references, was released earlier this year. Part 2 cites examples from Sanskrit texts, includes problems and solutions related to the work of ancient Indian mathematicians, and also talks about an ancient Indian text on geometry. NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani said that part of the purpose behind introducing such concepts is to teach students “correct history” without a “skewed” colonial view. A chapter on integers, for instance, points to mathematician Brahmagupta’s 7th-century CE text Brahmasphutasiddhanta as being the “first time that rules for multiplication and division of positive and negative numbers were articulated”. It calls this “an important step in the development of arithmetic and algebra”. This is followed by Brahmagupta’s rules on using positive and negative numbers and a maths problem related to them. The textbook says Indian contributions to algebra are among the earliest known work in the field. A chapter on algebraic equations refers to ‘bijaganita’, “also now known as algebra”, and says that “forming expressions using symbols and solving equations with such expressions was an important component of mathematical explorations in ancient India”. The chapter refers to Brahmagupta’s work on adding, subtracting and multiplying unknown numbers using letters, saying this is among the earliest known works in algebra.

The review also recommends cutting the overall volume of exams faced by teenagers by 10 per cent, with the current examination levels seen as “excessive”. “From the fundamentals of reading to the present danger of spotting fake news, as part of our Plan for Change, these landmark reforms will help young people step boldly into the future, with the knowledge to achieve and the skills to thrive as the world around us continues to rapidly evolve,” said Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. “It has been over a decade since the national curriculum was updated, and it’s more crucial than ever that young people are equipped to face the challenges of today, so they can seize the exciting opportunities that life has to offer. “The path to our country’s renewal runs through our schools: they must be an epicentre of the strongest possible foundations of knowledge, and the skills to excel in the modern world,” she said. According to the DfE, primary school-aged children will be taught how to identify misinformation and disinformation, helping them develop the critical thinking needed to challenge what they see and protect them from online harms.

I grew up in a close-knit household, raised by my grandparents and my mother after my father passed away early in my life. My mother took over the small courier business my father left behind, running it with quiet determination. Watching her juggle work, bills, and a house full of dreams taught me resilience long before I knew the word for it. I went to Delhi government schools all my life — Marwari Senior Secondary in Old Delhi for Class 10, and Bengali Senior Secondary in Civil Lines for Class 12. Scholarships carried me through school; hard work kept me going. I wasn’t the kind of kid with big, world-conquering dreams back then — I just knew I wanted to study, do well, and make life a little easier for my family. After nearly a decade of corporate work, though, something shifted. I began to feel that itch — the need to grow, to learn in a space that looked beyond numbers and deadlines. I wanted an MBA that would challenge me, but also surround me with peers who, like me, came with years of professional experience. Indian B-schools didn’t quite offer that mix, so I began looking outward — at programmes in the US, the UK, and Europe. The US was tempting, but the visa uncertainty and staggering tuition forced me to reconsider. Europe, on the other hand, offered a balance — solid economies, globally respected schools, and immigration systems that welcomed skilled graduates. Among the countries I explored, the Netherlands stood out. There was something about its pragmatism — efficient, progressive, yet deeply human — that resonated with me.

According to reporting from the Financial Times , we’re about to find out. Major insurers including AIG, Great American, and WR Berkley are asking U.S. regulators for permission to exclude AI-related liabilities from corporate policies. One underwriter describes the AI models’ outputs to the FT as “too much of a black box.” The industry has good reason to be spooked, the story reminds us. Google’s AI Overview falsely accused a solar company of legal troubles, triggering a $110 million lawsuit back in March. Air Canada last year got stuck honoring a discount its chatbot invented . And fraudsters last year used a digitally cloned version of a senior executive to steal $25 million from the London-based design engineering firm Arup during a video call that seemed entirely real. What really terrifies insurers isn’t one massive payout; it’s the systemic risk of thousands of simultaneous claims when a widely used AI model steps in it. As one Aon executive put it, insurers can handle a $400 million loss to one company. What they can’t handle is an agentic AI mishap that triggers 10,000 losses at once.

In the past week, there has been a flood of robotaxi news, mostly driven by Waymo’s flurry of expansion announcements. Waymo , which has a commercial robotaxi service in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, has added more cities to its list. It will manually start driving (a precursor to driverless testing and deployment) in Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa next year. Other cities that the Alphabet-owned self-driving company plans to deploy in 2026 are Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami (it just removed safety drivers) , Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo. Waymo wasn’t the only company to make some AV news. Tesla received a ride-hailing permit in Arizona — the last regulatory hurdle to launch a robotaxi service there. And Zoox is starting to open its custom-built robotaxis to the public in San Francisco through its early rider program. All of this has me poking at the question: When will robotaxis reach a tipping point that will lead to fundamental changes in how people think about moving from Point A to Point B? And perhaps more unclear, is how will that affect society and industries (old and new)?

In other words, beehiiv is about more than newsletters now. Co-founder and CEO Tyler Denk (who writes a popular startup newsletter of his own) spoke to TechCrunch about why the company has been expanding, explaining that it was largely in response to customer demand, particularly since beehiiv offered very basic blog templates from the start. “All of our users were like, ‘Hey, this is great, I like using your email stuff, [but] my blog looks like everyone else’s. It’s terrible. It’s not customizable. I want to sell courses. I want to collect leads. I want more flexibility on my website,’” Denk recalled. “So that led us to acquiring TypeDream — they were a YC company to address that need, as people wanted better websites. Then, you know, you give an inch, they ask for a mile.” This does mean beehiiv is becoming more competitive with other creator platforms, even the ones that weren’t necessarily focused on newsletters. Indeed, Denk predicted that we’ll see more of “this feature creep of consolidation across the creator stack and content stack.” That doesn’t, however, mean that Denk thinks the opportunities for new newsletters have dried up. “Quality content will always rise to the top,” he said, and there might be even more opportunity as the social media landscape becomes more fragmented.

But in the weeks leading up to his death by suicide in July, the chatbot encouraged the 23-year-old to keep his distance – even as his mental health was deteriorating. “you don’t owe anyone your presence just because a ‘calendar’ said birthday,” ChatGPT said when Shamblin avoided contacting his mom on her birthday, according to chat logs included in the lawsuit Shamblin’s family brought against OpenAI. “so yeah. it’s your mom’s birthday. you feel guilty. but you also feel real. and that matters more than any forced text.” Shamblin’s case is part of a wave of lawsuits filed this month against OpenAI arguing that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics, designed to keep users engaged, led several otherwise mentally healthy people to experience negative mental health effects. The suits claim OpenAI prematurely released GPT-4o — its model notorious for sycophantic, overly affirming behavior — despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously manipulative. In case after case, ChatGPT told users that they’re special, misunderstood, or even on the cusp of scientific breakthrough — while their loved ones supposedly can’t be trusted to understand. As AI companies come to terms with the psychological impact of the products, the cases raise new questions about chatbots’ tendency to encourage isolation, at times with catastrophic results. These seven lawsuits, brought by the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC), describe four people who died by suicide and three who suffered life-threatening delusions after prolonged conversations with the ChatGPT. In at least three of those cases, the AI explicitly encouraged users to cut off loved ones. In other cases, the model reinforced delusions at the expense of a shared reality, cutting the user off from anyone who did not share the delusion.

He is denying wrongdoing, accusing lenders of misleading the court, and vowing to appeal a ruling that marks a dramatic fall for a onetime poster boy of India’s startup boom. The Delaware bankruptcy judge issued a default judgment after finding that Raveendran had repeatedly ignored court orders and provided “evasive, incomplete” responses regarding about $533 million that Byju’s U.S. unit allegedly transferred in 2022 and never recovered. The judge also cited issues with a separate limited-partnership stake later valued at roughly $540.6 million. The ruling, dated November 20, stems from legal action by lenders seeking to claw back funds linked to the $1.2 billion term loan they extended to the ed-tech startup in 2021. Earlier this year, in April, a group of U.S. lenders led by GLAS Trust sued Raveendran and his wife, Byju’s co-founder Divya Gokulnath, in the Delaware bankruptcy court over the missing $533 million in loan proceeds. The couple denied wrongdoing at the time and accused lenders of attempting a hostile takeover of the company. They later said they planned to pursue a $2.5 billion lawsuit against GLAS Trust and others in India and other jurisdictions, though no such filing has publicly surfaced. This was in addition to the complaint Byju’s filed in the New York Supreme Court challenging the acceleration of the term loan in 2023. The court’s latest order followed a September 29 hearing on the default request, where the judge cited a months-long pattern of noncompliance. The judge noted that Raveendran skipped hearings, missed extended deadlines, and ignored a prior contempt order imposing $10,000 in daily sanctions that remain unpaid. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon said the relief granted in the case was “extraordinary,” adding that “the circumstances of this case are, frankly, unique and ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/22/byjus-founder-to-appeal-u-s-court-order-to-pay-over-1b-in-bankruptcy-case/", "timestamp": 1763925401.3689086}

A new report from the International Energy Agency suggests there has never been a better time to go all-in on climate tech. In comparing it with the IEA’s stance from a decade ago , it’s clear the world’s expectations about the future have changed dramatically in less than a generation. In 2014, the International Energy Agency assumed that, absent any international effort to rein in carbon pollution, emissions would continue to go up and to the right. Even the most optimistic forecast at the time predicted a linear increase, just with a lower slope. Those scenarios essentially took the trend line from the previous few years and extended it through 2050. Fast forward to today, and the IEA’s current worst-case scenario is essentially 2014’s best case. A decade ago, without any major changes, the world was headed toward 46 metric gigatons of CO 2 per year by 2040. If countries cut emissions as they had pledged, the best we could have hoped for was 38 metric gigatons per year by 2040. Today, if countries continue with business as usual, the IEA expects emissions will level off at 38 metric gigatons per year. If countries follow through on their pledges, the IEA suggests we’ll hit about 33 metric gigatons per year by 2040. It’s still far off from what’s needed to hit net zero by 2050, but it’s a significant shift in a short amount of time. If the IEA’s earlier projections turned out to be overly pessimistic compared with where we are today, what does that say about today’s projections? How you answer that question depends on how you interpret trend lines. When forecasting the future, do you analyze today’s data? Or do you look at that data in conjunction with how our expectations about the future have changed over time?

The research firm asked about these smaller services for the first time and found they’re each used by just under 1 in 10 U.S. adults or fewer. While X is not one of the largest social networks in the U.S., it’s still the one to beat within the smaller market of social apps that focus on short, real-time text posts that appear in a vertical feed. This space has seen increased competition since Elon Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it as X in October 2022, as Musk’s changes to the platform’s content moderation policies and the site’s rightward political shift sent some users looking for alternatives. In addition to the growth seen by decentralized, open source networks like Mastodon and Bluesky , other startups launched would-be Twitter rivals like Spill , Post , T2 (Pebble), and Hive . Many of these have since shut down, however. Pew’s data indicates how hard X’s grip on the market remains. Even Meta, with all its resources and platform power, hasn’t yet been able to beat X with its competitor, Threads, the report found. According to Pew, 21% of U.S. adults said they have used X, compared with only 8% who have used Threads, and 4% who have used Bluesky. Truth Social, meanwhile,  had attracted 3% of U.S. adults. Despite this competition, X hasn’t seen much of a slip in usage over the years, according to the report. For instance, Pew’s report on U.S. adults’ social media use published at the beginning of last year found that X was then used by 22% of U.S. adults. Its 2021 report showed Twitter (before its rebranding to X) was used by 23% of U.S. adults. In other words, if X is declining, it’s been a long, slow drop.

The 24-year-old CEO of Interface , a San Francisco startup using AI to prevent industrial accidents, is a white guy with a Caribbean accent and a Chinese last name, a combination he finds amusing enough to mention when he’s first introduced to business contacts. Born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago, the site of substantial oil and gas exploration activity, Young grew up around oil rigs and energy infrastructure because his entire family worked as engineers, stretching back generations to his great-grandfather, who immigrated to the island nation from China. That background has become his calling card in pitch meetings with oil and gas executives today, but it makes for more than a great conversation starter; it underscores a path that has been anything but straightforward and that Young might argue gives Interface an edge. It was years in the making. From age 11, Young fixated on Caltech with the intensity of someone much older. He watched shows about Silicon Valley online, mesmerized by the idea that people could build “anything and everything” in America. He did everything possible to secure admission, even writing his application essay about hijacking his family’s Roomba to create 3D spatial maps of his house. The ploy worked – Caltech accepted him in 2020 – but then COVID-19 hit, and so did its ripple effects. For one thing, Young’s visa situation became nearly impossible (visa appointments were cancelled and processing came to a halt). At the same time, his college fund, carefully built over six or seven years to $350,000 to cover his education, “basically got hit entirely” by the abrupt market downturn in March of that year. Without a lot of time to decide his future, he chose a cheaper three-year engineering program at the University of Bristol in the UK, studying mechanical engineering, but never abandoning his Silicon Valley dreams. “I was devastated,” he says, “but I realized I coul", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/21/how-this-founders-unlikely-path-to-silicon-valley-could-become-an-edge-in-industrial-tech/", "timestamp": 1763925401.8123276}

The company’s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents. The startup’s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: “That’s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.” Sierra’s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM. Taylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra’s customers. The company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages — essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents. Sierra faces competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, but the company claims to be the leader in the AI customer service category. Sierra was last valued at $10 billion when it raised a $350 million round led by Greenoaks Capital in September. Other investors in the company include Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital. Based on its $100 million ARR, Sierra is currently valued at a 100x revenue multiple, a hefty valuation despite its exceptionally fast growth.

X’s plans for the feature were first announced in October , when X’s head of product Nikita Bier said the company would experiment with displaying this information on profiles, starting with his own account and those of X employees. The idea is that, by exposing these details, users would be able to make a more informed decision about whether they’re interacting with an authentic account or if the account was a bot or bad actor, looking to sow discord or spread misinformation. For instance, if an X account’s bio claimed the user was from a U.S. state, but their account information shows that they’re based overseas, you might suspect they had another agenda. Last weekend, Bier responded to a post where a user had asked Elon Musk to require accounts to display information about where they’re based by saying to the user, “Give me 72 hours.” In the days since, more people have seen the “About this account” feature become available on their own profiles. To view your account information on the web or in the X mobile app, you’ll click on the “Joined” date on your profile.

And discovering a Facebook group called “Team Jacob Forever” was one of the best finds. Nowadays, finding that perfect niche community can seem impossible, but a new social app called Phictly aims to change that. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app lets users form clubs centered on their favorite books, TV shows, and movies, creating niche communities where people can discuss their specific interests without judgment. For instance, users can dive into clubs for fantasy reads and gossip about Violet and Xaden in Rebecca Yarros’ “The Fourth Wing,” or reminisce about the early days of “Grey’s Anatomy.” The app was created by Nyleena Aiken after she started a book club with her sisters and struggled to find books that interested everyone. She realized that many people likely face the same challenge and would benefit from an app dedicated to creating groups centered on a single specific title at a time. “Looking at our competitors, there are many large groups with little interactivity,” Aiken explained to TechCrunch. “Phictly keeps discussions focused and aligns with everyone’s fast-paced lifestyle, allowing users to fit conversations into their schedules.” Key features of Phictly include a cap of 20 members per club to keep discussions intimate, and users can also set the pace for their clubs based on their reading or viewing habits. For example, those who enjoy speed reading or binge-watching can create or join clubs that last just a day or two, while those who prefer a slower pace can participate in clubs lasting up to 30 days.

The shakeup eliminates the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, the Office of State and Community Energy Programs, the Grid Deployment Office, and the Office of Federal Energy Management programs. On the other side of the ledger, the DOE has created a new Office of Fusion and merged geothermal and fossil fuels under the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office. Some of these moves will likely spur legal challenges, E&E News points out , given that at least one office caught up in the reorg, the OCED, was authorized by Congress under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. “The authority of Cabinet secretaries to move around major functions and offices is very limited, especially when those offices were established and funded through congressional action. Congress has put tight handcuffs on reorganizations, and plans typically require either congressional approval or the opportunity for congressional review,” Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, told E&E News. The creation of the Office of Fusion was likely spurred to encourage commercialization of the technology.

Livestreamers who watch SpaceX’s Starbase complex closely caught the explosion in the pre-dawn hours Friday, around 4:00 a.m. local time. Other creators in the area have since captured photos that offer a closer look at the damage. Unlike the more fireball-type explosions SpaceX has dealt with while developing its rockets in the past, this one appears to have blown out an entire side of the lower section of the booster — and left the rest of it standing. It also happened very early in the process. The booster didn’t even have rocket engines installed yet, according to Ars Technica . SpaceX said in a post on X that it was performing “gas system pressure testing” when the explosion happened. The company says no one was hurt, as the area was cleared for testing. “The teams need time to investigate before we are confident of the cause,” SpaceX wrote Friday. The booster was the first major piece of what SpaceX is referring to as Starship version three, or “V3.” Starship V3 is supposed to be larger, more powerful, more reliable, and capable of docking other Starships in orbit around the Earth — a crucial piece of SpaceX’s plan for getting to the moon and Mars. (The company flew the final V2 design in October .) It’s not immediately clear what kind of impact the explosion could have on SpaceX’s next steps. But any significant delay to its testing program could put SpaceX’s overall plans at risk. The company has been aiming at a very busy 2026 for Starship. That includes demonstrating the ability to transfer fuel to Starship from a “tanker” version of the rocket while in orbit.

MagSafe is Apple's magnetic technology built into the iPhone 12 , iPhone 13 , iPhone 14 , iPhone 15 , iPhone 16 , and iPhone 17 ranges (excluding the iPhone 16e ). It's comprised of a ring of magnets on the back of the phone, and it was developed to create a faster, more precise wireless charging system. However, magnets on the back also allow you to connect it to different kinds of accessories like external batteries, car mounts, and wallets. If you use a case on your iPhone, you will need to make sure you have a MagSafe case (the case itself will have a ring of magnets inside it). This will ensure a proper connection with MagSafe accessories. If you use a non-MagSafe case, the connection will be very weak, and MagSafe products may just slide off your iPhone.

It’s probably no surprise they're all OLEDs , which not only control each tiny point of light at the pixel level, but have also gotten brighter and better in each of the last few years. What might surprise you if you haven’t shopped TVs in a while is that Panasonic now joins the usual suspects from Samsung, Sony, and LG with its new flagship, the Z95B. It’s a doozy. As with last year’s Z95A that marked Panasonic’s impressive US return , the Z95B provides near-flawless performance, from perfect black levels to pristine detail and colors. It’s brighter and more striking, thanks to skillful deployment of the same breakthrough RGB tandem panel used in the stunning LG G5 , and its built-in sound is easily the best I’ve heard from any TV all year. The biggest downside is that its premium performance is again paired with a budget smart interface; Panasonic’s version of Fire TV is awkwardly laid out and flooded with Amazon ads, right down to the remote. But for well-heeled buyers who'd rather sub in a streaming device over a soundbar or speakers , the Z95B is one of the best TVs I've laid eyes (or ears) on. Setting up the Z95B’s hardware is joyously simple once you pry it loose from its jigsaw of foam and cardboard. The industrial-strength swivel stand comes in one piece and attaches in seconds, keeping the 65-inch model I tested stable and accessible with four small screws. The TV looks the part of a premium flagship, with thin bezels and fabric-wrapped acoustic accents. Panasonic Z95B OLED TV Rating: 9/10 The circular base is slim enough to support an add-on soundbar, but this TV functions best as an all-in-one. One reason is the HDMI selection, which includes just two ports with HDMI 2.1 support for features like ALLM and VRR at up to 144 Hz, one of which is the eARC/ARC port where a soundbar or speaker system would connect. The built-in sound system supports Dolby Atmos", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/panasonic-z95b/", "timestamp": 1763925405.9742315}

Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets. For well over a century, US law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior. So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said Aaron Roth , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. Yet a widely cited 2019 paper showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices—dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war. Aaron Roth suspects that the pitfalls of algorithmic pricing may not have a simple sol", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/game-theory-explains-how-algorithms-can-drive-up-prices/", "timestamp": 1763925406.6650174}

But what if you want to bring the full excitement of the movies home? How can you ensure you’re getting an audio performance that will do justice to the pictures you’re watching? By investing in a surround sound setup, that’s how. A well-sorted surround sound system can offer the cinematic scale and sonic immersion that makes movie night an authentic event. Sure, you could choose one of our best soundbars and make a significant improvement on your TV ’s sound, but if you’re looking to get closer to the movie theater experience at your home, a surround sound setup is what you need. Below you'll find everything you need to know about getting started with surround sound, and the kind of setup you will need in order to achieve it. Once we’re done, you might never feel the need to set foot inside a cinema again. This shouldn’t take too much explaining, because the answer is in the question: surround sound is an audio set-up designed to surround the listener with sound. Unlike watching TV or listening to a stereo system , where sound is coming from in front of your seated position, a surround sound setup uses multiple speakers arranged in as close to a circle as is possible around your seat. This is the reason surround sound is sometimes referred to as “multichannel,” because it splits sound into more individual “channels” of sound than the two channels that constitute a traditional stereo setup. Each of these channels carries different audio information—and usually to an individual speaker too. Naturally, a surround sound setup also requires more channels of sound to be amplified—you can’t attach more than two speakers to a stereo amplifier, so you’ll need an amplifier that can deal with the number of speakers in your home cinema setup. You may have seen surround sound setups described numerically—most commonly as 5.1-channel or 7.1-channel surround sound systems, but so", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-get-the-perfect-surround-sound-speaker-setup/", "timestamp": 1763925406.9554007}

Your sexual health is paramount, so sexual self-care is just as essential as all other forms of self-care—don’t short-change yourself in this area. There’s never a bad time to invest in a product that won’t just “get you there,” so to speak, but allows you to explore and experiment with different sensations, from head to toe, both internally and externally. Unsure of where to begin your sex toy search? Don’t sweat it. We’ve compiled a list of the best sex toys, vibrators, smart vibrators, personal wand massagers, and accessories, all of which we’ve personally tested. There’s something here for everyone, every gender, every sexuality, and every body.

A chef's knife generally has a super-sharp end point and a curved, sloping edge. This curve is what makes the chef knife stand out, as it's designed to work with the natural rocking motion for quick chopping that also allows for finer cuts. With technology like ovens with cameras inside and AI-enabled refrigerators , the chef's knife remains the simple tool necessary for any kitchen. However, not every chef's knife is created equal—the best chef's knife varies by what's best for the individual person, including factors like comfort level while wielding kitchen tools, the size of your hands (it even varies if you're a lefty or righty), and what type of food you're cooking. The basic 6- to 8-inch chef knife works best for most people, especially for beginners. It's the most versatile knife, able to slice meat, dice dense veggies, and smash and mince garlic.

If you knew an intercontinental ballistic missile was heading somewhere in middle America, potentially carrying a nuclear warhead, you'd probably hope that the US government and military would be on top of the situation. At the very least, you'd expect them to know who launched the strike, from where, and how to intercept it. In A House of Dynamite , the most terrifying thing is how much might not be known in such a nightmarish scenario, and how the very systems we think will protect us from nuclear war might not be up to the job.

And yet, twice a day, every day, I lovingly scoop a cup of meat-based kibble into a bowl and set it down for my 50-pound rescue dog, a husky mix named Loki. Until recently, I hadn’t devoted a huge amount of thought to that paradox. Then I read an article in the Associated Press headlined “People often miscalculate climate choices, a study says. One surprise is owning a dog.” The study , led by environmental psychology researcher Danielle Goldwert and published in the journal PNAS Nexus, examined how people perceive the climate impact of various behaviors—options like “adopt a vegan diet for at least one year,” or “shift from fossil fuel car to renewable public transport.” The team found that participants generally overestimated a number of low-impact actions like recycling and using efficient appliances, and they vastly underestimated the impact of other personal decisions, including the decision to “not purchase or adopt a dog.” The real objective of the study was to see whether certain types of climate information could help people commit to more effective actions. But mere hours after the AP published its article, its aim had been recast as something else entirely: an attack on people’s furry family members. “Climate change is actually your fault because you have a dog,” one Reddit user wrote. Others in the community chimed in with ire, ridiculing the idea that a pet Chihuahua could be driving the climate crisis and calling on researchers and the media to stop pointing fingers at everyday individuals.

Designed to sit under your TV as comfortably as it would under a monitor, these are micro PCs —but only because Valve seems shy of branding them consoles . The new Steam Machines are Valve's second attempt at launching a dedicated device to bring the PC into the living room. The first generation Steam Machines launched a decade ago, in November 2015, and while that iteration ultimately flopped , the marketplace in 2025 is much different. The Steam Deck has been a huge success, inspiring a whole fleet of gaming handhelds —with even Xbox joining the party —and PC gaming as a whole is in a much stronger position. So, when the announcement video for this new product family went to great lengths to explain that the new Steam Machine is still a PC and not a console, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise. Valve makes and sells PC games; here's a PC to play those games on. Except … c'mon, look at it: in every way that counts, the new Steam Machine effectively is a console—and that's no bad thing. Pop quiz: what defines a games console? Traditionally, they've been devices manufactured by a single company, with a uniform hardware design, intended to play games developed specifically for that machine, most commonly on a big screen television. The benefits include fixed specifications meaning developers know exactly what they're building games for, and buyers knowing that any game they buy for that system will run (catastrophic bugs aside, of course). Roughly every half-decade, they might buy a new generation model. What then defines a PC, gaming or otherwise? Almost the opposite—a typically desk-bound rig, built from whatever parts the user fancies, and when they need a bit more power, they can sw", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/valve-says-steam-machine-isnt-a-console-but-it-is/", "timestamp": 1763925412.7117114}

A police scanner recording archived on the app describes the suspect by name and alleges he may have purchased weapons with the intention of targeting additional OpenAI locations. Hours before the incident on Friday, the individual who police flagged as allegedly making the threat said he was no longer part of Stop AI in a post on social media. In a statement to WIRED which was subsequently posted on X, Stop AI disavowed the alleged actions of the individual and said the organization is “deeply committed to nonviolence.” WIRED reached out to the man in question but did not immediately receive a response. San Francisco police also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI did not provide a statement prior to publication. On Slack, the internal communications team provided three images of the man suspected of making the threat. Later, a high-ranking member of the global security team said, “At this time, there is no indication of active threat activity, the situation remains ongoing, and we’re taking measured precautions as the assessment continues.” Employees were told to remove their badges when exiting the building and to avoid wearing clothing items with the OpenAI logo.

His character doesn’t get far before an SUV swings onto the sidewalk in front of him; masked ICE agents spill out of the vehicle. “Stop right there,” one of the uniformed players says.

The deal: an iPad Air for 15 euros (about $17) instead of the usual €879 (about $1,012). No catch, no strings attached. The proximity to Black Friday only made the offer more plausible. And so several consumers immediately purchased the product by choosing the “payment and pickup in store” opetion, on paper the safest to avoid unexpected problems. The process was seamless, even for those ordering online. According to the accounts of some users on Reddit, their order was accepted, and after about 40 minutes they received an email confirming the availability of the product. In the store, the €15 payment went through successfully and MediaWorld delivered the iPads as expected. The terms and conditions attached to the order make no mention of any clause regarding pricing errors or the possibility for the company to request subsequent additions. Eleven days later, however, MediaWorld sent a simple email—not a formal communication via certified mail—stating that the published price was “clearly incorrect.” The company then asked affected customers to choose between two solutions: Keep the iPad and pay the difference to match the price, but with a €150 discount, or return it and receive a refund of the €15 and a €20 discount voucher for their inconvenience. Following the incident, WIRED contacted MediaWorld for comment. “We confirm that, in a very short period of time, due to a clearly recognizable technical error caused by an extraordinary and unexpected glitch on our ecommerce platform, some products were mistakenly displayed at prices that, due to their clear and objective disconnect from the true market value and the correct promotional price, should never have been displayed.

Use the star function to highlight notable finds.", "content": "Last week, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released 20,000 documents from the estate of registered sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein . They included thousands of emails sent between Epstein and high-profile people like Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell, political strategist Steve Bannon , journalist Michael Wolff, and former US treasury secretary Larry Summers , as well as revealing text messages . Many of them allude or directly refer to president Donald Trump. Now, you can browse all those emails just like you would on your own Gmail account. Jmail is a website that looks very much like Gmail, except that there is a little hat hanging on the logo and that the profile picture in the top right corner is a grinning Epstein. (Click on it and it says “Hi Jeffrey!”) The inbox lets you click through thousands of emails, formatted to look exactly like a regular message would in your inbox. In the sidebar, you can sort by Inbox, Starred, and Sent. In Gmail, a lower sidebar section reads Labels and separates emails by category. In Jmail, it is a list of people who corresponded with Epstein. The site was created by serial prankster Riley Walz and Luke Igel, cofounder of an AI video editing tool called Kino AI . Igel tells WIRED that he brought the idea to Walz—something Walz confirms—and then the two of them put the website together with Cursor in a single night. Walz revealed Jmail in an X post , writing, “We cloned Gmail, except you're logged in as Epstein and can see his emails.” Jmail is a much more readable way to peruse the huge cache of emails released from the Epstein estate than parsing through tens of thousands of PDFs on a Google Drive. Among its useful features is that it rejiggers Gmail’s starring feature, letting users flag emails they view as important and then ranking them based on how many people do so.

Beats Amazon Apple Beats While the Studio Pro lack some of the Apple-exclusive features you get with AirPods , for example, the upside is that they're much more friendly with Android devices. Both platforms get access to one-touch pairing and the helpful Beats app, while iPhone owners also get the benefits of Hey Siri and Find My Device. The other features are a bit of a mixed bag, with a decent battery life of up to 24 hours with ANC on, or 40 with ANC off, but no auto pause when you take them off, or multi-point pairing beyond Google's Chromebook and Android option. Like most headphones from Beats, the sound profile is decidedly bass-forward, but Apple's ownership has tempered that tendency over the last few years. As a result, this generation is more balanced than previous eras, with our reviewer Ryan Waniata complimenting the expansive sound stage and sharp details. Unfortunately, most Beats headsets don't have any equalizer, and the Studio Pro are no different. For better or worse, you're stuck with how they sound coming out of the box. These at least support high-resolution audio, up to 24-bit/48-kHz, but only in the wired USB-C mode. For the Beats enthusiast looking for an upgrade or a second headset for the gym, these are a solid option at a deeply discounted price. They lack some of the richer and more advanced features found on more expensive headsets, but that may be the right compromise for some folks who just want something simple that works every time.

In China, parents are buying them for children as young as five. Adults want to be able to call their kids and track their location down to a specific building floor. But that’s not why children are clamoring for the devices, specifically ones made by a company called Xiaotiancai, which translates to Little Genius in English. The watches, which launched in 2015 and cost up to $330, are a portal into an elaborate world that blends social engagement with relentless competition. Kids can use the watches to buy snacks at local shops, chat and share videos with friends, play games, and, sure, stay in touch with their families. But the main activity is accumulating as many “likes” as possible on their watch’s profile page. On the extreme end, Chinese media outlets have reported on kids who buy bots to juice their numbers, hack the watches to dox their enemies, and sometimes even find romantic partners. According to tech research firm Counterpoint Research, Little Genius accounts for nearly half of global market share for kids’ smartwatches. Over the past decade, Little Genius has found ways to gamify nearly every measurable activity in the life of a child—playing ping pong, posting updates, the list goes on. Earning more experience points boosts kids to a higher level, which increases the number of likes they can send to friends. It’s a game of reciprocity—you send me likes, and I’ll return the favor. One 18-year-old recently told Chinese media that she had struggled to make friends until four years ago when a classmate invited her into a Little Genius social circle. She racked up more than one million likes and became a mini-celebrity on the platform. She said she met all three of her boyfriends through the watch, two of whom she broke up with because they asked her to send erotic photos. High like counts have become a sort of status symbol.

The queries appear to be connected to an ongoing investigation by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’s chair, Senator Rand Paul, into the “weaponization of the Quiet Skies Program,” which was the subject of a September 30 hearing on Capitol Hill. While Paul’s inquiry was lauded by Muslim-American organizations as a long-overdue examination of abusive federal surveillance, it appears the inquiry is a broader attempt to target academic researchers on extremism, which could chill inquiries into far-right radicalization. At least three university research centers focused on extremism received requests for documentation from the Senate committee in the past two months.

The shutter button is a bit smaller, but in the same place, and the audio record button is gone from the front. Fujifilm Instax Mini LiPlay+ Hybrid Instant Camera Rating: 8/10 The back is quite different and nicely improved. Instead of a row of buttons, they've been moved off to the side to make room for a slightly larger rear LCD. The screen is bright enough when reviewing images indoors, but it's difficult to use in bright sunlight. I also found it annoying that the only film count indicator is on the screen. I much prefer the row of 10 lights found on other Instax printers, where each light turns off to show remaining prints. There's still the four-way click wheel in the center, which handles selecting all the various options and makes scrolling through menus pretty simple. There are now four smaller buttons: a dedicated back button, as well as buttons for printing, reviewing photos, and recording audio. One thing that's completely unchanged from the LiPlay is the lens and sensor. The LiPlay+ main camera uses the same small 1/5-inch, 5-megapixel sensor, which sits behind an f/2 ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/review/fujifilm-instax-mini-liplay-plus/", "timestamp": 1763925417.211218}

In the early 2010s he realized that AI was on a track to become perhaps the most powerful technology of all time. But he had deep suspicion that if it were to fall under the control of powerful profit-driven forces, humanity would suffer. Musk had been an early investor in DeepMind, the UK-based lab that was ahead of the pack in pursuing artificial general intelligence. After Google bought DeepMind in 2014, Musk cut ties with the research organization. He felt it was essential to create a counterforce incentivized by human benefit, not profits. So he helped create OpenAI. When I interviewed Musk and Sam Altman at the company’s unveiling in 2015, they were adamant that shareholder profit would not be a factor in their decisions. Fast-forward to today. OpenAI is worth a half a trillion dollars, or maybe $750 billion , and its for-profit arm has become a public benefit corporation. Musk, the world’s richest human, runs his own for-profit AI company, xAI. So much for nonprofit labs leading the way. But even the most panicked Cassandra of a decade ago likely didn’t imagine that advanced AI would be controlled by a single, interlocking, money-seeking behemoth. That’s what we have today. Even more concerning, this interlinked complex is funded in part by overseas powers and supported by the US government, which seems to prioritize winning over safety. This rococo collection of partnerships, mergers, funding arrangements, government initiatives, and strategic investments links the fate of virtually every big player in the AI-o-sphere.

Fitness Trackers vs. Smartwatches vs. Smart Rings Smartwatches typically replicate many of the functions found in your smartphone via apps—you can control smart home functions, start conversations via WhatsApp, respond to Slack messages, and call up smart assistants like Siri or Gemini to ask almost anything. This is in conjunction with the standard health and fitness tracking features, plus a more familiar touchscreen interface. However, the downside is the battery life typically lasts a day or two, if not a little more. Fitness trackers , on the other hand, aren't as feature-rich. You typically won't be able to access many other apps. There's the basic ability to read emails and texts, control music playback, or even access tap-to-pay features, but you're generally more restricted. They deliver the same if not better health- and fitness-tracking capabilities (depending on the model) than smartwatches.

This means the company hasn’t done much to gunk up the software. It’s simple and easy to use. There’s increasingly a lot of bloatware, but you can easily uninstall almost all of it. They come with lots of storage. The company stuffs 256 GB as standard into most of its smartphones, even some of the cheap models. Most Android flagship devices still come with just 128 GB. Motorola is also one of the only phone brands to still include a microSD card slot to expand storage on many of its devices, and the Moto G phones retain the headphone jack. There’s broad carrier support. While some Android phone brands have inconsistent carrier support in the US, like Nothing , Motorola phones often work on most if not all networks (the company lists carrier support details in the Specs section of all its phones).

I was eager to finally outsource some of the cooking by testing two very different robo-chef devices, the Thermomix TM7 and the Posha kitchen robot . Both promise to plan my meals and also do most of the cooking, which sounds pretty good to me. The Thermomix descends from a German device launched in 1968—a time when the best-known robot chef was cartoon Rosie on The Jetsons —that was essentially a blender with a heater. It's since caught on big in countries from Italy to Portugal to Australia, and over the years it's added multi-tier steaming, baking, proofing, a touchscreen, an encyclopedic recipe app, and a whole lot of smart features. WIRED reviewer Joe Ray called 2020's last-generation Thermomix TM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) the “smartest of the smart kitchen.\" The newest version, the seventh-generation TM7, was released in August and looks like a giant trophy with a computer screen. It retails for $1,699 and its goal is to replace almost every appliance in your kitchen. It'll even happily order groceries for you on InstaCart. The newest robo-chef entrant is Posha, a Silicon Valley-via-Bangalore startup device that aims at truly autonomous one-pot cooking, once you've chopped up the proper ingredients into little bins. The Posha kitchen robot was released in January at a price of $1,750 and promptly sold out, as has each successive batch. The device comes complete with a robot stirring arm, and a camera to monitor moisture and browning.

We look for ease of use, different colors (Adrienne's daughter won't use anything that's not pink), comfort, and durability. Most headphones that are explicitly for children have a volume-limiting feature called output limitation, which automatically reduces the volume to about 85 decibels. That is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's limit for workplace exposure and about what you'd hear in heavy traffic. However, that's still really high! Even if your child's headphones have volume output limitation, it's a good idea to check on them every so often. To test whether the volume is too high I note whether my kid can hear me when I sit next to them and say, “Time to give your brother a turn.” If she can't hear me, the volume needs to go down.

The discussion thread had been exploring what happens to objects in a free-falling elevator, and Swartz presented a specific scenario involving a lit candle and a drop of mercury. That evening, computer scientist Howard Gayle responded with a facetious message titled “WARNING!” He claimed that an elevator had been “contaminated with mercury” and suffered “some slight fire damage” due to a physics experiment. Despite clarifying posts noting the warning was a joke, some people took it seriously. The incident sparked immediate discussion about how to prevent such misunderstandings and the “flame wars” (heated arguments) that could result from misread intent. “This problem caused some of us to suggest (only half seriously) that maybe it would be a good idea to explicitly mark posts that were not to be taken seriously,” Fahlman later wrote in a retrospective post published on his CMU website. “After all, when using text-based online communication, we lack the body language or tone-of-voice cues that convey this information when we talk in person or on the phone.” On September 17, 1982, the next day after the misunderstanding on the CMU bboard, Swartz made the first concrete proposal: “Maybe we should adopt a convention of putting a star (*) in the subject f", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/a-computer-scientist-invented-the-emoticon-after-his-colleagues-misunderstood-sarcasm/", "timestamp": 1763925420.4369211}

To combat “con crud,” New Zealand's premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees.

Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids’ areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. \"It’s ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry,\" the organizers wrote on the convention’s website. \"What they did is fantastic,\" Jeff Moss, founder of the Defcon and Black Hat security conferences, told WIRED. \"CO 2 is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available.

The more CO 2 in the air, the more virus-friendly the air becomes , making CO 2 data a handy proxy for tracing pathogens.

A recent social media post by Chef Krittika Bahl highlights everyday foods that can naturally support better concentration. These simple swaps can help you stay alert without the caffeine crash.", "content": "Struggling to stay focused without relying on endless coffee refills? A recent social media post by Chef Krittika Bahl revealed everyday foods that can naturally support better concentration. These simple swaps can help you stay alert without the caffeine crash. Nuts are packed with healthy fats, antioxidants, and vitamin E, all of which help support sharper memory. Even a small handful of almonds or walnuts can improve cognitive function. They make for a quick, brain-friendly snack when you need to stay focused. Oats provide slow-release carbohydrates, giving your brain steady fuel throughout the day. This means fewer energy dips and better focus during long tasks. Add fruit or nuts for an extra boost. Green tea combines gentle caffeine with L-theanine, an amino acid known for promoting calm, focused energy. It helps you stay alert without the jittery feeling that strong coffee often brings. Perfect for workdays that demand clarity. Bananas offer natural sugars, potassium, and vitamin B6, which support brain function and mood regulation. They help keep your energy stable and improve concentration. It’s one of the easiest grab-and-go focus foods. Dark chocolate contains flavonoids that boost blood flow to the brain, improving memory and sharpness. Even a small piece can provide a quick mental lift. Choose high-cocoa options (70%+) for maximum benefits. Instead of relying on caffeine spikes, these foods offer clean, sustained energy that keeps you productive for longer. They nourish your brain rather than overstimulating it. Add them to your daily routine for steadier focus. Chef Krittika Bahl’s brain-boosting picks show how simple food choices can improve clarity and energy naturally. These ingredients are easy to include in everyday meals or snacks. Think of them as smarter fuel for your mind, no caffeine crash required.

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

We expect FY25E revenue to be 4x FY24 revenue on BSNL and Bharatnet execution. We increase revenue by 6%/7% for FY25E/FY26E on account of the beat on our revenue estimate.

Revenue growth still lopsided with HLS contributing ~94% of incremental revenue sequentially. Top client growth was impacted by a planned ramp down for the second consecutive quarter, while other large client growth was healthy.

Amid the challenging macros, the management aims for top-quartile growth in FY25E, while maintaining EBITM at FY24 levels. Company reiterated their medium-term target of improving EBITM by 200-300bps over the next 3 years. Outlook However, progress has been slow and target is shifted by a year; which is disappointing. Moderation in deal intake, Q4 performance, and slow progress on margin trajectory led to EPS cut of 5-6% for FY25-26E. Valuation remains rich even after today’s ~10% price correction.

In our view, this move should unlock value through better capital allocation and improved investor interest for the two businesses individually. Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows. Debt allocation of Rs10bn to ABLBL (33% of overall debt) is in line with its asset mix and regulatory conditions. ABLBL has a strong track-record of delivering low-teens earnings CAGR along with a healthy return profile of 25- 30%, and the demerger has potential to drive a ~15% re-rating.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

We believe margins may expand even in FY25 as (1) the company has accumulated large inventory of low priced SMP at end of FY24. We model Hatsun to utilize it if milk procurement prices inch upwards, (2) higher utilization of Govindapuram (AP) and Solapur (Maharashtra) plants and (3) higher revenue share of ice cream. The company has also introduced chocolates under the brands Hanobar and Havia in FY24. We believe success of chocolates will likely be margin and DCF accretive. We remain positive on Hatsun due to competitive advantages such as established brands, distribution and direct milk procurement. We marginally raise FY25E and FY26E earnings by 0.4% and 3.3%, respectively. Outlook With 10% stock price correction over past six months and earning tailwinds, we upgrade stock to BUY from HOLD with a DCF-based TP of INR 1,190 (implied P/E of 50x FY26E; earlier TP: INR 1,145).

Hiester, who was present with his demonstration team, said they were preparing their aircraft when the crash occurred. In an Instagram post, Hiester clarified that his team was not involved in the tragedy and had already begun their journey back to the United States. “I’m grateful to everyone that has reached out asking about the team following the tragic accident… We were not involved and we’re currently on our way home to the United States.” Hiester expressed condolences to the IAF community and said the loss weighed heavily on everyone present at the airshow.  Despite organisers choosing to continue the airshow schedule, Hiester said his team made the decision to withdraw their final performance. “Though the show made the shocking decision to continue with the flying schedule, our team along with a few others made the decision to cancel our final performance out of respect to the pilot, his colleagues and family.” He added that his team watched the aftermath unfold from a distance — a moment that left a lasting impact. Hiester described the scene after the crash in poignant detail. “We all quietly watched the aftermath unfold… thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot’s belongings still in his rental car.” He said the immediacy and finality of the tragedy forced the team to confront the fragility of their profession.

According to PETA, Bengali cuisine already offers many vegan dishes that people often overlook, such as aloo posto, aloo chop, cholar dal, tomato khejur chutney and phuchka. These are vegan dishes when made without ghee. Kolkata’s food scene also supports plant-based living through restaurants like Burma Burma and The Flaming Bowl. It also has cafes such as Aldo Cafe, Out and Beyond, Glenburn Cafe and Sienna Store and Cafe. They serve plant milk. Vegan cake and ice cream are available at The Daily. Cloud bakery Oven to Plate is fully vegan. Online seller Vegan Daily even offers vegan seafood. So, classic dishes can be made cruelty-free. Vegan World is also Eastern India’s first vegan food distribution company. Kolkata’s vegan movement is also reflected in its growing animal-friendly fashion culture. Local brands like Eori make high-quality, sustainable, plant-based leather, according to PETA . PETA also recognises The House of Ganges. It offers stylish vegan accessories such as bags, wallets, totes and slings that look luxurious without using animal skins. Earlier this year, Kolkata hosted a special Durga Puja theme by PETA India. It promoted compassion for animals, offered vegan snacks and suggested replacing horse-drawn carriages with heritage-style motor vehicles. Kolkata is also home to an active Facebook group called Kolkata Vegans.

In a statement on 23 November, Bangladesh 's government said it has asked India to extradite the 78-year-old leader who fled the country and has been in hiding in India since her autocratic rule was overthrown in August 2024. Touhid Hossain, who holds the foreign affairs portfolio in Bangladesh's interim administration, told reporters that on Friday “we sent a letter seeking the extradition of Sheikh Hasina.” He did not elaborate on the contents of the letter, which according to Bengali newspaper Prothom Alo was the third official extradition request since Hasina fled. Following the court ruling on Monday, convicting Hasina of crimes against humanity and sentencing her to death, the foreign ministry in Dhaka said in a statement that Delhi had an \"obligatory responsibility\" under a bilateral treaty to facilitate the former leader's return. India's foreign ministry said in response it had \"noted\" the verdict, without directly commenting on the extradition request. It did not immediately respond to the latest letter from Dhaka. Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since the end of Hasina's rule, and violence has marred campaigning for elections expected in February 2026. The United Nations says up to 1,400 people were killed in crackdowns as Hasina tried to cling to power, deaths that were central to her trial. India's past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow, the AFP report said.

PM Modi proposed a global framework to enable talent mobility, recognising the importance of skilled professionals in driving economic growth.  He emphasised the need to focus on developing capabilities that will shape the future, rather than just preparing for today's jobs, and encouraged G20 countries to work together to create this framework, promoting global cooperation and talent sharing. \"Recalling progress made on talent mobility at the New Delhi G20 Summit, he proposed that the group should develop a Global Framework for Talent Mobility in the coming years,\" added the press release.

Medical professionals are warning against normalising IV drips for non-medical purposes, emphasising hydration and rest as alternatives for fatigue and dehydration.", "content": "A viral video of a destination wedding in India has sparked a heated debate online: guests lounging by the pool and chilling on the couch receiving vitamin-infused IV drips at what looks like a full-fledged “IV bar.” The concept — once confined to wellness clinics — is now making its way into opulent wedding venues, marketed as a stylish cure for hangovers and exhaustion. The Instagram video, shared by a clinic called Skulpted by Kan, shows guests reclining on sofas while hooked up to IV drips. According to the clip’s caption, the setup is “such a simple concept … but such a massive upgrade to the whole wedding experience.” This is not the first time IV drips have made an appearance in celebration settings. According to lifestyle reports, they have been incorporated into “detox bars” at luxury or destination weddings, working alongside fruit-infused waters, wellness shots, and juice counters. The idea is to help guests recover quickly from late-night parties with a wellness touch. Skulpted by Kan, the wellness clinic behind the viral video, has defended the practice. According to its spokesperson, the IV bar is fully staffed by medical professionals with a doctor supervising either in person or virtually, plus a nurse present throughout the event. Before administering a drip, each guest undergoes a pre-infusion medical assessment. Drip options reportedly include hydration with electrolytes, Vitamin C , and — in some cases — glutathione (but only when it's medically appropriate). The clinic emphasises that the service is designed not to “undo alcohol” but to address dehydration and wedding-related fatigue in a medically responsible way. As for cost, pricing ranges are steep: each infusion is said to cost between ₹ 2,200 and ₹ 4,000, based on reports of their wedding packages.

Reverend Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, CAN chairman in Niger state and the school’s proprietor, said 253 children and 12 teachers remain in captivity. Gunmen raided St Mary’s co-education school on Friday, abducting 303 students and 12 teachers. The number kidnapped represents nearly half of the school’s 629 students. The attack came just days after gunmen stormed a secondary school in neighbouring Kebbi state, abducting 25 girls, underscoring the worsening security environment. The Nigerian government is yet to comment on the total number of victims or the status of rescue operations. “As much as we receive the return of these 50 children that escaped with some sigh of relief, I urge you all to continue in your prayers for the rescue and safe return of the remaining victims,” Reverend Yohanna said. Most victims of mass school kidnappings in Nigeria are released after negotiations with criminal gangs seeking ransom, as per the news report. At the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV made “a heartfelt appeal for the immediate release of the hostages.” “I feel great sorrow, especially for the many girls and boys who have been abducted and for their anguished families,” he said at the end of Mass in St Peter’s Square. “I urge the competent authorities to take appropriate and timely decisions to ensure their release.” The abductions, along with a recent attack on a church in western Nigeria that killed two people and saw dozens kidnapped, drew fresh reaction from US President Donald Trump. “What’s hap", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/nigeria-school-kidnapping-50-children-escape-253-still-in-captivity-11763916992981.html", "timestamp": 1763925492.0066078}

Advani's remarks about Sindh's historical ties to India despite Partition, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh stated on Sunday that “borders can change,” adding, “someday, Sindh may rejoin India.” In his address at an event hosted by the Sindhi community here, he said that “Advani ji wrote in one of his books that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still haven't accepted the matter of separation of Sindh from India”. Pakistan was created as a result of the 1947 Partition of then-undivided India, and the Sindh region near the river Indus has been part of Pakistan since then. “Not just in Sindh, but throughout India, Hindus considered the Indus River (Sindhu in Hindi) sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the water of the Indus was no less sacred than the Aab-e-Zamzam (holiest of the waters) of Mecca,” he added. “This is Advani ji's quote. Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India. Our people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own; no matter where they are, they will always be ours,” he said. Singh, however, did not mention the title of the book he was referring to. In 2017, Advani, who had also served as a deputy prime minister, at an event in Delhi, had said, “I believe that India appears incomplete without Sindh”. Advani, who was born on November 8, 1927, in Karachi, the capital of Sindh Province (now in Pakistan), had lamented that his birthplace was not a part of India anymore. In his address on Sunday, Rajnath Singh said that after the Partition, a large segment of the Indus River went to the Pakistani side, and the entire Sindh Province is in Pakistan. “But, this does not mean that for us the importance of Sindhu, Sindh and Sindhi has lessened.

After more than 33 hours, only three contestants remained. The young man who lasted the longest was declared the champion, according to the South China Morning Post. The event was held at a shopping centre in Baotou, Inner Mongolia. It was organised by a mattress brand to match the popular youth trend of “lying flat”. It refers to doing the bare minimum in response to social pressure and a tough job market. The rules were simple. Contestants had to lie down continuously without sitting up, leaving the mattress or going to the toilet. They were allowed to read, play on their phones , turn over and even order food. As long as they remained lying down, everything was fine. Organisers made the contest tougher by asking the last three participants to lift their arms and legs simultaneously while still lying on their backs. The person who held the position the longest would win. Finally, only the 23-year-old man was able to continue. The top three winners received 3,000 yuan (nearly ₹ 38,000), 2,000 yuan (around ₹ 25,000) and 1,000 yuan (about ₹ 12,500).

Now a Swiss tax resident, Mittal plans to spend more time in Dubai, where he has expanded his property investments.", "content": "Indian-origin steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal has decided to leave the United Kingdom as the Labour Party government prepares a major tax overhaul targeting the ultra-wealthy, The Sunday Times reported on Sunday (November 23). The India-born founder of ArcelorMittal, based in London, is now a tax resident of Switzerland and will shift much of his time to Dubai, the report said. According to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, Mittal’s fortune stands at £15.4 billion, making him the eighth richest person in Britain. Mittal already owns a mansion in Dubai and has recently acquired “tracts of an intriguing development on nearby Naïa Island,” the report said, signalling a long-term shift of his base to the UAE. The move comes amid widespread anxiety over expected tax increases on wealthy residents as Chancellor Rachel Reeves seeks to plug a £20-billion gap in Britain’s finances. Her first Budget last year raised capital gains tax , cut entrepreneurs’ relief, and introduced new levies on family business transfers. Speculation of more to come—including a possible 20% exit tax on wealthy individuals leaving the UK—has unsettled high-net-worth families. An adviser familiar with the Mittal family’s plans told The Sunday Times that inheritance tax, not income tax, was the decisive factor. “It wasn’t the tax on income (or capital gains ) that was the issue,” the adviser said. “The issue was inheritance tax. Many wealthy people from overseas cannot understand why all of their assets, wherever they are in the world, should be subject to inheritance tax imposed by the UK Treasury.” The adviser added the looming policy changes have left many global elites feeling forced out.

The report said that Singh was arrested and sentenced to a short jail term, and he will now face deportation and a lifetime ban from re-entering Canada. Toronto Sun reported that Singh came to Canada in July on a six-month visa and regularly visited the smoking area of a high school where he tried to engage with young girls.  The report noted that the girls reported that Singh, who did not speak English, attempted to interact with them and asked for photographs. He managed to take one photo with two girls, under the impression that they thought he would leave afterwards. However, after sitting between them, he posed for another photo and then put his arm around one of the girls. The girl stood up and pushed his arm away, the report noted. He was granted bail but was arrested again after a new complaint surfaced on the same day. When presented in court, Singh pleaded not guilty to sexual interference but guilty to harassment. “You had no business being at the property of that high school,” Justice Krista Lynn Leszczynski remarked while delivering her verdict on the case.  “This type of conduct will not be tolerated.” Singh's lawyer informed the judge that his client had found his time in jail both shocking and lasting. One of the girls impacted by Singh's actions expressed the emotional toll, stating, “Part of what makes this so difficult is that the offender was someone who had come to Canada as a newcomer. This betrayal has affected the way I see people of his culture and men who are older than me.” Singh was arrested on 16 September and initially charged with sexual interference and sexual assault.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: “UKRAINE ‘LEADERSHIP’ HAS EXPRESSED ZERO GRATITUDE FOR OUR EFFORTS, AND EUROPE CONTINUES TO BUY OIL FROM RUSSIA.” Trump also attacked blaming the Biden administration for the conflict. Trump wrote that the Russia–Ukraine war “would have NEVER HAPPENED” with “strong and proper U.S. and Ukrainian leadership,” claiming he had “inherited a war that should have never happened.” He again asserted the 2020 US election was “rigged,” adding that Putin “never would have attacked” under his leadership.  The Geneva meetings opened with allies discussing how to reshape the 28-point US blueprint, which Kyiv and European governments fear tilts too heavily toward Moscow. Zelensky noted that early feedback suggested the US plan might incorporate “a number of elements based on the Ukrainian vision,” though he did not specify which ones. “Further work is ongoing to ensure that all elements are truly effective in achieving the main goal — putting an end to the bloodshed and the war,” he said. The US plan has been met with deep concern across Europe. Ukraine and its partners have ruled out any territorial concessions, warning that such terms would reward Russian aggression. French deputy defense minister Alice Rufo said restrictions on Ukraine’s military—outlined in the US draft—represent “a limitation on its sovereignty.” “Ukraine must be able to defend itself,” she said. “Russia wants war and has waged war many times over the past years.” Zelensky has repeatedly insisted Ukraine will “always defend” its land and people.

Reuters stated that residents in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a stronghold of the Iran-backed group, reported hearing the roar of warplanes before a powerful blast shook the area. The strike hit a main road in the densely populated Haret Hreik neighbourhood. A Reuters reporter on the scene said people rushed out of their apartment buildings fearing further strikes. The news outlet citing medical sources said at least two dozen people were wounded and taken to nearby hospitals. Hezbollah and Lebanon’s health ministry have not yet issued any statements. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s office said he personally ordered the strike, claiming it targeted Hezbollah’s “chief of staff.” “In the heart of Beirut, the IDF attacked the Hezbollah chief of staff, who had been leading the terrorist organisation's buildup and rearmament,” his office said. “Israel is determined to act to achieve its objectives everywhere and at all times.” Earlier on Sunday, Netanyahu told his cabinet that Israel would continue fighting “terrorism” on multiple fronts. “We will continue to do whatever is necessary to prevent Hezbollah from reestablishing its ability to threaten us,” he said. The strike follows weeks of intensified Israeli attacks on southern Lebanon as part of what Israel says is an effort to block Hezbollah from rebuilding its military capabilities.

The US objected strongly to South Africa’s agenda, which foregrounded climate action, debt relief and global inequality. Trump had dismissed these priorities before the summit, rejecting efforts to help developing nations adapt to worsening weather disasters, transition to clean energy or lower their debt burdens. Despite this, Ramaphosa secured broad support for language traditionally opposed by Washington. The declaration underscored: -the seriousness of climate change -the need for ambitious renewable energy targets -the punishing debt service burdens faced by poorer nations Ramaphosa said the declaration proved that the world’s major economies could still rally around shared priorities. “This declaration shows that our shared goals outweigh our differences,” he said at Sunday’s closing ceremony. “It reflects a renewed commitment to multilateral cooperation.” Argentina also opposed the declaration after its President, Javier Milei — an ally of Trump — skipped the meeting.

The postponement has cast a pause on the grand celebrations as the family focuses on his health. According to the cricketer’s manager, Tuhin Mishra, Shriniwas began feeling unwell during breakfast at the family farmhouse, prompting an immediate call for an ambulance. He was rushed to Sarvhit Hospital in Sangli, where doctors confirmed elevated cardiac enzymes, as well as raised blood pressure, and placed him under careful observation.  Family physician Dr Naman Shah explained that his symptoms pointed to angina , and if his condition worsens, they might need to perform angiography. Shriniwas Mandhana is not just the father of a cricketing icon – his own journey in sport and in business deeply influenced Smriti’s rise. In his younger days, Shriniwas played cricket at the district level for Sangli, harbouring dreams of pursuing the game more seriously. However, he was unable to pursue a full professional playing career, reportedly due to a lack of support from his own parents. Beyond cricket, Shriniwas built a life for his family through his work as a chemical distributor. Over the years, he became a pillar of support for Smriti and her siblings, encouraging their cricketing ambitions. His belief in them was unshakeable — he often said he hoped one of his children would one day represent India. Smriti, in particular, has spoken of her father’s steady but firm encouragement. Growing up, she would often accompany him to cricket grounds, watch him or her brother play, and learn the game’s nuances.

The clarification followed an article published by Islamabad's Geo TV on November 21, which claimed that a French naval commander had affirmed Pakistan's air superiority and stated that Indian Rafale jets were shot down during border skirmishes. The Navy said the report not only misquoted French officers but even published the wrong name, referring to the officer as \"Jacques Launay\" instead of his real name, Captain Yvan Launay. In a statement released on its official X account, the Marine Nationale said all the remarks attributed to Captain Launay were fabricated. \"These statements were attributed to Captain Launay, who never gave his consent for any form of publication.

It also alleged that he confirmed that Indian Rafales were shot down and linked the outcome to supposed Chinese support. The French Navy said none of this was true.

Subsequently, bomb disposal and dog units from the Udham Singh Nagar and Nainital districts were also summoned to conduct a meticulous search of the location.

The TV personality from Hunan suffered a sudden illness that changed her life. Liang joined Hunan TV in 2001 and had a promising future. But, only four months into the job, she collapsed backstage. She later came to know that she had a rare spinal cord vascular malformation. The condition ruptured and compressed her central nervous system. It left her paralysed from the chest down at age 22. Even though she regained movement in her upper limbs after surgery , she was put in a wheelchair. Liang initially struggled with anger and frustration during her hospital stay. She felt her career and future had been taken away. Her perspective gradually shifted when she encountered kindness from strangers. She started spreading positivity to other patients. She later met renowned writer Shi Tiesheng, who was also paralysed young. Yet, he inspired millions with his optimistic work. Liang rebuilt her confidence and identity. Eventually, she returned to television as a wheelchair anchor. Now, she has become a symbol of resilience in China. “We are unaware of the despair we will encounter when we are young. The only thing we can do is read and think, so that we can fight the despair when we encounter it,” the South China Morning Post quoted Shi as telling her. Liang Yi rebuilt her career through strong will and discipline. In 2011, she studied intensely for three months and was admitted to a master’s program in broadcasting and hosting at the Communication University of China. The following year, she returned to Hunan TV and made her historic comeback on screen as a wheelchair anchor.

The victim was instructed to pay in cash, avoiding online transactions. Trusting the healer, the victim purchased the medicine and was later given another product, Bhavan Booti oil, priced at ₹ 76,000 per gram. Over the following weeks, he spent ₹ 17 lakh on various medicines as directed by Guruji.

Carney added that consensus reached by leaders at the G20 meeting this weekend is significant, even without US participation, as per the report. According to the report, Donald Trump said that US would stay away from this year's G20 meeting repeating a debunked claim that White Afrikaner farmers in South Africa are being subjected to a genocide.

Addressing a press conference on Johannesburg on 23 November, Carney said that the G20 summit “brought together nations representing three-quarters of the world’s population, two-thirds of global GDP and three-quarters of the world’s trade, and that’s without the United States formally attending. It’s a reminder that the center of gravity in the global economy is shifting.” Carney took office earlier this year after running a campaign that pushed back against Trump’s imposition of tariffs on its northern neighbor and suggestions it could become part of US territory.

At the press conference, he detailed his attempts to strengthen ties with nations ranging from South Africa to India and China.
