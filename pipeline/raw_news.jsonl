The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Kozhikode is conducting the exam in three sessions today, November 30, with each session running for two hours. Earlier this morning, Slot 1 was held from 8:30 am to 10:30 am. CAT 2025 Live Updates : Slot 1 concludes, slot 2 exam to begin shortly Initial student reactions from test centres suggest a paper that was “manageable but slightly more difficult” than last year’s Slot 1. This year’s test comprises 66 questions across Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DILR), and Quantitative Ability (QA). As per the marking scheme, candidates will receive three marks for each correct answer, lose one mark for every incorrect answer, and face no penalty for unattempted questions. According to Gautam Puri, Co-founder and MD of Career Launcher, CAT 2025 Slot 1 had a total of 68 questions to be attempted in 120 minutes, with the overall paper described as “quite tricky” and more difficult than last year. While VARC and QA were broadly at par with last year’s test, DILR saw a slight jump in difficulty. The VARC section contained 24 questions, including 4 TITA (Type In The Answer) and 20 MCQs, to be completed in 40 minutes. According to Puri’s analysis, the section was broadly similar to CAT 2024 Slot 1. Students found the passages dense, but questions centred around the central ideas rather than complex inference-based tasks, keeping the section within a doable range. The verbal portion in particular was reportedly on the easier side. The DILR section featured 22 questions with about 11–12 TITA items. Students had 40 minutes to attempt this section. Experts observed a marginal increase in difficulty compared to the previous year, mainly because of time-consuming sets and complex interlinked data.

Sangma announced the release of the second and final instalment of the Umbrella Post Matric Scholarship , amounting to ₹130 crore, for nearly 70,000 students for the 2024-25 academic year on Friday. The event took place at the district auditorium and was attended by Education Minister Lakhmen Rymbui, Commissioner and Secretary of Education Vijay Kumar Mantri, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Vibhor Aggarwal, and Director of Higher and Technical Education Hazel D. B. Sangma. During his address, Sangma explained that the state government is releasing the full scholarship amount using its own resources, as it has not yet received funds from the central government. He emphasised that the decision to provide the funds in advance was made to alleviate difficulties faced by students. Previously, rules prevented the advance transfer of scholarships; however, the state has now established a mechanism with the central government to facilitate earlier disbursement. Once the Rs 130 crore is transferred to the Meghalaya Rural Bank, processing and account verification will take a few days before students receive their funds. He urged students to ensure their bank accounts are linked to Aadhaar. Sangma reiterated that education remains a top priority for the government. He announced that reforms to address long-standing issues faced by ad hoc and SSA teachers are nearing completion and could be implemented in the next financial year. The program also included participation from thousands of students virtually joining from 200 locations across the state.

My early schooling happened in my hometown, where I developed a strong inclination toward science and problem-solving. My mother is a homemaker, my father runs a small business, and one of the most influential people in my life has been my uncle, a teacher who shaped my academic habits and discipline from a young age. From childhood, I was driven by one constant observation – the deplorable condition of road infrastructure in my region. I often wondered why the roads were so bad and how things could be improved. This curiosity gradually turned into a focused interest in civil engineering. Today, I am 24 years old and currently undertaking my PhD with the IIT Madras-Deakin Research Academy. I am in the Civil Engineering department at IIT Madras , in my second year of the Joint PhD programme, working on the topic – ‘An effective framework for the extraction and utilisation of recycled materials in road infrastructure’. I will soon be heading to Deakin University, Australia. After finishing my basic schooling in my village, I pursued a BTech in Civil Engineering at NIT Srinagar . I stayed active in projects, technical events and independent learning during my BTech years, but the real shift in my academic direction came when I joined IIT Madras for a research internship. That experience deepened my interest in research. I later returned to IIT Madras for my BTech project, which helped me clearly understand my strengths and long-term goals. The real push towards research came during my internship at IIT Madras under the guidance of Dr Bibhuti Bhushan Bhardwaj (then PhD scholar, now assistant professor) and my mentor Prof Surender Singh.

The UK’s net migration for the year ending June 2025 fell by 204,000, marking an 80 per cent drop from its 2023 peak, one of the steepest annual declines since post-pandemic reopening. The ONS data, according to a PTI report, shows that around 45,000 Indians on study visas and 22,000 on work visas left the country during this period. A further 7,000 Indian nationals recorded under the ‘other’ visa category also emigrated, taking the total to approximately 74,000 Indian departures, the highest among non-EU nationalities. Chinese nationals recorded the second-highest exits at around 42,000. The ONS, in its release, noted that Indian citizens formed the single largest non-EU group leaving the UK, even as they continued to remain the top nationality arriving for both study and work. Despite the outflow, Indians still received 90,000 study visa grants and 46,000 work visas in the same period, underscoring their continued significance in UK immigration trends. The ONS attributes this high level of emigration primarily to international students who originally entered the UK on study visas. The data states that the increase in long-term emigration of non-EU nationals who originally arrived on study-related visas is primarily being driven by the large numbers of Indian and Chinese nationals leaving in the year ending June 2025. The fall in net migration coincides with a series of tightening measures introduced by the UK government, particularly affecting international students and entry-level workers.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has notified the full admission schedule for private schools, stating that forms will be available from December 4, and the first list of selected candidates will be declared on January 23. From neighbourhood proximity to sibling and alumni considerations, a range of criteria is expected to shape admissions in entry-level classes in Delhi ’s private schools, as per news agency PTI. Under the revised structure issued by the DoE, the foundational stage comprises Nursery and KG, followed by Class 1. For the 2026–27 session, this is the age group criteria as on March 31, 2026: — A child must be between three and four years old for Nursery — Four and five years for KG — Five and six years for Class 1 Schools may allow age relaxation of up to one month at the discretion of the head of school. These norms will be uniformly implemented across all recognised unaided private schools from the upcoming academic year, the department said.

The last date for submitting application forms is December 27.

According to DAAD (a German academic exchange programme), the number of Indian students in Germany has doubled from 28,905 in 2020 to 59,419 at present. Study abroad consultant companies also shared that they have seen a spike in interest from aspirants. ApplyBoard’s internal survey echoes the trend — 75 per cent of students surveyed expressed interest in Germany, and 77 per cent of counsellors said it remains one of the most affordable major study-abroad options. Experts say the enthusiasm is driven by Germany’s reputation for quality education, tuition-free or low-cost public universities, and strong post-study opportunities. A recent DAAD survey highlights how nearly two-thirds of international students want to remain and work in the country after graduation. Germany also boasts one of the highest long-term retention rates globally, with 45 per cent of foreign students still living there a decade after they first enrolled, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, the question remains: Are students arriving with a full understanding of the country’s challenges? Consultants report rising interest, but those living in Germany describe a tougher reality — one shaped by language barriers, scarce accommodation, and slow bureaucracy. Germany is currently facing a shortage of over 2 lakh jobs, with particularly high demand in six sectors, according to Deutschland.de , a portal operated on behalf of the Federal Foreign Office.

Singh commended UPSC’s ‘Pratibha Setu’ portal , which seeks to create new opportunities for candidates who have cleared the civil services examination stages but did not make it to the final selection, by connecting them with private sector and institutional openings. He termed the move “an innovative bridge between talent and opportunity,” ensuring that India’s intellectual potential is not lost but leveraged for national development. The minister also emphasised UPSC’s larger role beyond recruitment, framing and updating service rules, reviewing administrative practices, and setting ethical standards for public service.

A new survey of 1,000 London business leaders, commissioned by London Higher, an umbrella body representing the city’s higher education sector, shows overwhelming support for international students and graduates, alongside strong concern that restrictive visa moves could erode the market’s competitiveness. Drawing on the data and insights in the report, indianexpress.com analysed key aspects: why London businesses say international talent matters, which sectors rely on it the most, and how the UK’s recent immigration rule changes fit into the broader picture. At a time when countries are debating whether international students strain local systems or fill crucial labour shortages, London employers lean firmly toward the latter view. According to the survey,  93% of business leaders say international talent helps address skills gaps — from digital skills to multilingual communication and adaptability. Of which, only 4% believe international workers reduce opportunities for domestic talent. Whereas 89% say international professionals support innovation, compared to just 6% who think they slow local innovation. About 91% say they help maintain London’s competitiveness vis-a-vis New York, Singapore and Paris. This aligns with the long-term reality that London’s workforce is deeply international: 40% of payrolled workers are non-UK nationals, many in high-growth sectors like information technology, finance, consulting and creative industries.

IIM Kozhikode launched a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) programme this year with 110 students at the institute’s Kochi campus – students major in management with a choice of minors in subjects including economics and public policy, and artificial intelligence and machine learning. IIM Sambalpur launched two UG programmes this year – one in management and public policy, and another in data science and AI, while IIM Bangalore will launch UG programmes in economics and data science next year, and IIM Sirmaur launched one in management studies last year. Prof Chatterjee pointed to a “slow disenchantment with MBA (courses) across the global spectrum” and said that IIMs are on the threshold of looking more like universities. We were witnessing a gradual, slow disenchantment with MBA across the global spectrum, although the story in India is still very vibrant, and the number of applications far outnumber the numbers we can take in. But we were sensing that…students wanting to invest two years of their precious life in the middle of their careers or the threshold of their careers…they are pretty picky about what they get in these two years. We thought that we have to reimagine management education from the bottom up, from the foundation level. IIMs are generally secondhand car dealers, as far as learners are concerned – they are more or less finished by the time they reach us. So, if we could introduce management thinking to young minds at an early stage, we could build agile thinkers…who are interdisciplinary, culturally grounded and innovation driven.

Narayanan was attending a High Level Expert Committee and New Syllabus Design Committee meeting organised by Tamil Nadu to facilitate revision of the state curriculum at the Anna Centenary Library. The meeting was led by Tamil Nadu ’s School Education Minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting, Narayanan stressed the need for value-based education. “There are two types of education. One is an intellectual-based education. You study Mathematics, Science… and score high marks. But value-based education also includes values like protecting our parents, respecting others, respecting teachers and tolerance. It is our desire that students should study with a sense of such distinction. The book alone is not important. It is the overall personality development that is important,” the ISRO chief said. Narayanan, who did his early schooling in a government school in Tamil Nadu, also said it really does not matter where one is schooled. “How you study, how you grow, that is important. From where, which school, that is not important. Wherever one studies, if they study well, they can grow well,” he added. He underscored that it is also important to look beyond conventional fields. “About 40 years ago, if you asked any student, ‘What do you want to be?’, he or she would say ‘doctor’, or ‘engineer’, one or two people would say ‘collector’. They didn’t know about other fields. But for a nation to transform into a developed nation, it must develop in all fields – be it the arts field, or sports,” said Narayanan. He pushed for a syllabus that is current and future-ready. It should incorporate “new things” like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, but the teachers should also be trained in these new developments. “At the meeting, we discussed all these.

Immigration rules are shifting in countries such as the US, and the UK, Canada, and Australia; post-study work rights have become more restrictive in some regions; and cost-of-living pressures continue to influence decisions. Add to this the uncertainty created by advances in artificial intelligence, a common concern has emerged among aspirants: which degrees abroad will remain employable and stable across borders in the long run? The uncertainty of intake policies, paired with ambiguity over the ‘right domain for employment’ has now become a key factor in course selection. Beyond high salaries and global mobility, a sustainable career increasingly means choosing a field that AI cannot easily replace. According to a report by IDP Education, the most secure future-proof jobs share one common thread: they require human judgment, empathy, physical presence, or complex decision-making — something that machines cannot replicate. According to the findings, healthcare and medicine dominate the list of AI-resistant roles worldwide. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, urologists, rehabilitation physicians, and nurse anesthetists are among the most secure careers, with risk-of-automation levels close to zero. These roles may adopt AI-supported tools, but their core responsibilities, diagnosis, emotional support, and human interaction, will continue to require people. The report also noted that postgraduate education significantly improves job security and salary potential. Many of the highest-scoring AI-safe jobs require advanced qualifications, especially within medicine and nursing. But students who want to start working after a bachelor’s degree also have options: physicists, nurse midwives, physical therapists, and security managers fall in the AI-safe category even without further study.

According to a bulletin from the Lok Sabha, the proposed legislation is titled the Higher Education Commission of India Bill. This new Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) was suggested in the National Education Policy and aims to replace the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) , and the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) . While the UGC oversees non-technical higher education, the AICTE is responsible for technical education, and the NCTE regulates teacher education. The Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) is proposed to serve as a single regulator for higher education. However, it will not oversee medical and law colleges. The HECI is intended to fulfil three main roles: regulation, accreditation, and establishing professional standards. Funding, considered a fourth aspect, will not fall under the authority of the HECI; the administrative ministry will retain control over funding autonomy. The concept of the HECI has previously been discussed in the form of a draft bill. In 2018, a draft bill titled “Higher Education Commission of India (Repeal of University Grants Commission Act)” was released for public feedback and consultation with stakeholders. This bill aimed to repeal the UGC Act and establish the HECI. Renewed efforts to bring the HECI into existence were initiated by Dharmendra Pradhan, who became the Union Education Minister in July 2021. Underlining the relevance of a single higher education regulator, the NEP-2020 document says, “The regulatory system needs a complete overhaul to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive.” It adds that the new system should ensure the distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting are ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/winter-session-parliament-to-take-up-bill-replacing-ugc-aicte-ncte-with-single-regulator-10381204/", "timestamp": 1764487435.3697}

At this stage, revision should be your primary focus, rather than learning something new. Revisit key concepts, formulae, and question types you’re already familiar with.

The bench of Justice Amrita Sinha passed the order on Thursday after lawyers representing the relevant parties brought to the court’s notice that the apex court has already fixed the hearing on granting teaching experience marks of the candidates on November 24 and 26. The court was responding to a petition which challenged the stage at which the 10 marks earmarked for ‘experience’ be allotted, arguing they ought to be added during the compilation of the final merit list not before short listing candidates for interviews. The West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) submitted that the said marks must be included while preparing the list of eligible candidates.

The SSC is yet to publish the results for the tests of teachers’ recruitment to classes 9-10, where it is likely to follow the same marking pattern.

The Indian National Students Association (INSA) UK and Creoo came together at the summit in the Houses of Parliament complex earlier this week to launch the Indian National Students Employability Council (INSEC). It is conceived as the first national body dedicated to improving career outcomes for Indian students in Britain, the largest group of international students in the country, at an estimated 166,000. “In the last 18 months alone, over 36 panels have discussed international students, yet students report little tangible improvement. INSEC is not another panel, it is a commitment that starts today,” said Ayesha Goyal, Founder and CEO of Creoo. INSEC has committed to delivering a National Career Roadshow across leading universities such as the London School of Economics (LSE) , University College London (UCL), and King’s College London and launching the first UK-wide study on ‘Indian Student Outcomes’ early next year, followed by a National Advisory Board to ensure Indian student representation in policy decisions. “What is the point of doing studies here when I do not even get a response to my application from the employer? That is what students are asking,” said Amit Tiwari, INSA UK National President. “INSA is an organisation that helps and supports Indian students in the UK. It is created as a forum to bring students together, a forum to ask questions and participate in discussions,” he said. The summit on Monday, opened by Labour MP and member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Indo-British relations Navendu Mishra, was designed to spotlight some of the key issues being faced by the Indian student community in the UK. “This year marks a crucial year for India-UK relationship.

With policy shifts, rising costs, and tightening job markets across major destinations, students — especially from India — are choosing countries that offer stable policies, lower expenses, and clearer post-study work opportunities over traditional “prestige” options.

The full ApplyBoard Building and Rebuilding Global Education 2026 Trends Report is available on the organisation’s website. The report highlights that rising tuition fees and higher proof-of-funds requirements in Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia have prompted students to look beyond the English-speaking “Big Four.” Germany and Ireland are emerging as the most affordable destinations , offering lower tuition fees and flexible pathways to work. France and Spain are witnessing record enrolments, supported by housing initiatives and simplified visa processes Stricter policies across established destinations are slowing demand.

There are many who genuinely think that if they do well in one, they are obviously sacrificing the other. This is completely false. Board exam preparation and JEE Main preparation work together. The perception that the boards suffer because of the JEE Main preparation is one of the student’s most incorrect assumptions. In exploring both the material, syllabus, and principles, 99 per cent of the syllabus covered in the JEE Main is the same as the boards in Class 11 and Class 12. It does not matter whether it is physics, chemistry, or mathematics; the theoretical concepts are identical in both formats. Yes, JEE Advanced may demand a deeper and more analytical understanding, but if we focus solely on JEE Main preparation, the only difference is the level of application of those concepts, and not the concepts themselves. JEE Main simply tests your capability on more sophisticated and multi-concept problems in an objective format, while the boards will assess a deeper understanding utilising step-wise communication in a more subjective format. If a student prepares properly for JEE Main by developing an understanding of concepts rather than simply looking for shortcuts, he or she is preparing for boards as well. Developing strong fundamentals and solving problems on a regular basis leads to conceptual clarity, which is what boards primarily try to assess testing. A student studying NCERT thoroughly or solving NCERT-appropriate questions during their preparation for JEE Main is not going to have weak preparation in regards to boards.

The minors, who have filed the petition through their parents, said they actively participate in state-scheduled sports tournaments, camps and trials in Delhi and other parts of the country. They said it is a scientifically established and judicially noticed fact that Delhi faces an annual public health emergency during the winter months and the scheduling of the school, inter-zonal, state and national level sporting events in the city around this period is increasingly becoming a major health issue for children participating in such events. It said year after year, authorities continue to conduct these outdoor sporting events at a time when Delhi’s air quality is verifiably and foreseeably ‘severe’ and ‘hazardous’. This repeated scheduling forces children, recognised as a vulnerable group, to undertake strenuous physical activity in toxic air, violating their fundamental rights, the plea said, adding that during this period, the Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently remains in the “Severe” category. It sought a direction to the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education and School Federation of India Games to schedule the annual sports calendar (including all zonal, inter-zonal, state, and national tournaments, trials and coaching camps) for all outdoor sports in the capital during safer and less susceptible months with verifiably better ambient air quality. The petitioners said at the time of filing the plea, the city was under the Grade Response Action Plan-III (GRAP-III) emergency plan and risked escalation to GRAP-IV.

The research has been published in Behavioural Brain Research, an international peer-reviewed journal that focuses on the neurobiological basis of behaviour and cognitive processes in both humans and animals. This study examines how the brain and heart interact in students who experience anxiety during exams, providing a scientific foundation for early identification and the development of personalised coping strategies. According to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT, 2022), test anxiety affects an estimated 81 per cent of Indian students. This condition can significantly impair academic performance and long-term mental health. While some students can perform well under pressure, others may resort to avoidance behaviour, finding it difficult to cope effectively. Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the Department of Engineering Design at IIT Madras led the research team to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon, emphasizing the importance of objective physiological data over self-reported perceptions. “They discovered that when the brain-heart communication network breaks down during stress, certain students are more likely to experience heightened anxiety and avoidance, revealing a clear biological distinction between adaptive and maladaptive test responses,” he told PTI. “The study’s breakthrough lies in integrating two physiological markers: Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)—a brain-based indicator of emotional regulation—and Heart Rate Variability (HRV)—a measure of the heart’s adaptive control. Together, these signals help identify students predisposed to anxiety,” he added.

A new report by Indeed reveals that entry-level and junior employees are the primary drivers behind the rapid adoption of work behaviours—from ‘quiet quitting’ to ‘job hopping’—forcing organisations to urgently redefine engagement and loyalty. According to the Indeed Workplace Trends in India Report, a commanding 68 per cent of employers acknowledge that new workplace trends are mostly engaged by entry to junior-level employees. The data pinpoints this generation as the engine behind the new work norms, including quiet revolt and exit-prep behaviours such as resenteeism and career cushioning. The report highlights that 58 per cent of Gen Z employees have engaged in these quiet revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once in their career. This acceleration of new behaviours has deepened a fundamental disconnect between management and staff. While employees may see their actions as necessary for survival and career progression, practices like micro-retirements and AI-driven routines are seen as adaptation —employers often interpret them as signs of disengagement or disloyalty. As the report states, “What feels like adaptation to employees often looks like erosion to employers”. These exit-prep behaviours have become highly visible, particularly in high-pressure environments. The E-Commerce sector emerged as a key hotspot, with 57 per cent of employees in the industry admitting to engaging in revolting and exit-prep behaviours at least once, a figure described as much higher than other sectors. Commenting on the shift, Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales, Indeed India, emphasised that these practices are not a sign of rebellion. “People are adopting experimental practices from skill shifts to flexible routines,” he noted. “This is not a rebellion, but as resilience strategies.

He said 199 headmasters have honed their strategic and managerial skills at IIM Ahmedabad , and 144 primary teachers have completed an immersive training in Finland so far. He said these teachers, selected on merit, are expected to act as ‘master trainers,’ cascading their acquired knowledge and skills to their peers upon their return, thereby creating a multiplier effect throughout the state’s educational system. “This is not just a training programme. It’s a mission to transform Punjab’s future. By exposing our teachers to the finest educational ecosystems in the world, from Finland’s collaborative learning models to IIM Ahmedabad’s strategic leadership frameworks, we are ensuring that our students receive an education that is future-ready, holistic and on par with global standards.

As a child, I was obsessed with how things worked – so much so that I still have a box full of motors and Arduino boards lying at home in Dhanbad. Robotics was my first love, and it naturally pushed me toward physics and math. My parents noticed this early, and with guidance from my brother, who had gone through the JEE grind, and my sister, a doctor, I realised that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) was the right path for me. When I scored 95.8 per cent in my board exams just to make my mother happy, it only confirmed one thing – my heart lay in physics, not in memorising chapters for school exams. So when it came time for Joint Seat Allocation Authority ( JoSAA ) counselling, I was very sure of what I didn’t want – chemistry. My father discovered the BTech programme in Engineering Physics at IIT Guwahati and explained that it would let me study physics deeply while keeping strong career options open. I didn’t take a second to think – I locked the choice in the first round and never looked back. I am a 21-year-old from Dhanbad, Jharkhand, a city where I spent the initial years of my life and built every core memory I still cherish. I studied at DAV Koyla Nagar before moving to Kota for Class 11 and 12. My father is a police inspector with the Jharkhand Police, and my mother was a teacher. She left her job after my Class 10 to move with me to Kota so I could prepare for JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Their sacrifices shaped everything I am today. Dhanbad still feels like home in the truest sense—every road has a memory, and every corner reminds me of my school friends and growing-up years. I appeared for JEE Main and JEE Advanced in 2022. But the journey to that point was not easy. The lockdown struck right after my Class 10 exams, and beginning JEE preparation online robbed me of the momentum and energy that every student needs during the initial ", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/education/life-in-an-iit-guwahati-btech-programme-in-engineering-physics-final-year-jharkhand-ppo-placement-jeemain-2026-jee-advanced-10367661/", "timestamp": 1764487482.4716628}

The H-1B is particularly known for bringing in hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers to the United States since November 1990, when President George HW Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990 into law and formally introduced it as a distinct visa category. Greene’s proposal comes against the backdrop of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign students and workers. Greene’s proposed Bill would eliminate the H-1B visa program , which she claims, in a video posted on X, “has been riddled with fraud and abuse and has been displacing American workers for decades.” However, there’s a narrow exception: the proposed Bill would allow up to 10,000 visas annually for doctors and nurses providing life-saving care to Americans. But even this exemption isn’t permanent; it would be phased out over 10 years to allow time to develop what Greene calls “our own pipeline of American doctors and physicians.” ALSO READ| OPT hope, H1B hurdles: Indian students in US grapple with changing visa rules Currently, H-1B workers can apply for permanent residency through their employers and eventually pursue US citizenship. Greene’s proposed Bill would sever this connection entirely. The legislation would “take away the pathway to citizenship, forcing visa holders to return home when their visa expires.” This represents a return to the original concept of temporary work visas, where workers would come, provide specialised skills, and then leave. What’s the rationale? Greene argues these visas were intended to address speciality occupational needs at specific times, not to provide a permanent immigration pathway. “People should not be allowed to come and live here forever,” she states. Perhaps the most controversial provision targets medical education.

It depends on the individual strengths of the candidate, their comfort level, and their temperament for the examination. Each student has their own methodology when it comes to answering questions, and therefore this methodology should be personal rather than taken from student-to-student. Let us look at some points to clarify: 1. It is Subjective: The order you choose to answer the paper is highly subjective. What suits one student may not suit another student. For example, some students like to start with Mathematics, while others may prefer Chemistry or Physics. Again, the goal is to play to your strengths instead of depending on what another student may have decided to do. Also Read | JEE Main 2026: IIT Mandi’s most opted BTech courses this year; new AI-Data Science debuts strong 2. Identify your strongest subject: Before deciding the order, first figure out what your strongest subject is: – Which subject, or subjects, are you most comfortable with – Assess your mock tests and past used assessments or assessments – Choose the subject that you feel confident you can score high on in a short period of time – Since you are starting with your strongest subject, you are able to get an early confidence boost, plus saving time. This is a massive psychological advantage that can potentially set up a positive momentum for the rest of the paper. 3. Use mock tests for hit-and-trial: In deciding your final strategy, a couple of good practices are to attempt mock tests and former year papers: – If possible, be able to do first physics subject in many tests, and first choose chemistry subject in other tests, and so on. – Management and comfort are detected in this observation period. – Based on that you can do the order that gives you the best overall performance. – There is no one or best order.

Clusters of chatter bloom near staff rooms, and the air feels electric with curiosity and youthful chaos. It’s a scene that plays out daily, almost like a ritual. But just beyond this everyday hum, tucked quietly into the green folds of Delhi , lie two different kinds of institutions– Higashi Autism School (HAS) and India Autism Centre (IAC). Here, the corridors don’t buzz with noise, but every step, every glance, every interaction is like a carefully choreographed dance. During our visit to the school that is based in Vasant Kunj, we met a student who refuses to wear undergarments at home but puts them on the moment he enters school – his day doesn’t begin until that sensory need is met. Another child waits for his mother in clothes of blue and yellow; any deviation from this palette means resistance and a delay in going home. For autistic students, the day begins not with bells and bustle, but with structure, calm, and reassurance. Their world is layered with sensory sensitivities, emotional nuances, and coping mechanisms that often go unnoticed in mainstream narratives.  The Higashi School, with a day-boarding setup, has 35 teachers supporting 38 autistic children aged 4 to 12, each with unique needs – from physical challenges to sensory sensitivities. Teaching here goes far beyond academics. Educators act as emotional anchors, often decoding what even parents can’t – sleep patterns, toilet habits, learning rhythms, and therapy responses. They rely not just on observation, but on intuition, attuned to the subtle cues that define each child’s world.  On the other hand, IAC’s Residential Facility Samavesh, located near Sirakol, Kolkata , aims to provide holistic care to the students with neurodevelopmental issues.

But the season’s struggles tell only part of a much larger story that’s reshaping how investors think about women’s sports. Despite its lackluster on-field performance, Angel City itself has become a case study (including literally , inside Harvard Business School) in how to best construct a women’s sports property. The team’s celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball. “We went from zero to $30 million in revenue. We sold out games. We built something people didn’t think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an interview last month , pointing to Angel City’s commercial success from the very outset of the team’s formation. That commercial success, not trophies, became the blueprint for Monarch Collective, the $250 million fund Nortman launched in 2023 , which has become the first investment vehicle focused exclusively on women’s sports. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch’s portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City’s training facility in Thousand Oaks, California. The fund now holds stakes in three other National Women’s Soccer League clubs: San Diego Wave, Boston Legacy FC (debuting next year), and its newest investment, announced earlier this month , FC Viktoria Berlin. The deal for 38% of the German club , makes Monarch the first foreign investor to acquire a stake in a German women’s soccer team. It’s a diverse collection that reflects Nortman’s conviction that women’s sports have reached an inflection point, regardless of any single team’s fortunes. The numbers support her optimism, too. “The overall men’s sports marke", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/vc-kara-nortman-bet-early-on-womens-sports-and-now-shes-creating-the-market/", "timestamp": 1764487773.4214349}

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band.

Three experts offered their insights at TechCrunch Disrupt.", "content": "For years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market. “You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler , general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month. The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise. “When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said. Alison Wagonfeld , vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required. “You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said. Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added. Marc Manara , head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it. “There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.” Specifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past.

And the fight that’s brewing isn’t about the technology, it’s about who gets to do the regulating. In the absence of a meaningful federal AI standard that focuses on consumer safety, states have introduced dozens of bills to protect residents against AI-related harms, including California’s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas’s Responsible AI Governance Act, which prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems. The tech giants and buzzy startups born out of Silicon Valley argue such laws create an unworkable patchwork that threatens innovation. “It’s going to slow us in the race against China,” Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, told TechCrunch. The industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all. In the trenches of that all-or-nothing battle, new efforts have emerged to prohibit states from enacting their own AI legislation. House lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI. A sweeping preemption that would take away states’ rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year. Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight. To create that national standard, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk. A megabill such as this will likely take months, if not years, to become law, underscoring why the current rush to li", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/", "timestamp": 1764487773.8181417}

As a result, there are numerous apps to help you do things like create a single place to organize your life or help you stay focused on your day-to-day tasks by blocking out distractions. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best ones that are available on the App Store. Goodnotes is one of the most popular iPad apps , and for good reason. The app is great for people who like to write out notes using an Apple Pencil ; you can include both handwritten and typed text on one page and add things like images, stickers, and even doodles. You can create a digital notebook with blank or ruled paper for notes, checklists, planners, and more. The app lets you export entire digital notebooks or specific pages into PDFs and other files. Goodnotes is also great for drawing and sketching. While it’s not as advanced as some creativity apps like Procreate, Goodnotes is easy to use and perfect for quick sketches or diagrams.

The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril’s only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine’s SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven’t fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don’t indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

Or could his fame, his track record, his now unrestricted voice, and a fast-growing audience trigger the very implosion he's predicting?", "content": "While you’ve been sweating the details over Thanksgiving, famed investor Michael Burry – the one portrayed by Christian Bale played in “The Big Short” – has been waging an increasingly aggressive war against Nvidia. It’s a battle worth watching because Burry might actually win it. What makes this different from every other warning about an AI bubble is that Burry now has the audience and the freedom from regulatory constraints to potentially become the catalyst for the very collapse he’s predicting. He’s betting against the AI boom, but he’s also proactively trying to convince his growing number of followers that the emperor – Nvidia – has no clothes. What everyone is now wondering is whether Burry can create enough doubt to truly hobble Nvidia and, by association, the other main characters in this story, including OpenAI. Burry has really thrown himself into the effort in recent weeks. He’s been slinging mud at Nvidia; he also traded nasty comments with Palantir CEO Alex Karp after regulatory filings revealed Burry held bearish put options on both companies – a bet worth over $1 billion that they’d crash . (Karp went on CNBC and called Burry’s strategy “ batshit crazy ,” to which Burry responded by mocking Karp for not understanding how to read an SEC filing.) The spat encapsulates the market’s central divide: is AI going to transform everything and thus worth every billion invested, or are we now in mania territory that’s destined to end badly? Burry’s allegations are specific and damning. He says Nvidia’s stock-based compensation has cost shareholders $112.5 billion, essentially “reducing owner’s earnings by 50%.” He has suggested that AI companies are cooking their books by slow-walking depreciation on equipment that’s losing value fast. (Burry believes that Nvidia customers are overstating the useful lives of Nvidia’s GPUs in order to justify runaway capital expenditures.)

This week, Startup Battlefield editor Isabelle Johannessen is joined by the winner of this year’s competition , Kevin Damoa, the CEO and founder of Glīd , a logistics infrastructure company that aims to streamline the complex container shipment process. Damoa first discovered the challenges of shipping larger cargo as a new enlistee in the U.S. Army , where he worked on a team loading tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles onto the railroad. He learned firsthand that while railways don’t have the same congestion as roads, they come with their own set of problems. The biggest one ended up being the complex multistep process of moving cargo from the roads to the rails. Cut to 2025, and Damoa is standing on the TechCrunch Disrupt stage holding the giant check, having just beaten 200 other companies to win the Startup Battlefield competition. In this week’s episode of Build Mode, TechCrunch’s new postcast for builders and entrepreneurs, Damoa breaks down how he found the hardware and software solution to the logistics issues he’d seen firsthand. And he does a deep dive into how the team came together to ensure those three products (launched nearly simultaneously) were ready for a live demo on the Disrupt stage. “Oh that was crazy, making sure the software works,” Damoa said. “And anybody that knows software knows that it takes an army of people,” which was something that Glīd at this stage doesn’t have. But that pressure, and very public deadline, gave the team a focus and drive to get their house in order more swiftly than ever.

The startup JustiGuide claims it can help with that thanks to an AI-powered portal. The idea is to help immigrants in the U.S. — and eventually in other countries — understand the law and what visas they may be eligible for, and to connect with immigration attorneys, making the whole process cheaper and faster. “I think the more we make the technology accessible, I think people will be empowered to try and fill their own forms and understand what their options are and that they will be able to use lawyers for just the review process,” JustiGuide’s founder Bisi Obateru told TechCrunch. Obateru, who is from Nigeria, recalled how he had to navigate the U.S. immigration system after he finished his studies in the country. Since then, he got an H1-B visa, a common visa for tech workers, and then a permanent residency green card. That inspired him to launch JustiGuide to help fellow immigrants. “Immigrants can come in and basically speak in their native tongue and understand what their immigration journey can be,” he said. The company won best pitch in the Policy + Protection category at TechCrunch’s Disrupt conference this year. JustiGuide’s customers, according to Obateru, are startup founders who need help hiring immigrants, individuals who have an H1-B and are looking for other options, international students thinking of starting their own business, as well as lawyers and law firms. But he also hopes that one day perhaps government institutions will also want to license the technology. The platform consists of an AI legal research assistant, a system that pairs lawyers and immigrants, and it promises to speed up the process of filling out forms. The latter is done by giving lawyers a service that helps them compile documents and streamline processes that a paralegal may otherwise do, Obateru explained. According to Obateru, the platform, which has 47,000 users, relies on an AI he c", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/justiguide-wants-to-use-ai-to-help-people-navigate-the-u-s-immigration-system/", "timestamp": 1764487774.765753}

On Tuesday, OpenAI responded to the lawsuit with a filing of its own, arguing that it shouldn’t be held responsible for the teenager’s death. OpenAI claims that over roughly nine months of usage, ChatGPT directed Raine to seek help more than 100 times. But according to his parents’ lawsuit, Raine was able to circumvent the company’s safety features to get ChatGPT to give him “technical specifications for everything from drug overdoses to drowning to carbon monoxide poisoning,” helping him to plan what the chatbot called a “beautiful suicide.” Since Raine maneuvered around its guardrails, OpenAI claims that he violated its terms of use, which state that users “may not … bypass any protective measures or safety mitigations we put on our Services.” The company also argues that its FAQ page warns users not to rely on ChatGPT’s output without independently verifying it. “OpenAI tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act,” Jay Edelson, a lawyer representing the Raine family, said in a statement. OpenAI included excerpts from Adam’s chat logs in its filing, which it says provide more context to his conversations with ChatGPT. The transcripts were submitted to the court under seal, meaning they are not publicly available, so we were unable to view them. However, OpenAI said that Raine had a history of depression and suicidal ideation that predated his use of ChatGPT and that he was taking a medication that could make suicidal thoughts worse. Edelson said OpenAI’s response has not adequately addressed the family’s concerns. “OpenAI and Sam Altman have no explanation for the last hours of Adam’s life, when ChatGPT gave him a pep talk and then offered to write a suicide note,” ", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/26/openai-claims-teen-circumvented-safety-features-before-suicide-that-chatgpt-helped-plan/", "timestamp": 1764487774.8669465}

Nevada-based Redwood employees around 1,200 employees, so the cuts affect a few dozen workers. The company, founded in 2017 by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, initially focused on recycling scrap from battery cell production, consumer electronics, and used EV batteries. The company extracts materials like cobalt, nickel, and lithium from those discarded goods and then sells them back to its customers, which include Panasonic. Redwood has since added cathode production. It recently launched a new business that uses those old EV batteries in energy storage products — a sector that has taken off during the boom of power-hungry AI data centers. As of June, the company had stockpiled more than 1 gigawatt-hour’s worth of batteries for this purpose. The $350 million Series E, announced in October, boosted the company’s valuation to around $6 billion, as TechCrunch previously reported . A spokesperson declined to comment on the layoffs.

It wasn't until I started testing chef's knives earlier this year that I realized how important it is to invest a little bit in the tool you'll most likely be using every day for years (or even decades if you keep up with maintenance). I didn't realize that using a cheap, very dull knife as my daily driver was slowing down my cooking process, making less effective cuts, and even putting me at risk of injury, as the blade was dull and caused me to apply more pressure (which in turn made things more dangerous). I'm a believer in the importance of investing in A Good-Ass Knife. Plus, they make seriously wonderful presents. Every kitchen (and home chef) needs a solid chef's knife to slice, dice, and chop ingredients with speed and precision. Most people get knife sets ( which I think are baloney, BTW ) for wedding presents and then slack on proper maintenance, causing the knives to dull and degrade quickly. Chances are, the person you're shopping for this holiday season (even if it's yourself!) needs a better go-to knife for their kitchen. I'm absolutely obsessed with these gorgeous, USA-made chef's knives from New West KnifeWorks.

Hitting too close to home? I feel you. I mean I want a new camera. I want the Sony A7C R, which is an amazing camera. The autofocus is light year's ahead of my A7R II, the sensor is bigger, the dynamic range is better, and it's smaller and lighter. What's not to love? But it isn't going to instantly make me take better pictures. To make better images you have to spend time at it. It takes practice, shooting everyday, even if you only have 10 minutes. Walk around the neighborhood and play with different compositions, try shooting in ways you normally don't. Experiment with different light at different times of the day. Just get out an shoot more.

Bonus: It’s certified by the Clean Label Project. Promix Amazon Promix Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is a highly digestible protein powder that has been micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, which makes it suitable for individuals with sensitive stomachs. Each scoop delivers 30 grams of protein, as well as 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids.

At 1.8 pounds, it's light enough to pick up after an intense workout, and the 60-watt brushless motor delivers relatively quiet percussions. It has three speed settings and five interchangeable heads (fork, ball, cushion, flat, and bullet), and it's built with a pressure sensor that lets you know when you're pushing too hard, kind of like an electric toothbrush.

As it turns out, Black Friday this year is turning out to be a great time to buy some of our favorite carry-on luggage , packing cubes , and toiletry bags , all of which are on sale. So, here are the best Black Friday travel gear deals on products we've tested and loved. One of the most impressive discounts is on the Travelpro Platinum Elite, which is one of our favorite carry-on rollaboard suitcases . Normally $368, it's now 46 percent off, bringing the price to $150 . That takes it from the high-end pricing to much more affordable. Travelpro Amazon Travelpro We're a big fan of Travelpro as a brand, and as WIRED editor Adrienne So says, its bags are “durable, light, and not too expensive.” It's why so often they're the travel bag of choice for pilots and flight attendants. Our top pick, the new Maxlite Air V2 , is an updated polycarbonate version of the older nylon model, especially noteworthy for being a pound lighter than many of the other carry-on bags we've tested. It's also on sale, but only 20 percent off. While the Maxlite Air V2 is a smaller, lighter bag, the Platinum Elite has features like the built-in battery for charging devices on the go and an accessible side pocket for your back-up battery. You can't wrong either way, but the normal $220 difference between these two models is now down to just $15 for Black Friday. Admittedly, these Travelpro bags have a classic look, but they're not exactly trendy. So, if you want something a bit more modern-looking, I'd point you in the direction of another of our favorite travel bands, Away.

The company offers some of the best Black Friday streaming deals with a ridiculously low-priced $3/month offer for basic HBO Max (it's the version with ads and 2K streaming, but still, super-cheap). Disney Plus and Hulu Black Friday deals are bundled up for $5/month . Apple TV wants back in your life for $6 . Of course, this deal is only meant for new customers.

Another method is by using an alternate email account (perhaps your spouse's or roommate's?) and alternate payment information as a new customer.

I reviewed the model with the Core Ultra 7 258V, but either way, you're getting really good battery life and integrated graphics performance. Most importantly, it avoids the two main pitfalls of budget laptops: poor displays and touchpads. The Dell 14 Plus comes with a high-resolution display (2560 x 1600) and a very smooth-feeling touchpad.

Basepaws Amazon Amazon Basepaws Basepaws Amazon Amazon (2-Pack) Basepaws Basepaws has one breed and health test for cats, which identifies up to 21 breeds, 64 genetic health markers, 50 genetic trait markers, blood type, and oral health; and one for dogs, which identifies more than 330 breeds, more than 280 genetic health markers, and more than 30 genetic trait markers. All you have to do is register your kit, set up an account and your pet's profile, swab your pet's mouth, send it back in the self-addressed packet, and in about five weeks, results will show up in your email and online account. Then, perhaps best of all, you can send them to your vet so they can access your pet's data to ensure they have the most up-to-date health information for the next vet visit or (dog forbid!) emergency trip. I compared Basepaws against Wisdom Panel , the other most popular at-home test kit for pets, and while I liked Wisdom Panel's interface a bit more, Basepaws had a lot more health information. This is especially the case for cats: Basepaws was able to tell me my cats' blood type and transfusion risk—super helpful information for my vet to have, especially in an emergency or surgery situation. I found the oral health report to be extremely helpful, too—both of my cats have halitosis and are at risk for dental disease.

Julian Chokkattu 17 hours ago Little Chonk Amazon Little Chonk I’ve tried a lot of doggie water bottles since 2017—when I got my dog—and the Lil Gulp is easily the best. The trench swings open, and you can let water out via the button and put it back into the bottle by tilting it and holding the button. I like that you can hold it while your pup drinks, or lay it flat on the ground like a bowl. There’s a nice strap to grab it from, and there’s the option to add the company’s charcoal filters if you’re worried about water quality. (You don’t need to use the filters.) It hasn’t ever leaked for me, and it also looks cute as heck.

In fact, in recent years, some of the most high-profile and brazen digital attacks around the world have been carried out by teens.

And whether you've never given much thought to your digital privacy and security or you've started to rein in your data, you can use this guide to implement basic precautions and keep operations security in mind. In other words, this guide contains advice and ideas to help you conceptualize how people can find out information about you from your digital activities—and start to minimize what’s out there in ways you didn’t intend. Protecting your digital privacy isn't a blanket prescription. Some people are more private by nature, and others prioritize putting themselves out there. But even if you're a 24/7 streamer, you can still think about your operations security, commonly known as opsec. What can viewers see in your room while you're streaming? Which people from your life have appeared onscreen? Could viewers figure out where you live from what they can see out your window? These same types of questions can be adapted for any type of onlooker—from the tech companies that operate the platforms you use to people browsing your social media or dating profiles or a friend (FORMER FRIEND) looking over your shoulder at your phone. In digital operations security, “operations” are the things that make up online activity like messages, searches, AI chats, websites, photos, accounts, passwords, and so on. The “security” piece has two goals. One is secrecy: No one sees stuff they shouldn’t. The other is availability: You don’t lose access to your data and accounts. Opsec is hard, because secrecy and availability conflict. The more secret you make things, the easier it is to accidentally lock yourself out and vice versa. Good security is a balance.

That's where “Find my phone” capability comes in handy. Just ask a nearby family member or friend to use the feature built into their phone’s OS to ping the lost device, and it makes a loud noise that helps you find it. The problem: not everyone uses the same phone operating system. In my house, I have an iPhone and my wife has an Android . This means when I inevitably leave my phone in a hotel couch, she can't really help me find it. Sure, she could call my phone number, but I usually have my ringer off and Do Not Disturb enabled. (I'm annoying like that.) She obviously can't use Apple’s Find My iPhone, which doesn’t run on her Android device. And while both Apple and Google offer tools to see the location of paired devices from a computer, the computer that's nearby may not be set up with the proper permissions. Am I doomed to keep track of where my phone is, like a functional adult? No, thanks to a simple app called RingIt by Belgian developer Gaëtan Van Den Berge . This application, which is free for both Android and iOS, exists to make it easier for Android users to help iPhone users find their phone, and vice-versa. Just open the app, hit a button, and the other person's phone will ring—loudly—helping them to find their phone. \"The idea for RingIt actually came to me on vacation with my girlfriend,\" Van Den Berge tells me. \"I kept misplacing my phone, often while it was on silent, and I’d repeatedly ask her, 'Do you know where my phone is?' I remember thinking how nice it would be if she could just make my phone ring loudly from her own device, even if mine was muted.\" And so he made an application that does exactly this, and nothing else. The application doesn't collect location or any user data—just email addresses that are used for verification. Setting up the application is easy: just install the app on your phone.

Even folks who have yet to dip their toe into the sex toy world have heard about the best vibrators and the innovation sex tech has brought us this century. Originally, they were merely crude dildos that just happened to vibrate. Thankfully, that’s no longer the case. As a deeper understanding of the human anatomy has come to light, vibrators are designed to transcend archaic stereotypes about what sexual pleasure should be. Vibrators today come in all shapes and sizes. Some look more like art than something that makes you go weak in the knees. What’s most important remains: These are sex toys that use internal motors to stimulate erogenous zones. Yes, zones plural; vibrators aren't just for vulvas. Phalluses and nipples also respond well to stimulation with the right rumbly sensations, as do the perineum, the insides of the thighs, and even the lower abdomen and nape of the neck. Most of the vibrators on this list have been tested on vulvas, phalluses, and the extensive network of erogenous zones all over the body. Regardless of your gender, your genitals, or your sexual preferences, there's something here that can give you sensations you never thought possible.

Over the past few years, I have tested dozens, ranging from the fastest gaming keyboards to those offering elevated typing experiences.

With keyboard advances over the past few years, you can’t go wrong with anything in this guide—everything I recommend is well-built, sturdy, and feels great to type on.

There are some pretty obvious clues, after all. If you travel south, you see stars and constellations you’ve never seen before (because they’re blocked by Earth’s curvature). When a ship comes into port, you see the top of it before the bottom (because the ocean surface is curved). Finally, when Earth's shadow falls on the moon in a lunar eclipse, the shadow is a circle. I mean, c’mon! But this is impressive: Around 240 BC, the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, head of the famous Library of Alexandria in Egypt, came up with a brilliant way to calculate the radius of the spherical Earth. You can do it too, and it doesn’t require any fancy equipment. I'm going to show you how to measure the Earth’s size using Lego pieces. Of course, Eratosthenes didn’t have Legos. But he knew that at noon on the summer solstice, the sun shone straight down a vertical well in Syene, Egypt. This meant the sun was directly overhead. So what did he do? He stuck a pole in the ground in Alexandria, and at noon on the same day he found that it cast a shadow, meaning the sun wasn’t overhead there. In the picture below, I’ve used a pole in Syene (not to scale, obviously) instead of a well, but it’s the same idea. You can see that if the sun is in line with the Syene pole, it won’t be in line with the Alexandria pole. This could only mean the Earth is curved. But, yeah, he knew that. Now to find the size of the Earth, he needed just two numbers, the angle of the shadow in Alexandria and the distance between the two cities. He found the shadow angle to be 7.2 degrees from the vertical—but to be general, let's call this theta ( θ ). Using basic geometry, this meant the two cities were θ degrees apart on Earth’s 360-degree circumference. At this point, all he needed was the distance between the two cities—the arc length—which I’ll call s . Maybe he hired someone to pace it off, but in any case he got a distance o", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-measure-the-earths-radius-with-legos/", "timestamp": 1764487787.9173036}

This is the only sale of the year for Unbound Merino (though you can sign up for the mailing list, which offers coupons and deals), and it’s a great chance to round out your travel wardrobe with some excellent merino wool. Better hurry though, unlike most sales, Unbound Merino's Black Friday sale ends tonight. From casual, everyday T-shirts, to underwear, socks, and great merino travel pants, Unbound has a little something for everyone. We've combed through the site and found a few of our favorite deals. Be sure to see our guide to the Best Merino Wool T-shirts , Best Merino Wool Clothes , and the Best Base Layers for more great merino wool options. What’s So Great About Merino Wool? Merino wool is great because you're stealing a sheep's ability to keep itself warm or cool based on the temperatures it's in. This is a process often referred to as thermoregulation. Merino sheep have thinner, softer wool than what most people think of when they think of wool. The sheep evolved this soft coat to keep them comfortable across a wide range of temperatures. The result is a fabric that's comfortable to wear next to your skin. For the softest tees, look for fabrics that are either superfine or ultrafine—anything 17 µm or higher—like Unbound's T-shirts. Wool is sustainable, too. One sheep can produce 4 to 5 pounds of wool per year. While cotton has its place, and so does the occasional synthetic garment, merino wool is a remarkable fabric that's the cornerstone of my wardrobe. I don't think you can have too many merino pieces in your closet, but they’re not cheap, which is why we're featuring these deals. What’s So Great About Unbound Merino? I like Unbound's T-shirts because they're 100 percent merino wool, no synthetics involved. That means all the antibacterial, odor-resistant, moisture-wicking, temperature-regulating goodness of merino wool … ", "url": "https://www.wired.com/story/unbound-merino-black-friday-sale-2025/", "timestamp": 1764487788.3988872}

The merger has also catapulted banks’ loan market share (m/s) by 330 bps to 14.5% while rise in deposits m/s is slower at 110bps YoY to 11.0%. We estimate the bank to deliver solid 18% CAGR in deposits for FY24-26 (absolute rise of INR 4.0-5.0 trillion per year) which also accounts for changed competitive landscape. Despite strong deposits growth, the bank is likely to focus on balanced LDR and borrowing substitution; thus we cut our loan growth estimate to 13% CAGR for FY24-26 with LDR easing to 100/96% for FY25/26 vs 104% now. Our implied incremental LDR comes at 74-75%. Overall, deposits accretion remains key variable impacting growth and NIM. Outlook While Q4FY24 NIM outcome was slightly better than expected, it appears partly driven by seasonality. We cut our EPS estimate by 5% for both FY25/26, mainly due to cut in growth estimates. We estimate the bank to deliver healthy RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26 with 14–15% RoE. Our target price remains unchanged at INR 1,850. Due to the sharp correction in stock price (down 10% YTD), we upgrade the stock to BUY. The re-rating is likely to be gradual as despite strong deposits growth, credit growth is likely to remain bit slower versus system and borrowing substitution is also likely to be gradual.

Post de-merger, ABFRL plans to raise Rs25bn in the remnant entity, to support growth/debt reduction, while new entity ABLBL should generate healthy cash flows.

IT services EBIT margin at 16.4%, up 40bps QoQ, is better than 10bps QoQ expansion estimate of the street. Segmental margin improved 50bps/10bps QoQ for Americas-2/APMEA margin improvement was supported by better utilisation (up 290bps QoQ) and offshoring (60bps QoQ). Outlook Wipro has reported in-line earnings in Q4FY24, with better execution at margin front. Bookings were strong at USD 3.6bn. IT services EBIT margin was impressive, up 40bps QoQ, despite headwinds from wage hikes and revenue decline. Highlights from Q4 include: 1) Recovery in Capco and 2) new CEO’s strategy of doubling down on execution. We are sceptical on Capco growth, which appears more like positive seasonality and a result of low base effect. We presume the CEO’s strategic pivot towards better execution and large deal focus as a long-term play and see limited positive triggers in short-medium term as Wipro’s portfolio carries a high discretionary component (reflected in muted FY25 revenue guidance of -1.5% to 0.5%). We value Wipro at 16x (unchanged), on FY26E EPS of INR 26 (FY25-26E EPS kept largely unchanged) to arrive at our TP of INR 410 (vs INR 397 earlier).

Margin profile is similar in these cities and focus will be on selling longer-tenor products, based on mortality and persistency.

EBIT of INR 76,210 Mn (+2.4% YoY) fell behind our estimates by 6.1% due to higher-than-expected cost of sales; EBIT margins contracted by 94 bps YoY.

In Q4FY24, the attrition rate stood at 12.6%, exceeding our base case estimate of 11.2% by 140 bps. We apply a reduced multiple of 21.0x on FY26E EPS to reflect top-line weakness and margin pressure. We lower our Target Price (TP) to INR 1,531 per share, with an ACCUMULATE rating. Outlook Accordingly, we reduce our Target Price to INR 1,531 per share (previously: INR 1,772), which implies an 6.9% upside over the CMP.

The company has, in the past, reduced capex per tower factoring in lower tenancy addition; therefore, we expect VIL’s tenancy growth to fuel capex for Indus with investments in power back-up and reinforcing tower strength. We estimate capex intensity at 45% and 32% of revenue for FY25E and FY26E, respectively. This means capex will likely remain elevated for Indus at INR 70–90bn p.a., which will likely restrict FCF generation. Capex intensity is only expected moderate from FY27E when growth tapers. Outlook Our valuation for Indus now bakes in the VIL capex. Our recalibrated model envisions Indus’ rental revenue/EBITDA/ net profit CAGRs of 9.3%/10.2%/14.4% over FY24–27E. That said, EPS growth will likely plummet to mid-single-digits soon after, succumbing to a more mature tower industry, which will entail incremental requirements drying up and offering limited growth opportunities. We see Indus’ FCF generation and dividend story taking shape FY27E onwards. We lower WACC and lift the terminal growth rate for Indus – implies restoring VIL’s going concern status that is yet to be established. Our DCF-based TP is now INR 260 (earlier INR 200); however, CMP implies earnings growth of 10% over FY24E–31E – a stretched assumption. Downgrade to SELL (from Reduce).

Over the past couple of quarters, the bank seems to have addressed legacy issues impacting loan growth (better internal control, run-down of KCC gold loan, etc.) and has overhauled its IT systems (new LOS running in-parallel with the support of BCG and Newgen) improving TAT, customer experience and risk monitoring. Importantly, the bank has hired lateral talent and intends to chase growth via new products (both secured and unsecured) while augmenting non-branch channel. Outlook CUBK stands favourably on LDR (at 81% as of Q3FY24 vs 84% YoY), LCR (264%) and tier 1 (>20%). Receding drag from legacy issues, improved IT systems and focus on new products / channels impart healthy visibility of growth accelerating to 13-15% YoY vs 5-6% YoY in FY24E. While cost to income is likely to see pressure due to elevated investments in the business, we believe the bank should see broadly stable RoAs of 1.4-1.5% for FY24-26E, driven by easing credit costs. Valuation is attractive at 1.3/1.1x FY25/26E ABV, significantly lower than its 3-year mean of 1.5x.

The SIR exercise is currently underway in the states and UTs of Uttar Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala , Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The TMC has repeatedly raised concerns about the SIR process, alleging bias, administrative pressure and lapses in voter roll management. At Friday’s meeting, the party described the Commission’s responses as “outright lies”, widening the rift between the two sides. Last week, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee publicly voiced “serious concerns” over the SIR and urged the ECI to intervene. With allegations circulating about BLO deaths and excessive workloads, the Commission agreed to meet with the TMC delegation, but Friday’s exchange appeared to deepen tensions rather than resolve them. The TMC has claimed that 41 people, including BLOs, have died, some allegedly by suicide, since the SIR process began, a charge the BJP has dismissed as \"baseless and politically motivated\".

Trump has declared Venezuelan airspace should be closed, raising speculation of potential military action.", "content": "US President Donald Trump intensified his threats toward Venezuela on Saturday, issuing a stark warning that the country’s airspace should be regarded as “closed\". Following months of deadly US attacks on suspected drug-smuggling vessels, speculation is growing that Washington could carry out a military operation in Venezuela, according to AFP . Trump's warning follows days after US aviation authorities advised airlines to exercise increased caution near Venezuela due to rising tensions, prompting several major carriers to suspend flights. He stated this week that efforts to stop Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would start “very soon”, the report noted. “To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers. Please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY,” Trump said in a Truth social post from his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. In recent months, the US has stepped up pressure on Caracas as part of a counter-narcotics effort targeting drug trafficking, which the Trump administration claims is orchestrated by Maduro’s regime. The administration has labelled Venezuela’s Cartel de los Soles as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, citing this designation as legal justification for certain operations, while Venezuela contends it is a false pretext for intervention. Trump also claims that the cartel is headed by the Venezuelan president. A report by Bloomberg said that as part of Trump's Venezuela strategy, the US has increased its military presence in the region, deploying an aircraft carrier and warships and sending senior military officials to meet with leaders across the Caribbean. Caracas, seeing the substantial US military presence in the Caribbean as an effort to force out President Nicolas Maduro, condemned Trump's warning as a “colonialist threat”.

What has Delhi inherited over the years that led to this decline? The second should chart the road ahead — listing immediate, short-term and long-term measures, assigned clearly to responsible departments as well as citizens. Everyone, she emphasised, is both “a contributor and a solution”. Alongside strict enforcement, Bedi pushed for large-scale awareness campaigns through media and educational platforms to ensure collective responsibility. Bedi argued that Delhi needs less paperwork and more field-level action. She urged officers and civic authorities to step outdoors daily, inspect problem spots such as dusty roads and construction zones, and act on violations in real time rather than waiting for reports. Only then, she said, can coordination truly improve across agencies. Bedi also reached out to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, recalling how his virtual reviews during her tenure in Puducherry boosted efficiency across departments. She said recurring meetings between the PM, Delhi and neighbouring states — even monthly — could prevent seasonal spikes and fragmented responses. She outlined that environmental ministries and the Commission for Air Quality Management must ensure consistent compliance across the NCR, while state governments, municipal bodies and district magistrates must enforce daily checks on industrial emissions, construction rules, road dust and traffic congestion. Criticising the heavy use of air purifiers in government offices and official vehicles, she questioned how insulated officials can underst", "url": "https://www.livemint.com/news/india/who-failed-delhi-kiran-bedi-seeks-white-paper-monthly-reviews-led-by-pm-modi-to-tackle-pollution-crisis-11764481304191.html", "timestamp": 1764487844.4830177}

Here's how much petrol and diesel cost in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai on November 30.", "content": "Fuel prices today : Petrol and diesel prices remain a key focus for most consumers and businesses in India, as price adjustments are expected to impact commercial entities that rely heavily on fuel for their operations. Fuel rates are updated daily at 6:00 am in India. Since June 2017, fuel prices have been revised daily using the dynamic fuel price method. This approach updates oil prices every day to mirror current global oil rates and currency exchange fluctuations. Retail buyers should remember fuel prices may differ from state to state, taking into account taxes , transportation costs and other related factors. Notably, prices have remained unchanged for several months now.  Here's how much petrol and diesel cost in Delhi , Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai today, according to the latest data posted by Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, a government body that collects and analyses data related to the oil and gas sector. Petrol price – ₹ 94.77 Diesel price – ₹ 87.67 Petrol price – ₹ 103.5 Diesel price – ₹ 90.03 Petrol price – ₹ 105.41 Diesel price – ₹ 92.02 Petrol price – ₹ 110.8 Diesel price – ₹ 92.39  India imports more than 80% of its oil requirements, so domestic fuel prices are largely determined by international prices. Other factors influencing domestic petrol and diesel prices include central excise duty, VAT (value-added tax) levied by state governments, dealer and refining margins, and transportation costs. Currently, petrol and diesel are not subject to GST. Since several factors impact fuel prices, no single reason can be solely responsible for any price changes. Often, several factors together cause price fluctuations. Disclaimer : This story is for educational purposes only.

After the 15-minute leaked clip went viral, the Palli Gram TV creator and his girlfriend issued an emotional apology to fans on their respective Instagram handles, claiming that the video was leaked by someone whom they once trusted \"like a brother\". The couple has since garnered a lot of support from Sofik's loyal fans . Sofik SK is a Bengali content creator with over half a million followers on social media. He often makes videos featuring his partner and fellow content creator, Dustu Sonali. The Palli Gram TV creator has nearly 45 videos on Instagram, most of which show him dancing and lip-syncing to songs. Dustu Sonali's Instagram bio lists her as an “artist”. Currently, she has nearly 312,000 followers and 130 posts. She often features in videos shared by Sofik SK. Addressing the issue on their individual handles, the couple blamed their friend for leaking the private video, claiming that he was blackmailing them. Dustu Sonali clarified that it was a private moment between her and her boyfriend, and leaking a video of it has ruined her life; she is currently unable to leave her house. She also shared that she has filed a case against the said friend and plans to drag his family if he escalates the matter. Meanwhile, an emotional Sofik SK said that he considered the friend like a brother and had trusted him with the passwords to both their phones. \"Even I didn't have this video. My girlfriend had it. We trusted a friend with our phones, who knew our passwords,\" he said. \"He took the video and used it to blackmail us. When I stopped contact, he posted it online.

On November 28, Parsa Tajik, a member of the technical staff at xAI, shared that he had worked for nearly 36 hours non-stop. “Last night I left the @xai office after ~36 hours of working with no sleep. Although I was dead, I was also super energised. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team. Happy Thanksgiving!” he wrote on X. The post instantly sparked backlash online, with users calling it an unhealthy sign of hustle culture and an unsustainable workplace ethic. Responding to the viral discussion, Ayush Jaiswal — who works on the Grok team at xAI and is of Indian origin — reacted with a tongue-in-cheek endorsement of the grind. “Work life balance is great, in-fact we recommend it to all our competitors,” Jaiswal posted, adding a follow-up line seemingly aimed at critics: “Don’t be angry with this post. You’re free to disagree & let us cook.” The comment drew mixed reactions, with many pointing out the growing concerns around burnout in the tech industry. Meanwhile, Ayush Jaiswal, previously shared his impression of the company’s work culture. In an earlier post on X, he described the Palo Alto office as high-intensity but free from toxicity or office politics. Jaiswal had said that the environment carried “an incredible amount of intensity” while maintaining “zero toxicity or politics,” calling it a uniquely positive atmosphere in Silicon Valley. Jaiswal’s quip also echoed a widely-circulated remark from Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha. In 2024, Palicha joked that he fully supports work-life balance — “especially for the competition”. He later admitted on a podcast that the post was a “stupid idea” in hindsight.

The figures, which are not adjusted for inflation, draw from both online and in-person purchases to give a broad view of economic activity. The data shows US shoppers’ resilience amid higher costs and job-market concerns. To appeal to price-sensitive consumers, retailers are offering discounts on a wide range of goods — although the promotions may not be quite as deep as in past years. Companies are also highlighting newer, exclusive items for the season, ranging from $10 couch throws to $5 Barbie dolls. The holiday season is a key barometer for consumer demand, with executives, economists and investors closely watching households’ spending habits. While shoppers tend to splurge at the end of the year on gifts, trends have started to shift and higher costs across the economy have fueled concern that consumers will buy fewer items. In-store sales rose 1.7%, above last year’s pace. Online sales rose 10.4%, lower than last year’s gain. “It clearly shows that the consumer has the ability to spend,” Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, said in an interview. Despite macroeconomic swings, shoppers appear to have purchasing power and were spending at a consistent level heading into Black Friday.

Albanese married his partner Jodie Haydon in a small ceremony at the prime minister’s official residence in Canberra on Saturday – making him the first Aussie PM to get married while in office. The Australian PM's wedding comes after the final sitting day of the Australian parliament for 2025 on Friday, and six months on from Albanese’s landslide re-election victory. Earlier this month, Albanese had hailed ties between India and Australia as a ‘very strong one’ – when he and PM Modi held a bilateral meeting in Johannesburg – on the sidelines of the G20 Leaders' Summit. During the meeting on November 21, Albanese expressed condolences over the Red Fort terrorist attack and the bus crash in Saudi Arabia, in which several Indian Umrah pilgrims lost their lives. “We have much to discuss, and our relationship is very strong. I think the economic relationship we can strengthen further, and our defence and security ties are also very important going forward. And I look forward to our discussion today,” Albanese had said that time. PM Anthony Albanese's wedding on Saturday is his second marriage after his 19-year marriage to his first wife, former NSW politician Carmel Tebbutt, ended in 2019, as per ABC News. He has one son, Nathan, from his previous marriage. The wedding took place on Saturday afternoon at Albanese’s official residence, the Lodge, witnessed by a small group of close family and friends, including Albanese’s son, Nathan, and Haydon’s parents, Bill and Pauline. According to a report by ABC News , Jodie Haydon and Albanese have been together for five years.

According to recent reports, she has warned she will pursue legal remedies if the film “misrepresents or maligns” his image. In ‘Dhurandhar’, veteran actor Sanjay Dutt is cast as Chaudhary Aslam — described in promotional material as the tough Lyari-based police officer who fought against gangsters and terrorists. According to a statement shared with PTI, Aslam’s widow, Naureen Aslam, condemned a specific line from the trailer that referred to her late husband as a “child of the devil and a jinn.” She said, “We are Muslims, and such words are disrespectful to not only Aslam but his mother as well, who was a simple, honest woman.” She added: “If I see my husband being portrayed wrongly or any propaganda against him in the film, I will definitely take all legal steps I can.” Naureen also expressed broader concerns that filmmakers appear to target Pakistani figures to malign the country. “It is strange that Indian filmmakers find no other subjects but to malign Pakistan ,” she said. Aslam’s family emphasises that his legacy was one of courage, integrity and unflinching service. “My husband was a brave and courageous police officer and his name was feared by criminals and terrorists,” Naureen stated, referring to Aslam’s work against crime syndicates. She also disputed some characterisations, suggesting that even major criminals had been exaggerated into “terrorist” status, while in reality they were accused of extortion, kidnapping or criminality. ‘Dhurandhar’, directed by Aditya Dhar, is among the most talked-about film projects of the year. The trailer’s gritty depiction of gang-wars and crime, combined with a star-studded cast including Sanjay Dutt, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Rampal, Akshaye Khanna , and R Madhavan, has drawn widespread attention, as well as criticism.

In 2022, Umerov headed Ukraine's State Property Fund, but was best known for negotiating with Russia and for organising successful prisoner exchanges, BBC had reported earlier. Umerov stepped in as charge of the Ukrainian delegation after Zelensky's powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak abruptly resigned on Friday — just hours after anti-corruption investigators searched his apartment. Zelensky, in a social media post on X said he expected that the results of previous meetings with the US in Geneva, which took place last weekend, would now be \"hammered out\" on Sunday. Rustem Umerov replaced Andriy Yermak as Ukraine security council secretary.  Though not entirely unfamiliar to Ukrainian politics, Umerov – reportedly – has rarely been in the public eye. Born in exile, the Crimean Tatar is an active member of the ethnic community. Rustem Umerov came into politics in 2019 when he ran for parliament with the reformist \"Holos\" party, which he later left to become a government official. Before that he worked in the private sector, first in telecoms and later in investment. Speaking about the peace talks, Zelensky posted on X that Rustem had already delivered a report on Saturday. \"Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,\" Zelensky wrote on X. Meanwhile, hours after his resignation, Yermak told the New York Post hours after his resignation that he was \"going to the front\". “I am an honest and decent person,” he said. Yermak was the key interlocutor with Kyiv’s Western allies and was widely seen as the second-most powerful man in the Ukrainian government, mentioned a report by Politico.

IMD further warned of heavy rainfall at isolated spots, likely over Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, Villuppuram, Chengalpattu districts, and the Puducherry-Karaikal region.  Strong winds and rainfall have already hit the coastal areas of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu. As reported by ANI, on preparations related to Cyclone Ditwah, Joint Collector of Nellore, Mogili Venkateswarlu said, “...Most areas of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry were affected by this cyclone, but in Nellore district, only moderate rains occurred today. All district-level staff have been alerted, and various departments have taken precautionary measures. Guidance has been issued to district-level officers, and all departments are ensuring necessary precautions.…” In Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, heavy rainfall has caused excess water from the city and nearby areas to drain toward the Port Trust coastline and merge with the sea, which has been unusually rough. Strong sea activity has pushed large amounts of marine algae and other seabed vegetation ashore. The district administration has urged residents to remain cautious amid the heavy rain and turbulent sea conditions and to avoid coastal areas unless necessary.  IMD has stated that Cyclone Ditwah is likely to move North-Northwest (NNW) and will approach the North Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and South Andhra Pradesh coasts by tomorrow.  The cyclone will come within 25 km of the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government has set up 6000 camps all over the state, Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management KKSSR Ramachandran said on Saturday. \"We have placed as many camps for people to stay in the cyclone-affected areas.

Trump claimed that the prices have dropped 500%, 600%, 700% because he invoked favored nations status for the United States of America. However, the US President did not share any data or evidence to prove his claim. “No other President has been able to do this, BUT I HAVE! This is also the answer to much less expensive, and far better, HEALTHCARE! Republicans, remember, this was done by us, and nobody else,” Trump said in a post on X. Claiming that this is a revolution in medicine, the biggest and most important event, EVER, Trump added, “If this story is properly told, we should win the Midterm Elections in RECORD NUMBERS. I AM THE AFFORDABILITY PRESIDENT. TALK LOUDLY AND PROUDLY.” A few days ago, the US Medicare health plan said on Tuesday that newly negotiated prices for 15 of its costliest drugs will save 36% on those medications compared with recent annual spending, or about $8.5 billion in net covered prescription costs. The annual price negotiations were established under President Joe Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. Previously, Medicare was barred by law from negotiating with drugmakers. According to Reuters report, the Trump administration has since outlined what it considers most-favored-nation pricing terms: the lowest price in any country that is part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with a gross domestic product per capita of at least 60% of US GDP per capita. Under a separate pilot program, Medicare has proposed a smaller “country basket,” which includes six G-7 countries - the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan - plus Denmark and Switzerland. The benchmark used to calculate the MFN price would be the second-lowest price within that basket of countries, adjusted by GDP per capita.

From mixed reality to sustainability, let’s take a look back at the roles that have grown in the last two decades, and take a look forward as we predict the jobs of the future in the coming decades. The year is 2010. It’s the turn of a new decade, nostalgia is in, pop history is about to be made (once again) and coloured skinny jeans are quite literally everywhere. Later in the year, we’d see the first woman ever to win an Oscar for Best Director and watch as the launch of a single app (Instagram) and device (iPad) changes the social media and consumer tech landscape forever. 2010 was also the year we witnessed landmark laws like the Equality Act and the Affordable Care Act brought into effect in the UK and US, but what about the work landscape? As technology continues to change the way we learn, live and work, perhaps some of the clearest examples of this transformation can be seen in the workforce. New titles are becoming more commonplace and skills which were practically non-existent to the average employee just a decade ago are now in-demand across sectors. In this blog, we’ll explore this transformation in a little more detail, touching on the roles which didn’t exist in their current form, what’s being done now and look to the future to predict what we think is to come in the next decade or two. In close to two decades, technological needs have transformed the job market, shifted business priorities and shaped skill needs.

Here’s how we can tackle that. As the annual global climate conference, the UN Climate Change Conference ( COP30 ) gets underway in Belém, Brazil, governments, global leaders, scientists and researchers are meeting to decide how to drive faster and bolder action to adapt to climate change, and one thing is clear, there’s never been a more crucial time for climate action and adaptation . However there’s a major problem. We’re short on the one thing we need most: people with the skills to make adaptation possible. While demand for green talent is soaring with hiring rates for green talent being 54.6% greater than hiring rates overall (according to LinkedIn’s Global Green Skills Report 2024), demand greatly outweighs the supply. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 , ‘despite a global 12% increase in workers acquiring green skills between 2022 and 2023, demand continues to outpace supply, with the number of job postings requiring at least one green skill rising by nearly 22% over the same period’. From supply chain decarbonisation, sustainable building and retrofitting to renewable energy and ecosystem management, recent government climate policies mean that green skills are needed now more than ever to fully lead the green transition and meet the climate goals that have been set. So if you’re considering a career change, the climate workforce urgently needs you.

From ‘AI-generated’ becoming part of our modern lexicon to ChatGPT, Face ID and Turnitin being just some examples of AI-powered technologies used practically everyday, AI is well and truly here – but what exactly is AI and how can you use it to work smarter? Keep reading to hear from the AI experts at Accenture, a multinational technology consultancy firm, for their valuable insights and tips. Good question. Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machines simulating human intelligence—learning, reasoning, and making decisions. In 2025, AI is no longer a futuristic concept but a core driver of how we work, live, and innovate. From diagnosing illnesses and generating content to transforming customer service and data analysis, AI is becoming deeply embedded in everyday business operations and our everyday lives. The growth of AI is accelerating rapidly. According to McKinsey , generative AI could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs estimates that up to 300 million jobs worldwide could be affected by AI, with tasks in areas like writing, legal analysis, and design increasingly being automated. While there are growing fears that AI could potentially replace a number of roles, it’s important to note that this technological shift is more about augmentation than replacement—creating space for new roles that complement human skills with AI capabilities.

Keep reading to learn what skills, sectors and jobs you should focus on to put your career at an advantage. Thinking of changing industries? These are some of the fastest-growing industries in 2025.

While extroverts may thrive on social interactions and spontaneous activities, introverts often need time and space to recharge, making the fast-paced and unfamiliar nature of international travel feel overwhelming. If you’re considering studying abroad as an introvert, or are already preparing for your journey, don’t worry—you can absolutely thrive abroad by embracing your personality and planning ahead. This guide will share helpful tips for introverts studying abroad, so you can enjoy your experience with confidence. When planning to study abroad as an introvert , it’s important to select a program that suits your comfort level. Smaller class sizes, quiet campus environments, and culturally respectful destinations might make your experience more enjoyable.

Consider places known for their peacefulness or slower lifestyle.  Where you live can greatly impact how you feel abroad. For introverts, having personal space to unwind is essential. If possible, choose a single room in a dorm or a small shared apartment with respectful, like-minded roommates. Tip: Decorate your space with familiar items from home—it can become a comforting retreat after busy days.
